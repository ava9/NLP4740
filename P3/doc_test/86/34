The ceremony celebrating 70 years of filmmaking in the rugged Alabama Hills 
completed, the white-haired gentleman in the black cowboy hat and fancy Western 
duds tramped over the sagebrush-dotted landscape to have his picture taken. 
</P>
<P>
"That was quite a thing," said former B-Western movie badman Pierce Lyden of 
Orange, a featured guest at the first Sierra Film Festival, held last weekend 
in this tiny town in the shadow of Mt. Whitney on the eastern side of the 
Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," mused Lyden, 82, "I saw a lot of the old fellas today." 
</P>
<P>
During the Sunday afternoon ceremony, Lyden's old friend, Roy Rogers -- the 
festival's guest of honor -- dedicated a plaque commemorating Lone Pine's role 
as one of Hollywood's favorite locations since 1920. 
</P>
<P>
For at least four decades, the sound of gunfire and hoofbeats regularly echoed 
through the Alabama Hills, as the heroic likes of Rogers, Tom Mix, Buck Jones, 
Hopalong Cassidy, Gene Autry and John Wayne galloped through the area's 
picturesque rocks and boulders. 
</P>
<P>
And Lyden, one of the baddest Black Hats in B Westerns, spent many days in the 
Alabama Hills squaring off with Roy, Hoppy and Hollywood's other legendary 
White Hats. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all over this place, but I worked mostly in the 'Bama rocks," recalled 
Lyden, squinting into the afternoon sun as he surveyed the huge boulders in the 
distance, where he took more than a few tumbles for the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
As Lyden says: "I think I've got my name on every one of the rocks. It's 
painful to look at some of them." 
</P>
<P>
The retired actor, looking spiffy in his pearl-buttoned Western shirt with its 
silver-tipped collar, was interrupted by a young woman asking him to autograph 
her book on Western movies. 
</P>
<P>
A smile danced across the movie badman's craggy face. 
</P>
<P>
"Where do you want me to sign?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
A chance to bag an autograph from one of the guest celebrities who worked on 
Westerns filmed in Lone Pine was just one of the draws of the Sierra Film 
Festival, which attracted more than 2,000 visitors. 
</P>
<P>
During a Sunday morning panel discussion, fans were treated to firsthand 
filmmaking memories. Participants included Lyden, stuntman-turned-actor Richard 
Farnsworth ("The Grey Fox"), singing cowboy Eddie Dean, Rand Brooks ("Lucky" in 
the Hopalong Cassidy series), stuntman Joe Yrigoyen (Roy Rogers' stunt double), 
movie bad guy Terry Frost, stuntman Jack Williams, former Rogers leading lady 
Linda Hayes and Rogers' director, William Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day event, co-sponsored by the California Arts Council and the Inyo 
Council for the Arts, also featured stunt shows in the Alabama Hills and 
screenings in the high school auditorium. The Saturday night showing of the 
classic "Gunga Din," perhaps the most famous film shot in Lone Pine, was a 
sellout. 
</P>
<P>
Recalled Farnsworth, who earned $7 a day as an extra on "Gunga Din": "I didn't 
realize there was that much action in that until I saw the film last night." 
</P>
<P>
During the Sunday afternoon plaque dedication, Rogers recalled making his first 
starring feature, 1938's "Under Western Stars," in Lone Pine. "It was," he 
said, "the most impressive time in my life." 
</P>
<P>
The King of the Cowboys, who will be 79 in November but looks at least a decade 
younger, seemed sincerely touched by the large turnout of fans and old 
movie-making colleagues. He summed up his feelings by singing -- and yodeling 
-- a song he recently wrote for his new album: "I Feel Like I've Grown Up With 
Everybody That's Alive and Kickin' Today." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still alive and kicking today too," Rogers told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
For Western fans, however, the big draw of the festival was a chance to take a 
guided bus tour into the Alabama Hills, a place where movie history has been 
played out at almost every turn. 
</P>
<P>
Between the time silent movie comedian Fatty Arbuckle filmed "The Round Up" in 
1920 to the recent science-fiction thriller "Tremors" with Kevin Bacon, more 
than 200 features and serials -- and dozens of TV Westerns and commercials -- 
have been shot in Lone Pine. 
</P>
<P>
To aid film buffs, special photo markers were set up along Movie Road, a narrow 
dirt road that winds through the area of the Alabama Hills dubbed Movie Flats. 
</P>
<P>
Fans, for example, could look at a production still from "Charge of the Light 
Brigade" and see exactly where Errol Flynn halted his British army patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Or they could see the large boulder that Hopalong Cassidy and his sidekick 
California used to hide from the bad guys in "Silent Conflict" in 1947; three 
years later Gene Autry and Pat Buttram hid behind the same boulder in "Beyond 
the Purple Hills." 
</P>
<P>
Film historian Dave Holland of Granada Hills, who was historical consultant for 
the festival, said the appeal of Lone Pine's Alabama Hills to movie-makers is 
obvious. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just no place in the world like it," said Holland, whose new book, "On 
Location in Lone Pine," chronicles the area's film history. "You have the stark 
desert rocks out there and the snow-capped mountains in the background. You 
can't beat that." 
</P>
<P>
Festival coordinator Kerry Powell came up with the idea to hold a film festival 
in Lone Pine. 
</P>
<P>
As a child growing up in the '30s, Powell recalled, she saw some of the sets 
for "Gunga Din." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember the filming, but I remember seeing elephants up there and how 
exciting it was seeing elephants in our hills," she said. "And I did get to see 
Hopalong Cassidy filming over on the Anchor Ranch." 
</P>
<P>
For years, Powell said, she thought that a permanent marker should be erected 
in the Alabama Hills, "so people would realize what happened there. It's really 
a big chunk of Hollywood history." 
</P>
<P>
Orange's Lyden, who has fond memories of working in Lone Pine, is no stranger 
to Western film festivals. He and his wife, Hazel, attend two or three 
different U.S. festivals each year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite a shot in the arm for an old boy like me to be remembered," he said 
Saturday while staffing a table in the exhibit hall. 
</P>
<P>
Lyden was selling copies of his four self-published books chronicling his days 
"riding the reel range." He also offered red T-shirts ("Stick 'Em Up!!!") and 
mugs inscribed, "The Movie Bad Man -- Pierce Lyden." 
</P>
<P>
During his heyday playing Western bad guys, Lyden said, people on the street 
would often say, "I know your face, but I don't know your name." 
</P>
<P>
That's changed today, thanks to the film festivals. 
</P>
<P>
"People know my name now," he said, his hands stuck in the pockets of his fancy 
Western pants. "I get fan mail now, which I never did when I worked. Nobody 
ever sends fan mail to the villains." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, people who watched him in the '30s and '40s as kids come up to him 
today and say they would hiss and boo, throw spit wads and fire their cap 
pistols at the screen whenever he and his badmen cronies came on screen. 
</P>
<P>
"Roy Rogers would beat the devil out of me or something, and that was a big 
laugh for them," he said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
Lyden, who was voted Villain of the Year in a 1944 movie fan poll, retired from 
films in 1962. He spends his time writing free-lance articles about his days 
working in more than 400 films, movie serials and TV shows. And he's thinking 
about writing a fifth volume of his movie memoirs, this time on the serials. 
</P>
<P>
"It keeps me busy, and at my age you've gotta do something. You can't sit in 
that rocking chair," he said as a fan approached him for an autograph. 
</P>
<P>
Lyden shot another B Western badman grin. 
</P>
<P>
"Howya doin'?" he asked.
