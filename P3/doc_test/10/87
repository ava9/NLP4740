Has the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace fallen victim to its own publicity 
wave? 
</P>
<P>
That's the question Kevin Cartwright asks when people say they haven't visited 
yet because they don't want to have to wait in line. 
</P>
<P>
Cartwright, the library's spokesman, said the facility has had an average of 
1,000 visitors a day since opening to the public July 20. At that pace, the 
library's annual attendance would fall short of the 500,000-visitor-a-year 
estimate projected when ground was broken two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Cartwright said he tells people that there are few waits at the library and 
that the building can handle large groups. 
</P>
<P>
He said some people may have the impression there are long waits at the library 
because of the hoopla during its opening, which was attended by President Bush 
and former Presidents Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. The library has 
attracted worldwide attention. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors have ranged from Southern Californians to out-of-state tourists to 
foreign visitors, especially from Japan. Cartwright said that 35 Japanese news 
agencies covered the opening ceremonies, giving the library wide exposure in 
the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Cartwright said the library should appeal to budget-conscious tourists. At 
$3.95 for adults, $2 for senior citizens and free admission for children under 
11, the price of admission is much lower than that of Disneyland or Knott's 
Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the library has managed to attract crowds without a word of paid 
advertising. But Cartwright said that may change. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we would have to have some sort of other ad campaign," he said.
