The Rev. John Huffman reached for a worn Bible in his book-lined study. It was 
a gift, he said, a gesture of graciousness, from a man in the midst of a 
glorious but doomed career. The inscription says that Huffman, as a messenger 
of God's word, "strengthened each of us in the work of peace and human 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
It was signed Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
Now pastor of the 4,000-member St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Newport 
Beach, Huffman wrestles with the day's political issues, like abortion and 
homosexuality. But he's no stranger to the moral hot seat. From 1968-73, the 
years dominated by the war in Vietnam and the Watergate scandal, he was the 
confidante of a besieged President. 
</P>
<P>
Though Huffman, 50, has been pastor of St. Andrew's for 11 years, he said few 
members of his congregation are aware of his past. He has rarely been asked 
about Nixon since the turmoil of the final days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual interview he granted recently, he stressed he could not, as a 
pastor, reveal any confidences made by Nixon at that time. But he did talk 
about his feelings toward Nixon and some of the drama surrounding that 
turbulent era. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled that Nixon, reared an evangelical Quaker, rarely attended church 
services in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"He lived with the fear that the same thing would happen to him that happened 
to Lyndon Johnson -- that he would go to church and be attacked from the 
pulpit." 
</P>
<P>
But when Nixon vacationed in Florida, he and his family attended services at 
Huffman's Presbyterian church in Key Biscayne, Fla., which was recommended to 
Nixon by his friend Bebe Rebozo, a regular churchgoer. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon came to church on Easters, after his inauguration and following his trips 
to China and the Soviet Union. When he came, the services drew about 80 
reporters and were usually picketed by war protesters. One called Huffman a 
"pig" and threatened him with an ice pick, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, news analysts called Huffman, who had his own radio and television 
shows, "flamboyant" and "handsome and not particularly modest." They noted that 
Huffman's rise in prominence paralleled his association with the President. 
Photographs of the two show dark, wavy-haired men who could be brothers. 
</P>
<P>
After Nixon came to his church, he was indeed offered his own television 
ministry but turned it down, he said. "I predicted then the TV ministries would 
get tripped up by finances." 
</P>
<P>
Huffman, who once aspired to politics "as a Christian witness," said Nixon 
appreciated his worldly views as well as his sin-and-repentance style of 
preaching. At Nixon's request, Huffman preached at the White House and held a 
special televised service at Key Biscayne to mark the cease fire in the Vietnam 
War, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The day before the United States invaded Cambodia, Nixon shared intelligence 
information with Huffman over breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked with him behind the scenes about his (political) problems," Huffman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After the Easter Sunday service in 1973 -- amid increasing revelations about 
the Watergate scandal -- Huffman said he walked Nixon to his car and asked him 
directly whether he knew anything about the 1972 break-in at the Democratic 
National Committee offices. "Nixon assured me, 'I knew nothing about it.' I can 
picture his eyes. They were . . . intent." 
</P>
<P>
While Huffman believed him, that day heralded the beginning of a long 
estrangement of the two. Huffman's sermon that day used a Biblical allusion -- 
"The King knoweth of these things . . . this thing was not done in a corner." 
It was widely interpreted by the media as criticism of Nixon's involvement in 
the cover-up and a call for him to repent. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman said the sermon was written before he knew Nixon would attend and was 
not directed at him. But he learned through the "White House people" that 
eventually Nixon suspected the worst -- that he had been attacked from the 
pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the publication of secretly taped conversations between Nixon and his 
aides revealed him to be active in the Watergate cover-up. A Key Biscayne news 
account that included Huffman's reaction carried the headline, "Nixon Lied to 
Me, Former Minister Says." That day, he said, the husband of a church member 
spat in his face and called him "traitor." Although he had moved by that time 
to be pastor of a church in Pittsburgh, Huffman said, "I received hundreds of 
letters across the country, castigating me for attacking the greatest President 
this country ever had." 
</P>
<P>
"It would break my heart if I would ever say anything unkind to him. At the 
same time, the record has to stand as it is. He was one of the most complex, in 
my view brilliant, presidents. And he has a sinister side to him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He certainly dealt with fear, or whatever, in terms of the Kennedys, but he 
would say to this day that he was loyal to John Mitchell and loyalty was one of 
his highest priorities. Others would say, 'How come (White House aides H.R.) 
Haldeman and (John D.) Ehrlichman are in jail?" 
</P>
<P>
As for himself, Huffman said, "I love Richard Nixon." He used the word gracious 
repeatedly to characterize Nixon then and now. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman said he and Nixon have become friends again. He said he wrote the 
pardoned president several years ago praising his speeches on international 
relations and saying he regretted the parting of their paths in 1973. "I said I 
was honestly trying to express my viewpoints on things and I loved him like my 
own father. He wrote back very graciously, saying let's let bygones by bygones. 
Life is too short to carry feelings too long. 
</P>
<P>
"And he sent me his book on leaders, which is very graciously inscribed." 
</P>
<P>
This one reads, "To John Huffman, with best wishes."
