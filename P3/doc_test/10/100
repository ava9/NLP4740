Yorba Linda, which once fought to be designated as the official birthplace of 
former President Richard M. Nixon, now wants to declare his birthday a city 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"President Nixon is definitely in fashion again," declared Yorba Linda Mayor 
Henry W. Wedaa, who proposed the Jan. 9 holiday for city employees. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted 5-0 Tuesday night to request a resolution designating 
the holiday. In two weeks, the council will decide whether to create a new 
holiday or substitute Nixon's birthday for an existing city holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a fine idea," said Councilman Mark Schwing. 
</P>
<P>
In his travels, Wedaa said, he finds that people rarely bring up the Watergate 
scandal that forced Nixon's resignation in 1974. Rather, people often recognize 
Yorba Linda as Nixon's birthplace and the home of the Richard M. Nixon 
Presidential Library, which is scheduled to be completed next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This often leads to many positive comments about what a great president 
history is showing him to be," Wedaa said, adding that he hopes that the Nixon 
Library will schedule special events to coincide with the new Nixon holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Yorba Linda has aggressively staked out its Nixon turf, but the road hasn't 
always been smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Yorba Linda and Whittier, where Nixon grew up, argued over 
which city could claim him as a native son. It was agreed that Yorba Linda 
would be Nixon's birthplace, and Whittier would be Nixon's hometown.
