  [Text] Moscow March 11 TASS -- Dmitriy Simes, adviser of 
the U.S. ex-President Richard Nixon, accompanying him on the 
current visit to Russia, gave new details of Nixon's 
conversation with former Russian vice-president Aleksandr 
Rutskoy. According to Simes, during the meeting Rutskoy said 
that he wanted to run for presidency at the nearest presidential 
elections in Russia. 
  Simes pointed out that in a conversation with Nixon the 
former Russian vice-president said that he intends to carry out 
his political campaign by exclusively lawful means. 
  Simes went on to say that Nixon met with a high-ranking 
official of the State Duma and a representative of the Russian 
Government. He pointed out that the names of those who met with 
the U.S. ex-President would be kept secret at their own request. 
At the same time, Simes said that one of the anonymous 
high-ranking politicians who had asked for a meeting with the 
U.S. ex-President canceled the meeting, saying he was unwell. 
  Returning to the subject of Nixon's having been deprived of 
a 
limousine equipped with a special security system which had 
earlier been in his possession, Simes denied allegations that 
this had been done at the request of the U.S. ex-President's 
entourage. 
  Commenting on the situation around Nixon's visit to Russia, 
Simes declared that the trip turned out to be the best lesson 
for him. "This trip made me realise better than ever how 
decisions are adopted by the Russian Government and what 
relations exist between its constituent parts, how president's 
advisers are operating and what the relations are like between 
the president's entourage and the president himself and the 
State Duma and an extent to which lawmakers can afford to make 
independent decisions. All this was very useful to me," Simes 
said. 
  "The situation which unfolded is unwelcome, but it has 
taught 
us a good lesson, "making us a little bit wiser," Simes said.
