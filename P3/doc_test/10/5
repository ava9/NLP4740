Former President Richard M. Nixon, speaking at a farewell banquet Wednesday 
evening, told his Chinese hosts that the June crackdown on pro-democracy 
protests "will inevitably color American opinion and behavior toward China." 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that many in the United States, including many friends of China, 
believe the crackdown was excessive and unjustified," Nixon said in a toast to 
Chinese President Yang Shangkun, one of the key people responsible for ordering 
troops into Beijing to crush the protests. "The events . . . damaged the 
respect and confidence which most Americans previously had for the leaders of 
China." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon acknowledged that "many Chinese leaders deeply believe that the American 
reaction represents an intrusion in their internal affairs," adding: "The 
age-old clash of ideas that now divides our nations is clear: the assertion of 
sovereignty of the state versus the universal rights of man." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, a copy of whose speech was made available to the foreign press, said 
that U.S. sanctions against China and criticism of the crackdown have caused 
Chinese leaders to "recall bygone days when their nation was bullied and 
exploited by outside powers." 
</P>
<P>
"As a result," he said, "some Chinese now exhibit a distrust of the United 
States that is reminiscent of the period before 1972. The death of innocent 
people was a great tragedy, but another tragedy would be the death of a 
relationship and of policies that have served so well. We must not permit our 
real enemies -- misunderstanding, fruitless resentment, endless recrimination 
-- to close the door we opened with such high hopes 17 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, who is to leave China today after a six-day visit, said that after 20 
hours of "frank and wide-ranging" discussions with Chinese leaders, he still 
cannot say with certainty whether China will continue to move forward with 
reforms or whether it will again close its doors and "revert to the stagnant 
situation that existed before." 
</P>
<P>
Yang, in a toast to Nixon, declared that "Sino-U.S. relations are at a most 
difficult juncture, or, in other words, at a stalemate." 
</P>
<P>
"This state of affairs is not of China's making," Yang said. "China's U.S. 
policy remains the same. . . . It is the United States that has changed." 
</P>
<P>
Yang, whose remarks were summarized in a report by the official New China News 
Agency, said China has done nothing to hurt American interests or to impose its 
views and values on the United States, yet in recent months some Americans have 
become involved in China's internal affairs and have judged events in China by 
American standards. 
</P>
<P>
"They have forgotten," he said, "the lesson of history: Only after waging an 
extremely arduous struggle for over a century did the Chinese people finally 
win their basic rights -- the independence of the state and the dignity of the 
nation." 
</P>
<P>
An American traveling with Nixon, who briefed reporters on the condition that 
he not be identified by name, said that Nixon has privately offered Chinese 
leaders several ideas on measures China might take to help restore friendlier 
ties. He said they include steps in the fields of commercial relations, human 
rights and educational exchanges. Specifically, he said, Nixon suggested that 
police stationed outside the U.S. Embassy stop carrying semiautomatic rifles. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, Nixon chatted with pedestrians along a shopping street, 
then visited the U.S. Embassy for a noon speech to the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday night, for the first time since June, the guards with rifles had 
been withdrawn from outside the embassy, and they were also gone Wednesday. 
Embassy officials expressed optimism that they had been removed permanently. 
Guards armed with pistols remained on duty.
