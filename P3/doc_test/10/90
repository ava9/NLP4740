A LIFE
By Jonathan Aitken
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson,
Pounds 25, 633 pages
About eight years ago the 'Dear Bill' column in Private Eye, the UK
satirical magazine, referred to the Royal Commission set up to investigate
the Falklands war. The fictional Denis Thatcher wrote that it came as no
surprise to him when it concluded on page 864 'the Argies did it'.
If you believe Jonathan Aitken's encomium to Richard Nixon, the blame for
Watergate should be laid at the door of John Dean; or the press blew it out
of all proportion; or any tangential involvement of the 37th president of
the US was explicable by his understandable and compassionate desire to
protect John Mitchell, who was drinking too much.
Indeed, if you can struggle through Jonathan Aitken and if you are a member
of the insufferably superior British political classes, who - with the
exception of a handful of men like Denis Healey - never bother to understand
American politics, you will undoubtedly agree with the author's lofty
conclusion: 'that Richard Nixon, both as a man and a statesman, has been
excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his
virtues'.
The rehabilitation of Mr Nixon has become a fair-sized industry, pursued
with undiminished zeal by the former president himself. This is now extended
to a book by a Tory MP and former journalist. Mr Aitken concedes his oeuvre
was written with the full co-operation of Mr Nixon and his presidential
library. They met in 1966, renewed the acquaintance in 1975, and by 1978 Mr
Aitken was organising the first post-resignation trip to a western country.
Mr Aitken is honest enough to declare his biases whenever he feels
necessary. This should not be necessary. Nixon's achievements - not only in
foreign policy - are not in dispute by serious contemporary historians, like
Stephen Ambrose and Garry Wills. But what both do - and Mr Aitken does not,
beyond noting his awkwardness in discussing certain subjects - is to
acknowledge the dimension of his faults, which are profound.
Watergate may have been the apotheosis of these, but it was not the only
one. Only a blind Nixon adherent could seriously blame Pat Brown (Jerry's
father) for the bitterness of Nixon's notorious concession speech in 1962
after his defeat in the California governor's race. Only someone who shares
Nixon's perception of a world permanently arrayed against him could write
that the hapless George McGovern ran the more unprincipled campaign in 1972.
Only somebody under Nixon's spell could seriously believe that the high
crimes and misdemeanours for which Nixon would have been impeached had he
not resigned were no greater than JFK's links with the Mafia and LBJ's
financial corruption.
No passage more irritates this reviewer than the sub-chapter grandly
entitled 'Watergate Thoughts from Abroad'. Here are vacuities such as 'from
an international perspective, Watergate looked a tragedy of errors not a
catalogue of crimes'. Whose international perspective?
Finally, it should be noted that the rehabilitation does not even now go
unchallenged. An article in last month's New Yorker by Seymour Hersh quotes
from the as-yet unheard Nixon tapes, which have not been released for
general consumption because of the delaying tactics of Mr Nixon's lawyers.
Mr Hersh claims that, in 1972, immediately after George Wallace was shot,
Nixon discussed with Charles Colson sending Howard Hunt to Milwaukee to
plant McGovernite campaign literature in the apartment of Arthur Bremer, the
would-be assassin. Hunt only failed because the FBI had moved with dispatch
and sealed Bremer's apartment.
Was that the real Nixon, or could it be the pasteurised and authorised
version that Mr Aitken would have us believe? The debate will rage forever.
In the meanwhile, read Stephen Ambrose or Garry Wills for something closer
to the truth.
