"Just casual clothes. No black tie." You can't beat that for $25,000, said 
Nancy Olson Livingston, the Music Center's 25th anniversary chairman. She was 
referring to the once-in-a-lifetime trip to the Hawaiian island of Lanai hosted 
by David H. Murdock, chairman of Castle &amp; Cooke Inc. 
</P>
<P>
For the affair, 50 couples will donate $25,000 to the Music Center's 25th 
anniversary. The reward is three days of relaxation at Murdock's new luxury 
resort, The Lodge at Koele, when it's completed. 
</P>
