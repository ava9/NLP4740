THE SECRET RAPTURE (15)Howard Davies
NO ESCAPE (15) Martin Campbell
DANGEROUS GAME (18)Abel Ferrara
INTERSECTION (15) Mark Rydell
There is a funny joke in The Secret Rapture about the difference between
erotic and perverted sex. In the first, gurgles raconteur Joanne
Whalley-Kilmer to a trio of tired business colleagues in a bar, you use a
feather. In the second you use the whole chicken. Hilarity all around. Then
seconds later Miss W-K is lunging across the table with a steak knife,
trying to stab First Businessman.
It is that kind of film. Gestures and apocalypses come from nowhere. David
Hare's stage play was an odd, feathery thing. Addressing matters such as
grace, faith and the quality of life, it made attractive tickling motions in
the direction of our consciences. The film, by contrast, is a turkey, a
whole turkey and a plucked turkey. And since this turkeyisation process has
happened to Hare before - when Plenty moved from play to film, and when
Paris By Night and Strapless trailed clouds of staginess on to the screen -
we should ask: What is going wrong?
The Secret Rapture has one of those plots, full of designer metaphor, that
one accepts while sitting in the hothouse of a theatre. An old bookseller
has died, leaving his two daughters to cope with the dear old farmhouse and
the deadly young widow: Catherine (Miss W-K), a sort of Hell's Angel on
heels; younger daughter Isobel (Juliet Stevenson), good and kind, runs a
small graphic design shop; older daughter Marion (Penelope Wilton), more
venal, is first caught trying to reclaim a ring from dead Dad's bedside.
But there is one thing that plays can get away with and films cannot.
Circumstantial vagueness. We do not expect the stage to rotate 45 degrees
towards us, exposing the designs on top of Isobel's work-tables. But in a
movie we ask, 'What are these people designing?', apart from the single
lurid bookjacket being worked over by Isobel's partner-boyfriend (Neil
Pearson).
So when well-heeled Marion buys into the firm and tries to expand it with
harpy Catherine's help, we are meant to cry 'Tsk] Tsk] Do not sell out,
Isobel'; but instead we feel, 'What a good idea.' Perhaps the firm will now
take on a graspable identity.
More vagueness: Penelope Wilton's Marion, who clarion-announced herself as a
Tory minister in the play, here seems vocationally less specific. And her
husband, a lay preacher on stage full of chortlesome pieties, is played by
Alan Howard in the movie as an odd, mute bird with a crick in his neck and
few lines of dialogue.
Director Howard Davies pushes bits of style at Hare's screenplay as if
hoping that they will peck it into life. A moment of emotion produces a
tilted angle. A love scene stripes two bodies with Venetian-blind shadows.
But when a bird is dead, as Monty Python proved, no amount of shock
treatment can help. Plucked of its wit and thrust into the 'real' world, the
moral schematic of Hare's play seems trite and sanctimonious. Hold on to
that cottage industry. Hug that parental farmhouse (shades, nay swathes, of
Howards End). And cherish the mentally distressed, who might be
well-intentioned (Catherine), while shunning the mercantile (Marion), who
cannot ever be.
Nothing is more dopily conservative than some writers with left-wing
sympathies. People often ask why British films cannot get their act
together.
The reason is that modern British cinema, like so much modern British life,
is one long apology pro sua vita. 'We have never had it so bad.' And
(corollary) 'we shall never have it so good again', unless, quoth Hare, we
put a moratorium on all that might expand people's lives, ambitions and
imaginations and thereby threaten tight little, green little England.
Now a much-needed change of scene. 'The nearest aspirin is 2,000 miles
away,' says the doctor (Ian McNiece) on the subtropical island in No Escape.
We have all known holiday spots like this, but 'Absolom' is an atoll of a
different aspect. Even though the jokey convicts' leader (Stuart Wilson)
says 'Welcome to vacation paradise' to the newly arrived hero (Ray Liotta) -
and Liotta, picking up the mood, replies 'Hope you take plastic' - this is a
futuristic penal colony (year 2022) where torture, riot and sudden death are
rife.
Can Liotta, sent here after threatening a previous warden with an electric
cattle-prod, escape - or at least find a more pleasant part of the island?
He does the latter, falling down a mile-high cliff into a river from which
the Good Convicts, led by white-haired father figure Lance Henriksen, rescue
him. But will Wilson pursue and avenge?
The film is a re-tread of Papillon with camp dialogue, wild scenery and
costumes that look as if they were designed by Mad Max's aunt. Present is a
platoon of British actors, led by Wilson and McNiece, playing the nasties
and causing us to ask: What is it with Hollywood and the British? Can
America not get one of its own kind to curl a lip, quiver a nostril and
deliver a well-egged epigram? Perhaps not. Wilson's jokes steal the movie.
Abel Ferrara's Dangerous Game used to be called Snake Eyes. But like last
week's Hostile Hostages (US title The Ref) it has been re-baptised for
Britain by the banal minds who do these things. No title, though, could do
justice to this transportingly batty film about film-making from the
writer-director of Driller Killer and Bad Lieutenant. An earnest Madonna and
a more earnest James Russo act out a tale of marital hell before the cameras
of fictive filmer Harvey Keitel.
Whose are the snake eyes? Perhaps Madonna's; but it is mostly too dark to
tell on this soundstage within a soundstage. Or maybe they are Keitel's, who
has long, writhing Medusa locks to match. The film replays the contest
between vice and virtue that we saw in Lieutenant: only with Madonna as the
wife who is getting religion and Russo as the man burning out on sex and
drugs.
No one seems more obsessional, though, than the man behind the camera,
OD-ing on celluloid and Stanislavski-babble. Like any genius director Keitel
wants more. 'Smell her, Frank, smell her'; 'Dig down into hell, Frank';
'Piss on the floor'. The audience, on the other hand, wants less. But it has
an eerie feeling that this is what life is like on a Ferrara set, and we
might as well have the ugly truth while it is offered.
Intersection also comes from the world's psychodrama storage-room. Richard
Gere takes the Michel Piccoli role in this Hollywood defrosting of the 1970
French film Les Choses De La Vie. Mark Rydell (The Rose) replaces Claude
Sautet in the director's chair, blowing warm air all over the tale of a man
whose life is torn between two women and whose mind replays that life, in
flashbacks, just as his car is about to be torn between two trucks.
Gere's past career as a Vancouver-based architect flashes before him. His
affair with redheaded Lolita Davidovich flashes before him. And the blonde,
curvaceous Sharon Stone flashes before him - but this is not Basic Instinct.
Stone, playing Mrs Gere, gets to expose nothing lower than a quivering chin
and a pair of Joan Crawford cheekbones. The film is minor but enjoyable.
