</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There they were -- Liz and Malcolm -- together under the stars on a moonlit 
night, listening to Bolero as fireworks exploded high over Arabian tents and 
out into the glistening Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
The rhythmic music and the dazzling fireworks climaxed together, each reaching 
a crescendo and abruptly ending in unison to the cheers of another 1,000 people 
whom publisher Malcolm Forbes had invited along with his date, Elizabeth 
Taylor, to celebrate his 70th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Liz and Malcolm were what the guests had come to see -- together with his 
gleaming-white Moroccan palace (Palais Mendoub) and, actually, each other. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Politicians 
</P>
<P>
Celebrity guests included opera star Beverly Sills (she sang "Happy Birthday"), 
Henry Kissinger, Walter Cronkite and Barbara Walters. 
</P>
<P>
There were hardly any politicians, but California's Gov. George Deukmejian was 
one, apparently because Forbes likes his fiscal conservatism. Republican Gov. 
Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey -- Forbes' home state -- also was there. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, however, the guest list read like a who's who of corporate 
America -- Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca, General Motors Chairman Roger B. 
Smith and hundreds of other business and financial executives -- and clearly 
represented an effort to attract advertising to Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"They are all friends," Forbes said of his guests, "and some of them have 
proven it by the amount of business they have put into Forbes magazine." 
</P>
<P>
And to his guests as he and Liz were about to cut the huge four-layer birthday 
cake around midnight Saturday, Forbes acknowledged: "If it hadn't been my 
birthday we would have thought of a different reason (to party). The birthday 
was incidental." 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier generation, another publisher -- William Randolph Hearst -- used 
to invite celebrities from Hollywood up to his "ranch" at San Simeon. They 
would arrive by the scores in automobiles or in trains and spend the weekend 
with Hearst and his celebrity girlfriend, Marion Davies, at La Casa Grande. 
</P>
<P>
In the jet age, the publishing world's biggest party-giver is Forbes. And for 
this soiree he flew most of the guests at his expense in three chartered jets 
-- including a Concorde -- across the Atlantic to party with him and Liz. He 
put everybody up at two seaside hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the chartered planes alone was around $1 million, according to one 
Forbes official: $500,000 for the Concorde, $300,000 for a 747 and $200,000 for 
a DC-8. 
</P>
<P>
But Forbes told reporters he doubted the party's tab would reach the $2-million 
figure that has been estimated because things are cheaper in Morocco and also 
because Morocco's King Hassan II -- who threw a lavish farewell lunch and 
picnic for the entire group on Sunday at the Tangier Country Club -- supplied 
all of the music and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the cost will be written off as a business expense and become a Forbes 
tax deduction -- meaning that American taxpayers will wind up subsidizing a lot 
of the fun for these rich party-goers. "I wish it was entirely," Forbes replied 
when asked whether he considered the party a business expense. "Some of it is." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, Forbes said he did not feel the slightest bit guilty about spending 
all that money on one extravagant party. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody asked me, 'How do you defend it?' " Forbes said. "It's difficult. You 
can point out that we give several million dollars a year to philanthropies and 
worthy causes. But that doesn't explain why we didn't use all this money for 
the same thing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"There's nobody here," he told the reporters, "who doesn't, maybe, on their 
wife's birthday take her to the theater or dinner or something and do you say 
to yourself, 'Gee, instead of that, I should have given it to the local chapter 
of the Red Cross.' We all do things in our lives that probably aren't 
essential. It's just that this scale is more visible. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel guilty about it. I feel grateful that we can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Forbes -- who has named his private jet Capitalist Tool and painted its tail 
what he calls "money green" -- inherited a fortune from his self-made father, 
B.C. Forbes, who founded the magazine. But Malcolm has multiplied that fortune 
many times over and now is worth "somewhere between half a billion and a 
billion," said Forbes communication director William Donald Garson. "Honestly, 
he doesn't know what he is worth." 
</P>
<P>
A flamboyant motorcyclist and hot air balloon enthusiast -- "It's very hard to 
be anonymous when you're flying a Sphinx balloon over Cairo," he noted Saturday 
-- Forbes entered Elizabeth Taylor's life two years ago when he handed her a 
$1-million check to fight AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what Liz gave him for his birthday, the divorced Forbes said, "I am not 
telling, as a matter of fact." But then he paused for a second and added: "One 
of the things she gave me was Elizabeth Taylor's passion for me." 
</P>
<P>
He described their relationship as "happy," but said the actress should not be 
considered his "fiancee. We have finessed around that. . . . You don't have to 
marry somebody before you have fun together. . . . She's got wit and wisdom and 
love." 
</P>
<P>
Forbes said he threw the party because "I just wasn't that confident I would be 
here or, if here, capable of enjoying my 100th. So I decided to have it on the 
70th." 
</P>
<P>
"I know they'll top it on his 75th," said Kissinger, who has been to a few gala 
affairs himself, "but for now, it has to be the most unusual party I have 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Once-in-a-Lifetime' 
</P>
<P>
Said Deukmejian, who is not much of a party-goer but echoed the sentiments of 
most guests: "There's no question it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience." 
</P>
<P>
You know you've been to something special when they have designer outdoor 
toilets that flush. The toilets -- five of them designed locally by a food 
caterer -- had His and Her enclosed stalls under a small Arabian tent with 
black and white tile floors and a sink. (But they had one common problem of 
most outdoor heads: no towels, so people used soggy toilet paper to wipe their 
hands.) 
</P>
<P>
This is a little of what it was like to attend Malcolm Forbes' three-day 
"Ali-Dada Birthday Bash." (A play on the name Ali-Baba): 
</P>
<P>
For ordinary guests -- the Kissingers, the Betsy Bloomingdales, the Cronkites, 
the Deukmejians and folks even more ordinary than that -- it was an early 
wake-up Friday for arrival at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport by 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
There also was another, much smaller category of guests who used their own jets 
-- people like Chrysler's Iacocca and Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner. 
These people had more flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
For an example, financier Henry Kravis and his wife, fashion designer Carolyne 
Roehm, planned to have their private jet meet them Sunday in Tangier so they 
could take another couple to dinner in Venice en route to the Salzburg Music 
Festival, the next stop on their summer fun calendar of social globe trotters. 
</P>
<P>
There were other twists, too, in individual travel arrangements. Publisher 
Rupert Murdoch, for instance, chartered a yacht and brought it to Tangier so he 
could host a Saturday luncheon for roughly 100 select guests, including 
Deukmejian and his wife, Gloria. 
</P>
<P>
But for about 600 people, the weekend began shortly after dawn Friday with a 
crush of limousines and taxicabs -- family sedans were scarce -- outside a 
private hangar at JFK. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the confusion of hundreds of people trying to check in and dump off their 
bags, the partying began with the chanting of Moroccan musicians shaking 
tambourines and other instruments. Then came a belly-dancer in a tight-fitting, 
low-cut dress. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, sitting at a table under a tent right in front of the dancer, shook 
his head to the rhythm, stretched out his arms and snapped his fingers. "I do 
this every morning at 8:30," he told a reporter, smiling. In a few minutes, the 
governor -- grinning ear to ear -- stood briefly near the woman and began 
dancing himself, twisting and turning and clicking the fingers. 
</P>
<P>
After an elaborate continental breakfast prepared by caterer Basil Rathbone -- 
granddaughter of the late film star Basil Rathbone -- Deukmejian and 99 other 
passengers boarded the Concorde. The sleek, narrow craft flew at twice the 
speed of sound, cruising at around 50,000 feet, and arrived at Tangier on the 
northwestern tip of Africa, just opposite Gibraltar, in three hours, 20 minutes 
-- about half the normal time. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Moroccan musicians greeted guests aboard all three chartered jets 
at the airport. And thousands of curious citizens lined the streets into town 
to catch a glimpse of the rich Americans. More musicians entertained at the 
hotel -- and virtually every place the guests traveled throughout the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian and his wife spent part of Saturday shopping in the famed Kasbahs, 
but didn't buy anything. "We were trying to keep up with our guide. We didn't 
want to get lost in that maze," said Gloria Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The weather was hot and humid. The hotel rooms had no air-conditioning and 
everybody was sweating -- except, strangely, at the birthday party where guests 
wearing the required tuxedoes and formals were spared by a cool, gentle breeze 
that blew off the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
"The party works better in Morocco -- there's a romance and mystique about 
being far from home," noted advice columnist Abigail Van Buren. "It's 
glamorous, it's spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of white-robed musicians and green-capped Royal Calvary guards wearing 
turbans met guests outside the palace. Then the guests drew their dinner 
seating assignments from a brass bowl. Deukmejian sat in the "Money Green" 
tent, one of seven Arabian tents erected on the terrace gardens overlooking the 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes, wearing green Scottish kilts, stood in the reception line with his four 
sons and one daughter for more than two hours greeting the steady stream of 
guests. Many people, after having gone through the line themselves, just stood 
around and ogled the other guests. 
</P>
<P>
This was especially true when Elizabeth Taylor stood beside Forbes, which was 
most of the time. She wore a floor-length emerald green caftan with gold 
metallic braiding and long diamond and ruby earrings. Her hairdo could be best 
described as free-form and she again seemed to be losing her battle against 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner -- pastilla (pigeon pie), barbecued lamb, chicken and fruits -- 
lasted until nearly midnight. And guests didn't begin leaving until after 1 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at it now," a man said to nobody in particular as one of the chartered 
buses pulled away from the palace. "You'll never see it again."

FOR THE RECORD

Malcolm Forbes -- A story in Monday's Times about publisher Malcolm Forbes' 
birthday party in Tangier contained a typographical error in a quote in which 
he described a present he received from actress Elizabeth Taylor. The correct 
quote is: "One of the things she gave me was Elizabeth Taylor's Passion for 
Men," a reference to a perfume that bears the actress' name.
