Jet Pilot (Channel 13 Tuesday at noon): The legendary, long unreleased Howard 
Hughes-Josef von Sternberg film maudit, a kind of Hell's Angels updated to the

Show People (Z Wednesday at 11:30 a.m.): King Vidor's wonderful 1928 silent,

gifts; William Randolph Hearst preferred to restrict her to tony costume 
pictures. (1:30)
