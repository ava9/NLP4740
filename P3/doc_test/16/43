</P>

<P>
Futuristic. Fabulous. Foxy. Fun. Funny. Friendly. The world premiere of "Back 
to the Future Part II" last week, drawing 1,500 guests to the Cineplex Odeon 
Universal City Cinemas (four theaters), was all that. The bonus was that it 
benefited TRIPOD to help families with hearing-impaired children. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Mary Ellen Trainor Zemeckis said: "We've got $400,000 tonight. Net. 
TRIPOD's a great organization. It's about the future of children, and this is 
about the future." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd couldn't get close enough to star Michael J. Fox and wife Tracy 
Pollan (in slinky black) and to Robert Zemeckis, the director. With three party 
tents connected by black time tunnels, Fox was hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
But there he was, in the roped '50s area, surrounded by Universal president Tom 
Pollock, Bob Gale, Steve Starkey, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas 
Wilson. Close by were James Woods, Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, Michael Douglas, Michael Valenti, Chevy 
Chase, Woody Harrelson, Mark Cowan and Mary Shea, Peter and Robin Barker, and 
Michael Shamberg and his wife, Megan Williams, who helped start TRIPOD seven 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Most parties have one tent. Ambrosia Caterers vice president David Corwin 
created three. The "past" became a pleasure palace with gaming tables; the '50s 
tent sported a mermaid and band with dancers bopping through balloons and 
tinsel to "Hit the Road, Jack." The futuristic setting took the form of steel 
grids and a bar in an atmosphere too dark to see stars, but providing anonymity 
for pigging out. 
</P>
<P>
Beamed MCA president Sid Sheinberg: "This movie's like a Swiss watch." So was 
the party. 
</P>
<P>
PAST PERFECT: The business tycoons ventured into archeology the other evening 
when John and Marion Anderson opened their Bel-Air home to the Board of 
Visitors of the John E. Anderson Graduate School of Management at UCLA (which 
the Andersons endowed with $15 million). 
</P>
<P>
The prominent group became the first to see Christopher B. Donnan's newest 
slides of the royal tombs from the Moche civilization discovered recently in 
Peru. Donnan, professor of anthropology and director of the UCLA Museum of 
Cultural History, said the tombs have yielded some of the greatest pieces of 
jewelry ever found in the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
Oohing over the gold warrior priest and intricate spiders were J. Clayburn La 
Force, dean of the Graduate School of Management, and wife Barbara, Jim and 
Carol Collins, Dick and Susan Roll, Jim and Inge Miscoll and political 
economist James Q. Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
DONORS: Celebrating the continued building of a significant permanent 
collection for Los Angeles and the Museum of Contemporary Art, MOCA, headed by 
Richard Koshalek, recently dedicated the Collection Donor Galleries at Bunker 
Hill and opened two exhibitions including "Selections from the Beatrice and 
Philip Gersh Collection." 
</P>
<P>
About 300 friends of the Gershes including Jeff Kastenberg, Steve Martin, 
Marcia Weisman and Ed Ruscha were there; 50 moved on to late-night dining at 
Rex restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
ELEGANCE: Mary Smith (Mrs. William French Smith) and Bullocks Wilshire cast 
floral elegance on the luncheon to meet London's floral decorator Kenneth 
Turner, in town to open his new boutique at Bullocks Wilshire and to tout the 
Southern California Committee for Shakespeare's Globe Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Guests included Michael York (quoting Shakespeare), I. Magnin CEO Rose Marie 
Bravo, Constance Gavin (just returned from Las Cruces), Iona Brown, Joan 
Hotchkis, Jennifer Diener, Flora Thornton and Marion Jorgensen. 
</P>
<P>
TO HONOR: Mayor of Cannes Michel Mouillot was in the spotlight last week. 
Chardee and Thomas Trainer feted him in their Beverly Hills home, inviting 
former President Ronald and Nancy Reagan. French Consul Gen. Gerard and Naomi 
Coste hosted another reception Wednesday at their home. 
</P>
<P>
Chardee Trainer is a trustee of Pine Manor College, which is co-sponsoring a 
program of French studies at the International College of Cannes, where the 
mayor is chairman. 
</P>
<P>
BACCHUS: The ancient Greek and Roman god of wine and revelry was revered the 
other evening at the California Wine Patrons at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
Before dinner, hotelier Alain M. Longatte saluted 13th annual Bacchus Banquet 
awardees: restaurateur Michael McCarty, Domaine Chandon CEO John Wright and Los 
Angeles Times wine writer Dan Berger. 
</P>
<P>
News of the night was the opening of the California Wine Exhibit at the Museum 
of Science and Industry to pay tribute to Hernando Courtright, late owner of 
the Beverly Wilshire. Among those in the spotlight were Fiorenza Courtright, 
Jack P. Hennessy, chairman of the California Wine Patrons, Raoul Balcaen, 
Patrons president, and Bob and Margie Petersen. 
</P>
<P>
PLAUDITS: To Frank and Barbara McNamara, celebrating a 40th anniversary with 
dinner and friends at Annandale Golf Club. . . .
