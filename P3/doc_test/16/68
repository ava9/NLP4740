"I thought I would find it all very distracting and too pretty to concentrate 
on the Holocaust here in West Hollywood," says actress Gordana Rashovich. "But 
I went to the Simon Wiesenthal Center and I watched a show about Hitler on TV, 
so there was no problem refocusing."

Rashovich is repeating her haunting, Obie Award-winning performance in Barbara 
Lebow's acclaimed drama "A Shayna Maidel," currently playing at the Tiffany 
Theater in West Hollywood. Set in New York City in 1946, "Shayna Maidel" tells 
the story of two Jewish sisters, one brought up in the United States and the 
other a survivor of a Nazi concentration camp in Poland, and their father, who 
reunite after a separation of 20 years. Rashovich plays Luisa, the fragile, 
painfully thin and ghostly pale survivor, haunted by the memories of her dead 
mother, baby daughter and best friend, and obsessed with finding her missing 
husband.

The actress originated the role of Luisa five years ago at the Hartford Stage 
in Connecticut and appeared in the hit Off-Broadway production for nearly a 
year. Rashovich finds working with a new cast and director (Deborah LaVine) 
stimulating. "It's like visiting an old friend in a foreign country, someone 
you don't get to see on a daily basis. You go back and the same things are 
rekindled, the same kind of friendships, the same kind of bonds." 
</P>
<P>
Rashovich prepared for her role by reading books and watching films on the 
Holocaust. "I am a little shy about asking direct questions to survivors," she 
says. "If they are interested in telling me things, I will sit there. But 
reading is private. You can do it at home and you can personalize it."

She also drew on her European trips as a youngster (her father is Yugoslav, her 
mother American). "I always heard war stories there," she remembers. "These 
people didn't forget World War II. It was in their back yard. I will never 
forget those stories -- how people had to hide in the forest and eat wood to 
survive. I think that left an indelible impression upon me." SUSAN KING
