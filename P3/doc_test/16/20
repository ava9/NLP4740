HOLLY HUNTER sits in the beauty shop chair, staring into the mirror and 
contemplating several hair styles. The actress is trying to find the best look 
for her next film, "Once Around," with Richard Dreyfuss. "Lori, whaddya think?" 
she asks in her decidedly Southern drawl. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a new question to hairdresser Lori Davis, who colors, perms and 
cuts the hair of many a Hollywood star. In addition to Hunter, Davis' clients 
include Meryl Streep, who visits between films to have her natural pale-blond 
color restored; Cher, who comes in for perms, and Bette Midler, who had her 
hair dyed red for "Beaches" and blond for "Stella." 
</P>
<P>
But Davis' work isn't limited to women. Arnold Schwarzenegger has been a 
regular at Lori Davis Hair Doctor since his "Conan the Barbarian" days. Nick 
Nolte insists on having Davis flown to his film locations to match his hair 
color and style to his role. Sean Penn and Tom Cruise drop in for trims. And 
"Cheers" star Ted Danson, who gets a Davis cut and conditioning every two 
weeks, comes in for color as well when he needs it for film work. "To make his 
hair look its natural shade on the big screen," Davis says, "we have to make it 
a little darker than how he wears it on television." 
</P>

Davis may handle more superstar tresses on a regular basis than any other salon 
stylist in Southern California, yet she manages to do so without Tinseltown 
trappings. In fact, her salon is pure down-home. "They (celebrities) don't come 
here for ambiance," says Davis, her own long, blond hair framing her face. The 
16x16-foot room she rents in the Brentwood Continental salon in West Los 
Angeles is separated from the rest of the shop by a rattling, wooden sliding 
door. Paper teddy bears festoon the mirror. Davis' cosmetology licenses, 
plaques with cute sayings and a promotional photo signed "with love" from 
Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito (who, she says, met in her salon) adorn the 
walls.

Many of the actors and actresses who come to this funky little workroom to 
entrust their hair to Davis have been referred by other actors or by studio 
hairdressers, who also depend on Davis' expertise with color and other chemical 
hair treatments. "My hair was destroyed after I did 'Miss Firecracker,' " 
Hunter recalls, "and Lori saved it." During the making of that film about three 
years ago, Hunter's hair was dyed red several times, which stripped it of its 
moisture and sheen. So Davis restored the actress's natural shade of brown and 
used deep conditioners to bring back its soft texture. "She's been with me ever 
since," Davis says. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Davis introduced her own line of hair-care products, Designers' Mane 
Collection, which uses many of the same formulas she has applied on her famous 
clients. The stars can buy her products in her workroom; the products are 
available to the public at Frends Beauty Supply Co. in North Hollywood and 
through mail-order. 
</P>
<P>
For many celebrities, Davis has found, extra conditioning is important. NBC 
news correspondent Maria Shriver gets frequent moisturizing treatments to keep 
her hair shiny under drying studio lights. "Cheers" star Rhea Perlman's hair 
requires constant care to keep it looking curly rather than out of control. 
"Now that it's shoulder length, she has versatility," Davis explains, "but 
keeping it shiny requires regular deep-conditioning." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, stars will ask Davis for a totally new look. If they are between 
films or TV shows, she'll indulge the whim. For instance, about five years ago, 
she transformed Cher's dark mane to "a punked-out blond," Davis remembers. "We 
cut it all off into a crew cut and bleached it almost white, but that meant 
constant touch-ups. Unless you have plenty of time for upkeep, going from dark 
brown to blond is torture -- and expensive." She gave Cher the same advice she 
gives other brunettes: "Don't be a blonde unless you can afford the time and 
money to touch up every two weeks." Cher was back to her natural brown in less 
than six months. 
</P>
<P>
Davis calls herself one of a vanishing breed of hairdressers: "You know, the 
ones who do everything -- without assistants -- who shampoo and color and perm 
and cut." She does concede, though, that she doesn't do blow-dries: "After 23 
years with a hairbrush in my hand, my wrists hurt." But it doesn't seem to 
matter because Davis' cuts fall perfectly into place as clients wield their own 
hair dryers, and the color of their locks shines so naturally that one wonders 
if Davis ever, well, goofs.

"No, honey, I don't fail," she says. "If I were to fail, I'd fail big."
