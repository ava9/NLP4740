Beneath a wall of marble-trimmed graves, on the stone steps of a mortuary, 200 
squealing children Tuesday cut, pasted and crayoned messages of love in Forest 
Lawn Memorial-Park's annual valentine-making contest. 
</P>
<P>
Braving blustery winds and chilly temperatures, the local children worked 
feverishly, oblivious to the looming presence of a three-story mausoleum with 
its rows of brass nameplates. But that was precisely the contest organizers' 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
Launched in 1971 as a way to ease children's fears of cemeteries, the Forest 
Lawn contest has grown into one of the biggest Valentine's Day events in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole purpose was to encourage families and children to enjoy the park 
area so that they don't think of Forest Lawn as a gruesome place," said 
Christine Klima, former director of the Cypress mortuary. "And it was such a 
hit that we kept it up. It got bigger and bigger every year, and now it's just 
teeming with kids." 
</P>
<P>
Klima said the contest for children ages 2 to 12 began with only 20 
participants. On Tuesday, carloads of them arrived for the event. 
</P>
<P>
The children -- wearing an array of holiday colors from crimson to Day-Glo pink 
-- created valentines from construction paper, pipe cleaners, crayons, Cupid 
stickers and lacy, heart-shaped doilies, all supplied by the mortuary. 
</P>
<P>
As the youngsters worked feverishly to complete their projects in the alloted 
25 minutes, none appeared to be disturbed by the unusual surroundings. In fact, 
many of them said they had been to the cemetery before to visit family graves. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandpa is buried here, so I'm used to it," said Christina Jackson, 11, of 
Buena Park. "I think it's a good place. I even gave my valentine to my grandpa 
last year." 
</P>
<P>
Parents watched the scene from a nearby stone ledge as the laughing children 
chased paper decorations scattered by the strong breeze, and took crayons in 
hand to draw crooked-lined hearts which declared their love for mom and dad. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids just think it's a pretty place," said parent Kim White. "It's no big 
deal. We have relatives and friends buried here, and we're going to go to the 
mausoleums when this is done." 
</P>
<P>
A maintenance worker silently surveyed the scene as volunteers judged the 
contest results. In a matter of minutes, the once-spotless stone steps had 
become covered with paper scraps, dropped doilies, broken crayons and globs of 
glue. 
</P>
<P>
Contest judge Ray Thomson, director of the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Cypress, 
praised Forest Lawn Memorial-Park and said children from the club have 
participated in the contest since it began. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an appropriate endeavor for them because in the crisis of death, there 
is always a lot of love and close connections, and that's also what Valentine's 
Day is about," Thomson said. 
</P>
<P>
Darin Drabing, vice president of the Cypress mortuary, said, "It's a nice way 
to let children be exposed to a cemetery and to make a somewhat frightening 
experience become not so terrible." 
</P>
<P>
White, however, doubted that children were naturally afraid of cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
"It all depends on how the grown-ups act," she said. "The attitude of the 
parents is what can scare their kids."
