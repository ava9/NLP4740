We just can't seem to escape exercise no matter how far we go. 
</P>
<P>
Even if we travel to Mars, where U.S. scientists are planning a joint trip with 
the Soviets. Or to the moon, where scientists dream of orbiting space platforms 
and mining communities. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, if the Lunar-Mars initiative -- what these dreams are officially called -- 
becomes reality, so will the problems of microgravity, a condition that has 
one-sixth the gravity of Earth. The last time a U.S. astronaut spent prolonged 
time in space travel, in the Skylab series in the '70s, he returned a little 
bit shorter because of bone loss in the heel bone. A fair amount of 
cardiovascular and muscle deterioration also occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists learned from Skylab, which orbited the earth for 84 days, and also 
from a one-year Soviet space mission, that astronauts have physical problems 
adjusting to microgravity and then readjusting to earth. 
</P>
<P>
"It took about two or three weeks for our astronauts to physically come back to 
normal after Skylab, and reports are that it took a month or two for the 
Russians . . . and we don't know if the Russians regained their bone loss or 
not," said Dr. Bernard Harris of the Johnson Space Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Because bone is a living tissue, it will respond to the stress that is placed 
on it. In space there is little stress, so the bone actually decreases in size 
to make the skeleton lighter. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, according to some researchers, is that after two or three years in 
space a human may not regain the same level of bone and bone density, which in 
turn could result in a loss of strength. 
</P>
<P>
The prescription to this dilemma -- scientists believe -- is exercise. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Space Station Freedom, scheduled to launch in 1996, will include an 
exercise facility in the spaceship. 
</P>
<P>
The facility will include a treadmill, a bike rower used for cycling and 
rowing, and a weightlfiting machine called a tork. The tork has an electric 
motor to provide resistance, and different attachments to perform bicep curls, 
tricep extensions and leg and military presses. 
</P>
<P>
Exercise in space results in other problems. Scientists are trying to make the 
exercise period short enough so that it does not impact the space mission. 
</P>
<P>
"We have ongoing studies in simulated microgravity to see if we can cram an 
entire daily activity that a person would do, including the exercise, into a 
two-hour period, which would include the treadmill and bike rower, etc," Harris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To determine force, Harris doubles a person's body weight and then multiplies 
that figure by the number of steps the person takes during a day. A program is 
then prescribed on the treadmill, adjusting speed, grade and steps to equal the 
required amount of force expenditure. 
</P>
<P>
"We put the subject in bed and get him up for any period of time you are going 
to cram this into," Harris said. "Actually, some health spas are taking this 
concept and coming up with 30 minute workouts. The body experiences the total 
load and force that you would have if you worked out for two hours at a lower 
intensity." 
</P>
<P>
Exercise in space will have a different twist and produce different results. In 
running, for example, elastic cords, which may be the business of the future, 
will be used to keep a runner on the ground. Because there is little gravity, 
there will be no force generated from the weight of the runner's foot hitting 
the ground. The major force expended will be from the resistance of the runner 
moving against the elastic cords. 
</P>
<P>
In weightlifting, force must be produced because nothing weighs anything in 
space. 
</P>
<P>
"So if you lift five pounds down here with your biceps, you are lifting against 
gravity and are also holding your arm up against gravity," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take the same body and put it into microgravity, it's not lifting 
anything but pulling against the weight itself. So the characteristics of 
weightlifting will be different." 
</P>
<P>
The alternative to trying to exercise in microgravity is to produce artificial 
gravity in space. At the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif., 
researchers are studying the creation of artificial gravity through 
centrifugation -- rotating the spacecraft, which is connecting to a rotating 
device, by a long chain. One of the Gemini missions experimented with the 
concept and it was deemed it feasible. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Rob Whalen, a research scientist at Ames, says scientists are also studying 
the relationship between exercising at a higher gravity level, even higher than 
the 1G on earth, for a shorter period of time. They also are studying the use 
of simulating the earth's gravity for intermittent exposure to astronauts in 
space travel. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now in our technology we don't have the means to produce artificial 
gravity effectively, but we know that is probably the answer to space travel 
and life in space," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, exercise, as well as sports, could be performed in space in much 
the same as on earth. But it may not be as much fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I was asked a couple of years ago if we could play football on the moon, " 
Harris said. "I said yes, but since the moon's gravity is one sixth that of the 
earth's, we would have to have a field about six times as large, because you 
could throw the ball farther. Each step you take would be a longer one. There 
are things unique to the moon that would make sports very interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Harris also thinks the environment of space will create its own sports, whether 
a variance of sports as we know them on or new sports. 
</P>
<P>
"Jumping may be a possibility," he said, laughing.
