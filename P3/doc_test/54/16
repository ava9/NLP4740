On the evening of July 20, the Arts and Entertainment cable television network 
ran the complete coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing and walk. It served 
only to refresh memories that will remain until death. Who can forget that 
night 20 years ago? Who can forget the pride of nationhood? Who can forget the 
excitement and the wonder? 
</P>
<P>
Evidently quite a few people have chosen to do so. The media tell us that 
Woodstock, for example, was far more significant -- despite the fact that more 
Americans traveled to Florida to watch Apollo 11 blast off than to have their 
ears blasted and their minds altered in that muddy New York pasture. 
</P>
<P>
That false impression lingers to this date. It is a routine matter for hundreds 
of thousands of Americans to drive their cars and campers to the causeways near 
Cape Canaveral or the desert flatlands of California to watch the space shuttle 
launch and land. Yet social critics would tell us that the fact that so many 
American citizens make those pilgrimages is less significant than a shrill 
demonstration for some social issue or other -- in which, of course, the media 
has greater interest. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps this fact demonstrates the nature of criticism, that its function is 
fundamentally negative, limiting -- and blind. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Johnson's most devastating and immortal observation is that it is within 
the capacity of anyone to do nothing, a fact as true of the 18th Century as it 
is the 20th. How easy it is to speak of the worthlessness of a project, how the 
money might be spent on some present need, how there must be better ways to do 
things, how we have more immediate concerns. It is the sort of vision that 
condemns a society to its present forever instead of leading it to the future 
within its grasp. 
</P>
<P>
It came home to me, watching A&amp;E that night, that the do-nothings have 
almost won. Watching the tapes of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, it came home 
very powerfully indeed that we had wasted 20 complete years. Scarcely had the 
astronauts returned when NASA's funding was slashed, then slashed again. And 
why? To help the poor, of course. "A nation that could go to the moon," carped 
those on the political left who never had any use for Apollo except as a 
counterpoint for their own arguments, could just as easily take all that money 
and solve America's crushing social problems. 
</P>
<P>
Well, they've had their 20 years to solve their social problems. Vast mountains 
of funds have been disposed of, whole new bureaucracies created -- and those 
who made it all happen now say that the problem is worse than ever, that we 
still cannot afford a space program,that a nation that has gone to the moon can 
and ought to solve its social problems first. 
</P>
<P>
It was this sort of vision that made Portugal a world power. 
</P>
<P>
Any decent cynic could observe that if the problems are not solved, then the 
ability of the social reformers to do so is seriously in doubt. An indecent 
critic might say that the War on Poverty was fought with the same skill as that 
other war given us by the Johnson Administration. In either case, deducting a 
few percentage points from 20 years' worth of programs would manifestly have 
had no effect on the unsolved problems at all. 
</P>
<P>
But it would have given America something that the Soviet Union has -- a 
permanent space station where real people could do real work. What might have 
come from such a facility? Who can say? You have to go there to find out. 
</P>
<P>
Exploration is part and parcel of American history. It is said that we ought 
not to go forward with a major space program without assistance from our 
allies. Lewis and Clark, the first great American explorers, traveled a land in 
which our European friends had little interest -- the purchase itself had its 
detractors, of course; one wonders if some of those who opposed the Louisiana 
Purchase had heard Dr. Johnson's dictum firsthand -- and along the way they 
discovered about a third of what we now call America. The bread we eat comes 
from the region that was once called the Great American Desert. Now we call it 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
Doubtless there were pressing social problems at the time, but it is 
instructive that those problems are now the subject of dry history, while the 
subject of the purchase and exploration are a living part of our country. 
</P>
<P>
It is a fact of history that those who press outward always bring home 
discoveries that are useful. In simple business terms, investment in the future 
pays better than investment in the past. It is similarly true that you go to 
strange regions not for what you know is there, but for what you do not know. 
That's why it's called exploration. And only people can do that, because only 
people can look about and truly see things. Machines cannot. Exploration means 
people. 
</P>
<P>
The one advantage in exploration that did not exist so much in earlier times is 
that getting there really is half the fun. The space program is the future. It 
really is that simple. The poor may always be with us. Certainly the naysayers 
will. And the future will come whether we like it or not. The question is 
whether or not we will be there to meet and make it. The naysayers have had 
their 20 years, have spent their mountains of funds and have produced slim 
results by their own admission. Isn't it time to give somebody else a chance?
