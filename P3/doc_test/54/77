Vehicles: A Model Capsule Built To Withstand Atmospheric Heat"] 
  [Text] Construction of the Community's Ariane 
super-launcher continues, as does the preparation of the first 
vehicles destined to service the international orbital station, 
R-Alpha, from the year 2001. 
  On its very first flight, scheduled for the Spring of 1996, 
the ESA's [European Space Agency's] future Ariane 5 rocket 
should be launching an automated space capsule foreshadowing 
those which Europe intends to use at the beginning of the next 
century to put its astronauts into space. Presented yesterday 
by representatives of Aerospatiale's "Space Defense" division, 
this project, called "ARD" [Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator], 
will be a very important technological step towards European 
manned flight autonomy. It will in fact make it possible to 
test the various types of material which could be used to make 
the future capsule's heat shield, as well as the guidance 
systems which will give considerably improved landing accuracy 
compared to earlier space vehicles of this type. 
<H5>  Distance From Ground is 1,200 Kilometers </H5>
  While Ariane 5 is slowly taking shape at Les Mureaux, near 
Paris, where Aerospatiale is starting to build the first flight 
model (the first one should take off in the Fall of 1995), the 
engineers feel that the future of this heavy launch vehicle must 
be prepared for right now, particularly with respect to the 
manned flights which its reliability rating, "boosted" to more 
than 99 percent (whereas current versions of the European 
launcher only achieve 95 percent), will render possible. 
  It is in order to prepare for a new activity, as far as 
Europe is concerned, that Aerospatiale has just launched the ARD 
project: costing in the order of 200 million French francs [Fr], 
it will consist of the production, in just over two years, of an 
Apollo-type space capsule weighing 2,800 kilograms. "It is our 
understanding of the technologies connected with ballistic 
reentry and our skills in the technical management of large 
space systems which will allow us to carry out this program in 
such a short time," explains Bernard Humbert, who is in charge 
of "manned flight" activities at Aerospatiale. 
  Of course, this ARD capsule will only be an unmanned 
prototype. However, its already respectable size will bring it 
very close to the future "CTV" [Crew Transport Vehicle] which 
the ESA is thinking of using from 2001 onwards to service the 
international "R-Alpha" orbiting station: with a diameter of 2.8 
meters and a height of 2.4 meters, the ARD will be roughly as 
big as the Soyuz reentry module. 
  Developed with the participation of the Franco-British 
company Matra Marconi Space with respect to the functional 
electronics, and of German and Italian manufacturers 
(essentially Dasa and Alenia), the ARD capsule will make a 
suborbital flight lasting around 90 minutes. Although 
relatively short, it will nonetheless allow Europe to test all 
of the phases of a genuine mission to service an orbiting 
station: after taking off from the Kourou space center in 
Guyana, carried high in the nose cone of Ariane 5 (above a 
telecommunications satellite which the rocket will put into 
geostationary orbit during the same flight), the capsule will be 
released into space over the southern tip of Africa, immediately 
after extinction of the engine of its launch vehicle's central 
stage. Propelled by the thrust effect from the latter, it will 
climb to about 1,200 kilometers from ground level, far higher 
than the 350 to 400 kilometers currently achieved by the Russian 
Soyuz capsules when servicing the Mir station. The ARD will 
then fall towards the Pacific Ocean, where it will splash down 
some distance from the Chilean coast. 
<H5>  Protective Shield </H5>
  For the engineers, the main lessons should be learned during 
the fifteen or so minutes when the capsule is reentering the 
atmosphere. The main aims of the flight will then be twofold, 
concerning on the one hand the way the capsule itself "holds 
up," and on the other hand the accuracy achieved in guiding it 
towards the scheduled splashdown point. 
  As far as its ruggedness is concerned, it is planned to 
carry 
out a detailed analysis of the aerothermal phenomena which occur 
during the crucial phase of reentry into the upper layers of the 
atmosphere, as well as of the effects of the notorious radio 
"blackout" to which the vehicle, which will have an aluminum 
structure, will be subject, and, of course, the effectiveness of 
the protective shield, which will be made of a 
silicone-impregnated silica fabric, while the capsule's rear 
cone will be made of cork powder and phenolic resin. 
  With respect to the guidance system, it will be necessary to 
evaluate the behavior of the reentry propulsion system (derived 
from Ariane 5's attitude control system) as well as the 
effectiveness of the descent system used: it will consist of 
three parachutes measuring 16 meters in diameter which should be 
steered so as to produce a landing accurate to around one 
kilometer. This would be a distinct improvement over what has 
been done to date: while the return of the Apollos which 
conquered the Moon was achieved within a radius in the order of 
20 kilometers, the Soyuz cannot be guided with greater accuracy 
than around 10 kilometers... 
  If the operation is fully successful, a big step will have 
been taken towards the setting up of a real manned space 
transport system. On the condition, however, that the member 
countries of the ESA will first agree to supply the Fr20 billion 
or so which its realization will require. This program will in 
fact have to be the subject of a meeting of the European 
government ministers responsible for matters involving space, 
which is planned for the end of next year.
