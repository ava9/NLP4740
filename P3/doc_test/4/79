  [Text] Taiwan President Li Teng-hui went on a "holiday 
diplomacy" tour during the Spring Festival season. Under the 
pretext of "going on holiday," he took dozens of senior 
officials with him and visited three countries in Southeast 
Asia, namely, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand. Though 
all the host countries had cut diplomatic relations with Taiwan 
and established diplomatic relations with Beijing, and 
undertaken to adopt the "one China" policy, President Ramos, 
President Suharto, and King of Thailand Phumiphon went so far as 
to ignore Beijing's objection and insisted on meeting with Li 
Teng-hui, making Beijing very frustrated. According to informed 
sources in Beijing, in order to prevent the spread of Taipei's 
"holiday diplomacy," the CPC authorities have instructed 
relevant departments to work out countermeasures, which should 
include the review of its reunification tactics. 
<H3>  Li Kills Three Birds With One Stone by Carrying Out "Holiday 
Diplomacy" </H3>
  Informed sources said that a recent "restricted publication" 
circulating among high-ranking cadres ran a commentary on Li 
Teng- hui's "holiday diplomacy." This commentary believes that 
Li Teng- hui's "holiday diplomacy" is a materialization of 
Taiwan's "southward policy" (formulated to encourage Taiwan 
businessmen making investments in the mainland to channel their 
funds to Southeast Asia, in a bid to break the mainland's 
blockade with economy as an open sesame and expand Taiwan's 
diplomatic space) and an implementation of the "wild geese 
formation theory" (a Japanese economist's theory highly 
recommended by Li Teng-hui, which maps out an Asian economic 
scenario with Japan, the most advanced country, in the lead, 
followed by the "four little dragons" and then Southeast Asian 
countries, with the Chinese mainland and North Korea taking up 
the rear). To conduct "holiday diplomacy" toward Southeast Asia 
had been decided by the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee 
last December according to a motion made by Lien Chan, premier 
of the Executive Yuan, for a shift in diplomatic strategy. Lien 
Chan pointed out: South East Asian nations are now in need of 
money and technology, and Taiwan is capable of providing various 
kinds of assistance in this respect. "Taiwan has an exchange 
reserve of $80 billion. Can we not knock open the gate to 
Southeast Asia with it?" He argued that the time is ripe and 
Taiwan should not continue to give up what is within reach and 
seek after something unreachable, but should switch over from 
marching into Latin America to marching into Southeast Asia 
(countries surrounding China). Lien Chan not only put forward 
the motion, but also practiced it. He took the lead and went to 
Malaysia and Singapore to conduct "holiday diplomacy" toward the 
end of last year and at the beginning of this year, to open a 
way for Li Teng-hui and gain some experience. This effort made 
possible the instant success of Li Teng-hui's "holiday 
diplomacy" during the Spring Festival season, which fulfilled 
the purpose of "killing three birds with one stone:" It 
expanded headroom for Taiwan's diplomatic activities in the 
international arena, opened up new prospects for Taiwan business 
investment and development, and reduced Taiwan business 
dependence on the mainland market to prevent the increase of 
such dependence that might put Taiwan authorities in a passive 
position politically. 
<H5>  Host Countries Ignore China's Objection </H5>
  The sources continued: The CPC authorities showed grave 
concern over Li Teng-hui's "holiday diplomacy" from the very 
beginning. Before Li went on the "holiday," the Chinese foreign 
ministry spokesman said: Taiwan authorities are attempting to 
develop "substantive relations" with some countries on the 
pretense of "holiday-making," trying to create "two Chinas" in 
the international arena. The Chinese Government and the Chinese 
people are firmly against it and will never accept it. If the 
governments of the countries that have diplomatic relations with 
China accept Li Teng-hui's visit, regardless of the capacity and 
way in which this visit will be made, it will severely hurt the 
feelings of the Chinese people and impair the friendly and 
cooperative relations the countries concerned have maintained 
with China. Obviously, China hoped that the countries concerned 
would treasure their relations with China as their priority and 
guard against the political stratagem of the Taiwan authorities 
to avoid disrupting and damaging their friendly and cooperative 
relations with China that had been hard to come by. But the 
host countries ignored China's statement and went ahead to 
receive Li Teng-hui. 
  After Li went on his "holiday," the Chinese Foreign Ministry 
spokesman again said: "The so-called 'holiday' diplomacy of Li 
Teng-hui is in essence an attempt to practice `two Chinas' or 
`one China, one Taiwan.' Practicing `two Chinas' or 'one China, 
one Taiwan' is a violation of the fundamental interests of all 
Chinese people, including Taiwan compatriots, and is therefore 
doomed to failure. Countries that have diplomatic relations 
with China should strictly observe the principles of the 
communiques signed when such relations with China were 
established and the undertakings they made at the time. Any 
breach of the principle of diplomatic relations and the 
undertakings given at the time will naturally have a damaging 
effect on bilateral relations." 
  In the meantime, China canceled the arrangements for a 
National People's Congress delegation to visit the Philippines 
and Thailand, annulled an agreement on the import of timber from 
Indonesia, and froze the anti-tank weapons to be exported to 
Thailand. But the host countries turned a deaf ear and a blind 
eye to it. Moreover, THE NATION, an English language paper of 
Thailand which had enjoyed quite a good relationship with China, 
published a special article entitled "Risking the Danger of 
`Holiday Diplomacy'" on 20 February. The article pointed out: 
All Southeast Asian nations understand that reiterating the 
"one China policy" every evening may ensure a good night's 
sleep, but it does not give a "full stomach." The special 
article quoted a senior official of the Thai foreign ministry as 
saying that this is a "win-win" situation: Taiwan may declare 
to the world that it has conquered the last wall of the 
Southeast Asian nations, while Thailand may reap benefits from 
Taiwan investment. 
  The attitude of the host countries inspired Li Teng-hui. He 
was determined to carry on with "holiday diplomacy." Li has set 
the next targets of "holiday diplomacy" as India, Bangladesh, 
and Burma and then Japan and the United States. There are 
political personalities in both the United States and Japan 
saying that Li Teng-hui's "holiday diplomacy" is acceptable. In 
view of this, when he was visiting Japan in late February, 
Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji issued a warning in Tokyo: "The 
Taiwan issue is a very sensitive question between China and 
Japan. I believe the Japanese Government will observe the 
principle of the Sino-Japanese joint declaration and will never 
do anything that would hurt the feelings of the Chinese people." 
But how the future unfolds remains to be seen. 
  The sources also said: Because Li Teng-hui's "holiday 
diplomacy" came to the fore after Beijing took the initiative to 
give in and make it possible for the "Tang-Chiao meeting" to 
reach an understanding, the CPC finds itself in a state of 
attending to one thing while losing sight of another and feels 
that it has been misled by the "Tang-Chiao meeting." 
Furthermore, the three countries playing host to Li Teng-hui 
went so far as to go their own way and ignore Beijing's 
objection, which has deeply convinced the CPC authorities that 
they cannot change the predicament they are in if they fail to 
break "holiday diplomacy." Therefore, CPC authorities have 
instructed the relevant departments to work out a 
countermeasure. Some think tanks based in big cities, such as 
the Institute for International Strategic Studies, have recently 
recommended tactics for dealing with Li Teng-hui's "holiday 
diplomacy," including short-term and long-term actions. 
<H5>  Think Tanks Recommend Countermeasures </H5>
  The proposed short-term actions include the above-mentioned 
objections and cancellations of visits. 
  The long-term actions refer to the formulation of some 
proposals for dealing with Taiwan and Hong Kong [as published] 
and solving the problem thoroughly. 
  One of the proposals is to use military means to attain 
reunification. The provider of this proposal believes that 
Taiwan is a free trade zone with scarce resources and relies on 
importation for raw materials. Once a blockade is imposed at 
sea, Taiwan's economy will dry up within three months. The 
purpose of the blockade is to push Taiwan into talks with the 
mainland on reunification. If the talks are held when the 
blockade is imposed, the process of reunification can be greatly 
shortened. If this move is made after Hong Kong and Macao 
return to China, the reunification of the two sides may come 
true at the turn of century. Then one can say the 21th century 
will be the century of Chinese people! 
  The second proposal is: first economy, then politics; 
first nongovernmental contacts, then official contacts. 
The key point here is to create a situation in which Taiwan's 
economy depends on the mainland and its politics cannot avoid 
being swayed by it. 
  The third proposal is to take both political and 
military measures at the same time. That means 
strengthening dialogue in politics while looking for an 
opportunity in military sense (e.g. taking the island back if 
and when Taiwan declares independence). It is unwise to wait 
till the advanced weapons that the United States and France sell 
to Taiwan have arrived, otherwise it will be even more difficult. 
  Taiwan studies experts in Beijing pointed out: Though CPC 
authorities have so far adhered to the stand and principle of 
"one China, coexistence of two systems, high degree of autonomy, 
and peaceful reunification" on the Taiwan issue, they have never 
promised not to use force of arms. It is believed that the 
shock caused by Li Teng-hui's "holiday diplomacy" will spur the 
CPC to further review its new tactics for reunification. This 
is a noteworthy new development. Beijing, 2 March 1994
