  [Excerpts] Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan flew to 
Phuket yesterday for a "round of golf" with visiting Taiwanese 
President Li Teng-hui, who is due to arrive today on an 
controversial private visit, an official source said yesterday. 
  Li's private plane is due to touch down in Phuket about 11 
am 
from Bali, in Indonesia, an informed source said. Thailand is 
the third and last stop of Li's Southeast Asian tour--which has 
drawn protests and veiled threats from Beijing. He also visited 
the Philippines. 
  The Taiwanese president will stay at the Pacific Island Club 
Hotel, where Amnuai will host a dinner reception for him 
tonight, the source said. Deputy Labour and Social Welfare 
Minister Phaithun Kaeothong is also to meet Lee for talks about 
the Thai labour market in Taiwan. Amnuai and Phaithun are both 
members of the New Aspiration Party (NAP). 
  There are about 30,000 Thais working legally in Taiwan, and 
an estimated 40,000 working without permission. [passage omitted] 
  Li will spend tomorrow playing golf with senior Thai 
businessmen--Chatri Sophonphanit, of the Bangkok Bank, Uthen 
Techaphaibun, of the Bangkok Metropolitan Bank, Saman Ophatwong, 
a major rice exporter to Taiwan, and Wisit Wirasithom, owner of 
the Wall Street Tower--and go sightseeing at Pang-Nga Bay, the 
source said. Tomorrow night he will host a return dinner party 
for Amnuai and the businessmen at the Sheraton Hotel. [passage 
omitted] 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and Foreign Minister Prasong 
Sunsiri have stressed the govemment's adherence to a one-China 
policy. However they also said senior people from Thailand's 
economic partners, such as Taiwan have a right to make private 
visits. 
  Chuan, unlike Ramos and Suharto, has refused to receive Li 
during his three-day visit. [passage omitted]
