  [Text] Taipei, March 22 KYODO -- A nonpartisan group of 
eight Japanese parliamentarians arrived in Taipei on Tuesday [22 
March] over an issue of some 452.4 million yen of unsettled 
government bonds bought by Taiwanese before and during World War 
II. 
  The Japanese Diet members said they will hold negotiations 
with 18 Taiwanese counterparts headed by Liu Sung-pan, head of 
the National Assembly, on the issue. 
  They said during their stay in Taiwan, they will also meet 
Taiwanese president Li Teng-hui. 
  The group of eight comprises two opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) parliamentarians and one each from five 
governing parties -- the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] 
(SDP) [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party], Komeito and new party Sakigake -- as well 
as one independent. 
  It is the first time for a Japanese Diet group including an 
SDPJ parliamentarian to visit Taiwan for the purpose of 
negotiations since Japan broke its diplomatic relations with the 
island country in 1972. The SDPJ has traditionally backed 
Mainland China since even before 1972. 
  Japan has voiced its intention to refund the unpaid money to 
the Taiwanese from the fiscal 1995 state budget beginning in 
April 1995. 
  Wartime Japanese rulers in Taiwan forced people to deposit 
part of their monthly salaries into postal savings accounts. 
  Many Taiwanese hope to link the unpaid money to indexing, 
saying the value has risen by about 4,500 times from 1943 on the 
basis of Japanese public servant salaries. 
  According to a Japanese Government estimate, the postal 
savings deposits and other unpaid money totaled 452.4 million 
yen owned by about 2,547,000 people. 
  Of the 452.4 million yen, postal savings account for 369 
million yen, postal annuities 1.4 million yen and unpaid 
salaries 82 million yen, according to the estimate. 
  The savings will be recognized as a fixed amount with high 
interest, the sources said. 
  The issue is to be handled the same way the government 
repaid 
the savings of Okinawa residents deposited before the war, the 
sources said. 
  From December 1969 to February 1972, just before the 
reversion of Okinawa to Japan from the United States, the 
government reimbursed 94 million yen in savings to residents, 
adding 339 million yen to the principal as indexing. 
  Japan occupied Taiwan from 1885 to 1945. Before and during 
the war, Japan encouraged the purchase of government bonds not 
only in Japan but also in its former colonies of Korea and 
Taiwan.
