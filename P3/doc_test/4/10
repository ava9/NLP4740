  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday hit back 
at China for having rapped Bangkok over a private visit by 
Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui, saying the president was not a 
persona non grata and had every right to enter Thailand. 
"Everybody who is not persona non grata has the right to enter 
Thailand, just as the Dalai Lama has done," Chuan said his 
strongest statement yet on the Taiwanese president's visit. 
[passage omitted] 
  The prime minister said there was no agreement between 
Thailand and China to bar an unofficial visit by a Taiwanese 
president. 
  Chuan said that although Thailand holds a one-China policy 
and has no diplomatic ties with Taiwan, Bangkok has the right to 
negotiate with the island state over trade, economic and labour 
issues. "As I have said, Thailand has a one-China policy. But 
if any people like to travel to Thailand on the invitation of 
the private sector, he or she can do so. Thailand and Taiwan 
have trade ties, and Taiwanese businessmen are the third largest 
investors here, second to Japan and the United States. We give 
priority to economic ties with both Taiwan and China. Taiwan has 
more investment in Thailand than China does," Chuan said. 
  The prime minister said Li did not come to Thailand to 
discuss diplomatic or political ties, and had not met him or 
Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri. [passage omitted] Chuan said 
leaders of the two other Asean countries had provided reception 
to Li, but the Thai prime minister had not. "So, (China) should 
understand how we treat the China policy," Chuan said. 
  Prasong said yesterday that Li's unofficial trip to Thailand 
was just a "private" visit and the Chinese Ambassador in Bangkok 
would be invited for talks to clear up any misunderstanding. 
"The president's visit was very much a personal affair. The 
Thai government still holds a one-China policy," Prasong 
insisted. If China still did not understand the point, he was 
ready to explain it personally to the Chinese Ambassador. 
Prasong reiterated that Thailand did not intend to change its 
China policy. 
  He denied that the meeting between Deputy Prime minister and 
Li Teng-hui was official, adding that the two did not discuss 
politics or economics. "Amnuai went to see President Li in a 
personal capacity, not as deputy prime minister," Prasong said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Asked whether the visit would jeopardize progress in the 
Economic Quadrangle -- a multi-lateral development between 
China, Thailand, Laos, and Burma -- as charged by the opposition 
Prasong said the two subjects could not be linked. "It means the 
opposition doesn't know any thing about the Economic 
Quadrangle," he said, without elaborating. [passage omitted] 
  The House Speaker, Marut Bunnak denied he had discussed 
politics during a luncheon he hosted for the president at the 
Central Plaza Hotel on Wednesday. "I have been in Taiwan and was 
warmly welcomed. So I just wanted to show my hospitality in 
return. This is just Thai tradition," Marut said.
