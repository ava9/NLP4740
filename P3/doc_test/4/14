Expedient judgments are at core of support for a dissent-ridden party that

WHEN Taiwan votes tomorrow in the most significant election of its 43-year
history, the result will already be certain.
But it could be a hollow victory for President Lee Teng-hui's ruling
Kuomintang party, as the election campaign shows growing dissension and
alleged corruption within his once authoritarian party.
The KMT has almost two official candidates for each of the 161 seats in the
parliament but these have been joined by 43 maverick KMT representatives who
are running without its official endorsement and are distorting the official
party line.
Even among the official candidates, there is such a broad spectrum of
forceful opinion that the KMT begins to resemble a loose alliance of vested
interests, united only in their desire to retain the patronage of a powerful
corporate and political empire.
This will make for more tempestuous government. President Lee should emerge
from the elections with core control of a ruling party which more fully
reflects the views of the Taiwanese people; but he will have to be prepared
to make concessions to pass its programme of economic and political reforms.
It is only the second time the entire parliament - which approves
legislation and the make-up of the cabinet - has been elected.
The first was in 1949, and it was only last year that the vestiges of its
'old thieves' - the surviving octogenarians who had rubber-stamped
government legislation for 40 years - were at last removed.
Convoys of colourful vans fill the streets, voicing the slogans of the two
main parties, the KMT and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, along
with an assortment of independents ranging from a recently-jailed business
tycoon to a woman who bares her breasts for democracy.
A further incentive will come in the NTDollars 10bn (Pounds 250m) that is
expected to come out of the banking system to reimburse many of the 10m
voters who turn out on Saturday. Corruption will be a key factor.
One senior businessman said: 'Some politicians are spending NTDollars 500m
on buying their candidacy.' There have been 96 investigations into
vote-buying.
The KMT has the support of notable 'golden oxen' - rich businessmen who are
keen to exert political influence - to add to the earnings from its
corporate empire; this gives it a massive advantage. In addition, it holds
key cards, such as ownership of television stations and newspapers.
But the DPP is still expected to pick up more than 30 per cent of the vote,
while independent candidates could win another 15 per cent. This should put
across a clear message to Mr Lee: the public is tiring of money politics.
Mr Ting Tin-yu, chief consultant to Gallup in Taiwan, said: 'The phenomenon
of this election is that there will be a lot of angry voters. I think the
whole KMT will suffer from this, and their vote will fall below 60 per
cent'.
This is 10 per cent below the KMT's rating at last year's elections for the
national assembly, which amends the constitution and chooses the president.
The KMT was aided last year by the DPP's call for Taiwan's independence from
mainland China, which proved unpopular. A hotel worker said: 'If the KMT win
the election, the mainland Chinese will not be angry. If the DPP win the
election, I think the mainland will invade.'
The DPP has toned down its rhetoric with its new slogan 'One China, One
Taiwan'. It is scarcely a retraction, but a recent poll found more than 40
per cent of respondents did not believe it meant independence. The DPP also
gains strength from the fact that it has not put forward enough candidates
to control the government, but will only be able to impose checks and
balances on the KMT.
This is important, since they still lack credibility. Policies such as
lowering taxes but introducing a welfare state have unnerved economists and
the party retains its image of being warlike.
Legislative brawls have become less frequent than they were, but several DPP
candidates were arrested last week, one of whom allegedly tried to break
into the local KMT headquarters with a tank of gasoline and two torches.
Probably of greater concern to President Lee, however, is the opposition
coming from within his own party. At the liberal end of the KMT spectrum,
there are legislators with views identical to those of the DPP. At the
conservative end there remains the shadow of the mainland.
Chiang Kai-shek's nationalists and their direct descendants account for only
15 per cent of the population, but since they arrived on the island in 1949,
they have controlled its politics.
So far, they have partly withstood a backlash from the native Taiwanese. Mr
Lee's 'mainstream' faction (which is more reformist and pro-business) is now
primarily Taiwanese-born; with enough support from the electorate, it is
keen to purge the cabinet of many of its controlling mainlanders.
But the mainlanders will remain a powerful force. Two former cabinet
members, Mr Jaw Shao-kang and Mr Wang Chien-hsien, put themselves forward as
unofficial KMT candidates, and have run a successful campaign on an
anti-corruption banner.
They appear certain to be elected and to be a source of dissent in President
Lee's parliament. He will therefore have to proceed with caution in
implementing his reform programme, and also in any changes in policy towards
China.
