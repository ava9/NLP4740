  [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday 
emphasised that Taiwan's President Li Teng-hui would be paying a 
private visit to Thailand that carried no official endorsement 
from the Government. President Li, who was reported to have 
left the Philippines for Indonesia yesterday, is expected to 
arrive in Thailand on Monday on the last leg of a regional tour 
that Beijing strongly opposes. 
  Squadron Leader Prasong said the Taiwanese president 
arranged 
the trip to Thailand through the private sector and that there 
were no plans for him to meet Prime Minister Chuan Likphai or 
other Cabinet ministers. The Foreign Minister reaffirmed 
Bangkok's one-China policy but he pointed out that this did not 
exclude economic relations. Thailand and Taiwan are co-members 
of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong made the points after meeting China's 
Ambassador-designate Jing Guihua, who made a second trip to the 
Foreign Ministry yesterday, to make sure that the Foreign 
Minister had received Peking's protest note. 
  The envoy had delivered Peking's protest to Permanent 
Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pracha Khunakasem on Tuesday, when 
the Foreign Minister was absent. 
  The envoy presented his credentials to His Majesty the King 
yesterday afternoon, after meeting Sqn Ldr Prasong. 
  "I informed him [the Chinese envoy] that the Thai Government 
did not issue the invitation, and that the Foreign Ministry had 
received no communication on the matter," Sqn Ldr Prasong sald. 
  "They [the Taiwanese] contacted the private sector," he 
said. 
Thailand broke off diplomatic relations with Taiwan when it 
normalised relations with China on July 1, 1975. 
  "We respect the agreement and we have a one-China policy," 
Sqn Ldr Prasong said. Thailand did not intervene in the 
political problems between China and Taiwan which were "their 
internal affair". But economic relations were a different 
matter, especially when Thailand and Taiwan were co-members of 
APEC. Exchanges of visits for talks on economics and trade were 
"possible". 
  China is also a member of the 15-nation grouping, which 
rallies all six member states of the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) and their main trading partners. In a 
statement issued on Monday, Beijing warned regional states of 
possible damage to "friendly relations" between them and China 
if they endorse "in whatever name or form" Mr Li's visits. 
  Taiwan is a major investor in the region. According to 
informed sources, the Taiwanese president is accompanied by 
First Lady Cheng Wen-hui. Foreign Minister Fredrick Chien, 
economic planning agency chief Vincent Siew, deputy secretary to 
the president Tai Jui-ming and Nationalist Party 
secretary-general Hsu Hsui-teh. 
  Chinese President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin is 
reported to be planning visits to Thailand and other ASEAN 
member states in the second half of this year.
