TAIWAN has approved a series of measures to increase ties with mainland
China, but these are likely to be criticised by the island's business
leaders as too cautious.
Following a two-day government conference organised by Taiwan's Mainland
Affairs Council, which oversees relations with China, the measures will now
go to Taiwan's cabinet and are expected to be quickly approved.
Under the proposals, Taiwanese banks will be allowed for the first time to
deal with Chinese banks, but only through overseas offices. Taiwanese
financial institutions will also be allowed to conduct certain transactions
with the branches of foreign banks in China. Taiwanese businessmen will be
allowed to remit money from China to Taiwan, and Taiwan has further relaxed
its rules on imports from the mainland.
The moves are the latest step in Taiwan's gradual programme to increase ties
with China. But Taiwan again refused demands from business that direct
shipping and air links be established. Taiwan's bans on direct trade,
transport and postal links, known as the 'three tongs', are seen as
important negotiating tools to try to force China to renounce its threat to
use force against Taiwan.
Taiwanese companies have invested about Dollars 3.6bn (Pounds 2bn) in China
since they were first allowed to set up operations, via third countries, in
1987. Processing and labour-intensive industries have moved to China to
avoid high wage and land costs on the island. So far few big companies have
invested in the mainland, but most analysts agree investment would increase
sharply if direct ties were established. Taiwan's government fears this
could undermine the island's economy.
Mr Lin Yu-siang, a legislator opposed to closer Chinese ties at this stage,
said direct links could lead 'most Taiwanese factories' to move to China.
'This is a security issue and would lead to serious unemployment,' he said.
