<F P=106> [Editorial: "Watch Out for Li Teng-Hui's Words and Deeds </F>
About `Taiwan Independence'"] 
  [Text] In a lengthy talk with Japanese writer Ryotaro Shiba 
(Terukazu Fukuda) in March this year, Li Teng-hui expressed many 
views unheard before. The most conspicuous ones are: First, 
the Kuomintang is a "immigrant political power," and second, 
"the term `China' is ambiguous." In addition he repeatedly 
stressed the grief of the Taiwan people. These remarks would 
not be surprising if they had been made by one advocating Taiwan 
independence, but they were made by none other than Li Teng-hui, 
the Kuomintang chairman and Taiwan's supreme leader, to a 
Japanese writer who stubbornly adheres to a militarist stand, so 
they cannot but arouse great public concern. 
  Though their conversation was casual, its theme was quite 
clear: Li tried to deny the existence of China and that Taiwan 
is a part of China. He even went so far as to consider himself 
a "Moses" who will deliver the Taiwan people "from Egypt." What 
he implied was understood. Since Li is Taiwan's supreme leader, 
with real power in his hands, if his political and historical 
philosophy were to be put into practice, it would bring disaster 
to Taiwan. 
  Li made a glaring mistake in logic and in practice by 
describing the Kuomintang as an "immigrant political power," as 
he himself is Kuomintang chairman, as well as Taiwan's 
president. He was elected by the "national congress," which 
together with Kuomintang moved to Taiwan from the mainland in 
1949, and he was promoted as "vice president" by Chiang 
Ching-kuo after he had served the "immigrant political power" 
for many years. Li described the Kuomintang as an "immigrant 
political power" in order to deny the rationality of the 
political power. By doing so, however, he debased his own power 
and denied the rationality of the Taiwan authorities. This 
might be a reason why principal media in Taiwan did not report 
the interview. 
  His attempt to deny the existence of China is both 
ridiculous 
and lamentable. The concept of China or the Chinese nation is 
clearly defined, which no clown like Ryotaro Shiba can deny. In 
the early period of this century, China suffered from domestic 
trouble and foreign invasion, including the invasion of Taiwan 
by Japanese militarists, but all this is gone, never to return. 
China now is marching toward modernization, and no one can 
prevent its rise from oblivion. China is now an important, 
widely respected member of the international community, and the 
Chinese nation never has been so united as it is today. The 
attempt by a few people who alienate themselves from the Chinese 
nation, forget their own origins, and sing a duet with those 
disgraceful foreigners who are trying to bring imperialism back 
to life can be compared only to a mayfly trying to shake against 
a giant tree. They ridiculously overrate themselves. 
  The conversation reflected Li's gloomy ideas in his heart of 
hearts. It absolutely was no accident that he chose Ryotaro 
Shiba as his partner in conversation, nor was it that he 
repeatedly beautified the Japanese invaders' rule over Taiwan. 
He impudently alleged that "Taiwan independence" would lead to 
"Tibet and Xinjiang independence," "making it very difficult for 
Beijing to establish a greater Asia Chinese nation [da zhong hua 
min zu ya zhou 1129 0022 5478 3046 2469 0068 3166]." For the 
leader of the Taiwan authorities to express such a view cannot 
but arouse great concern among the people on both sides of the 
Taiwan Straits. Since the end of the Cold War, civil war has 
broken out in a number of countries, such as Bosnia-Hercegovina 
in Europe, Georgia in the Near East, and most recently in Yemen. 
The international community is loath to see such turbulence 
because it can only plunge the people into misery and suffering, 
and endanger regional security. This also teaches the people of 
other countries how social security and territorial integrity 
are important to them. The area of Taiwan is only 35,000 square 
meters and its economy is of a sea-island type. Taiwan's 
current economic and social situations have not come easily. It 
is extremely irresponsible for a person in power to separate 
Taiwan from the mainland because such an act is against the 
interests of the Chinese nation, including the Taiwan people, 
and against the current trend of peace and development. 
  If the person in power resorts to the former colonialist and 
foreign forces in trying to split the country, he will drag 
Taiwan into an abyss and stand condemned through the ages. 
People on both sides of the Taiwan Straits must maintain high 
vigilance.
