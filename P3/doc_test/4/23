  [Text] Jakarta, Feb 9 (OANA-ANTARA) -- The visit by Taiwan 
President Li Teng-hui to Indonesia will in no way change 
Indonesia's line of one china policy, said Foreign Ministers Ali 
Alatas. "President Li Teng-hui's visit will not change a bit of 
our policy of one China. We retain the line," he said here on 
Tuesday. 
  He was commenting on the protests forwarded by Beijing and 
circles concerned here on a planned meeting between Taiwan 
President Li Teng-hui and President Suharto in Bali later this 
week. The circles expressed their concern that such a meeting 
could destabilize the relations between Indonesia and China. 
  "Li Teng-hui's visit to Bali is only an informal one. He is 
on vacation in Bali. There is nothing deviated from Indonesia's 
stance on having only trade relations with Taiwan," he said. 
  He noted that there is no need for the public to worry that 
Indonesia will change its one China policy. "Foreign Ministry 
has given necessary explanation to Chinese ambassador here and 
our staffs in Beijing did so to the Chinese Government. There is 
no need to exagerate such a meeting as both leaders will meet in 
their own personal capacity. Li's meeting with Minister of 
Research and Technology B.J. Habibie is also a kind of two 
scientists' meeting," he said. 
  Asked about the possibility of Taiwan's presence in APEC 
leaders' informal meeting here next November, Alatas said that 
the procedure of organizing the summit meeting of APEC leaders 
will be the same as that of in Seattle, the United States, last 
November. "Jakarta's meeting next November will be the same as 
that of one in Seattle. It'll be still a informal one. Hong 
Kong and Taiwan will be represented by their ministers, he said.
