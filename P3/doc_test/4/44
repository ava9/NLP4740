Sicharatchanya: "Towards a New and Independent Taiwan State 
(Separate from China)"] 
  [Excerpts] Taiwan President Li Teng-hui pulled off an 
unusual sort of diplomatic coup last week after completing his 
three-nation swing through Southeast Asia. For a 
self-proclaimed island republic that has been isolated in the 
international community as a result of China's increasing 
influence on the world stage, Mr. Li's `holiday' diplomacy 
appears to have worked. 
  Despite vocal protests from Peking even before he left 
Taipei, the Taiwanese president managed to secure informal 
meetings with Indonesian President Suharto and Philippine 
President Fidel Ramos. Although he did not meet Thai Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai as earlier expected, Mr. Li sought and 
was granted a symbolically significant private audience with His 
Majesty the King in Bangkok. 
  The diplomatic controversy kicked up by Mr. Li's Thai visit 
did not come as a surprise -- treating Taiwan like a renegade 
province within the jurisdiction of its empire as it does, 
Peking would have been remiss of its responsibility if it had 
not protested against the Thai government. Likewise, the 
ensuing debates between senior Thai officials and opposition 
politicians over the pros and cons of Mr. Li's `vacation' were 
also expected. 
  Critics who warned of negative diplomatic and economic 
ramifications from lncurring the wrath of China might have a 
valid point in drawing the distinction between the Dalai Lama's 
visit here last year and Mr. Li's trip. Whereas Thailand scored 
some plus points among Western nations from hosting the Dalai 
Lama, there was virtually no diplomatic asset from hosting Mr. 
Li this time, not to mention the bruised feelings between 
Bangkok and Peking. 
  But taking the pessimistic view -- as senior Opposition 
Leader and Former Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan did -- that 
China might withdraw from (its participation in) the 
often-trumpeted Economic Quadrangle out of resentment over Mr. 
Li's visit has come across as being too farfetched. The 
Quadrangle scheme envisages bringing development -- a 
combination of trade, tourism, and investments -- to otherwise 
backward and land-locked areas of southern China, parts of 
Burma, Laos, and northern Thailand. If China chooses to deny its 
own territory of such development, then it is too bad. [passage 
omitted] 
  The potential negative repercussions aside, it was 
understandable why the Thai authorities had unofficially 
welcomed Mr. Li. Since Thailand broke off diplomatic relations 
with Taipei and switched to recognise Peking nearly 20 years 
ago, this country had not only kept up but also expanded its 
bilateral economic ties with Taiwan. [passage omitted] 
  The favourable assimilation between ethnic Chinese and Thais 
here is definitely more conducive to further growth in Taiwanese 
investments than certain other ASEAN countries where racial 
differences run deep. This is not to mention the prospect of 
legitimising the estimated 50,000 Thai workers in Taiwan and 
sending more workers there. 
  On balance, the immediate gains for Thailand from hosting 
Mr. 
Li appears to outweigh the potential adverse repercussions from 
upsetting Peking. And in retrospect, our conduct of an 
independent foreign policy would have been cast in a poor light 
if we had kowtowed to Chinese pressures in denying Mr. Li's 
visit. 
  This does not mean to say that the policy of unofficially 
accommodating Taiwan should remain static. Bilateral 
Thai-Chinese interests could well develop to such a dominant 
extent in the future that warrants pushing Taiwan to the 
sideline. In the meantime, it is the Foreign Ministry's 
responsibility to minimise whatever damage caused with China.
