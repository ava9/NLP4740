Taiwan yesterday announced a cabinet reshuffle in which the most significant
move was seen as shifting emphasis from politics to economics in delicate
relations with China.
The moves were also seen as an effort by President Lee Teng-hui to
strengthen his position in advance of presidential elections slated for
early 1996 and subtly to raise Taiwan's level of representation at
international economic meetings. The last big cabinet reshuffle took place
in early 1993.
Mr Vincent Siew, economic planning minister, will head the Mainland Affairs
Council, the agency which shapes China policy. Mr Siew has advocated opening
direct shipping and air links with China, long banned by the ruling
Nationalist party but supported by Taiwanese business interests.
His successor as chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development will be Mr Hsu Li-teh, who will remain deputy premier.
Mr Hsu will represent Taiwan at next year's Asia Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum. President Lee is barred by China's objections from
attending the annual trade summit of the region's leaders. China views
Taiwan as a rebel-held province and thwarts its attempts to join
international organisations.
On Tuesday, Mr Siew said Taiwan should consider setting up 'offshore'
shipping centres through which direct sea trade with China could be
conducted. 'We should actively review the current indirect trade and
investment policy and make some appropriate relaxations. . . under
conditions of national security, we should consider setting up a shipping
centre outside national boundaries,' he said.
All cross-strait trade must now by law be routed through a third location
such as Hong Kong. Earlier, similar proposals have suggested that one of
Taiwan's harbours be designated as the centre for direct shipping with
China.
However, Mr Siew cautioned yesterday against reading too much into his
appointment. 'I will not only focus on economic issues and there will be no
major policy change. . . don't expect too much from me,' he was quoted as
saying.
