Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui has accepted an invitation from the
organisers of the Asian Games to attend the event next month in Hiroshima,
in a move which will embarrass the Japanese government and anger China.
China insists it will boycott the region's premier sporting event if Mr Lee
is permitted to attend. China regards Taiwan as a rebellious province and Mr
Lee as its illegitimate leader.
Mr Raymond Tai, presidential spokesman, told a press conference in Taipei
yesterday that Mr Lee had accepted the invitation from Kuwait's Sheikh Ahmad
al-Fahad, president of the Olympic Council of Asia, in order to 'promote
world peace and harmony'. More than 7,000 athletes from 42 countries and
territories are due to compete in the games from October 2 to 16.
Taiwan's foreign ministry meanwhile issued a statement saying that Mr Lee's
acceptance had 'nothing to do with relations between the Republic of China
and Japan' and that the president merely wished to attend the event.
Tensions have been escalating over the matter for the last month. On Tuesday
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minister, said Mr Lee's visit to Japan
'may be difficult to realise'.
The absence of Chinese athletes, considered the best in the region, would be
a severe blow to the success of the games. Granting Mr Lee permission to
alight on Japanese soil, even as an ordinary tourist rather than as a head
of state, could also provoke diplomatic repercussions.
Japan switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1972,
officially affirming Beijing's claim that Taiwan is a part of China.
Taiwan has threatened to boycott the games if Japan prevents Mr Lee from
travelling to Hiroshima. 'We don't rule out the possibility of boycotting
the games if our national dignity suffers a serious blow,' said Mr Chang
Feng-shu, chairman of Taiwan's Olympic Committee.
Taiwanese legislators have urged Japan to allow Mr Lee to attend, arguing
that politics should not interfere with sport.
