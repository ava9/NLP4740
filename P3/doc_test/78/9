  [Text] Sofia, May 13 (BTA) -- Today Prime Minister Lyuben 
Berov filed with the Secretarial Department of the National 
Assembly the cabinet's programme of intent concerning the 
structural and personnel cabinet changes. The MP's may be 
expected to discuss the programme next week. 
  Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov is very likely to take 
office as one of the deputy prime ministers, Prof. Berov told 
reporters in parliament. He denied that the post of deputy 
prime minister had been ever offered to Prof. Todor Vulchev, 
governor of the Bulgarian National Bank. The negotiations are 
still going on, the prime minister said, adding there would be 
no meetings with representatives of the parliamentary groups 
today. 
  This week Prime Minister Berov held consultations with the 
parliamentary groups of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights 
and Freedoms (DPS), whose mandate he used to form a cabinet at 
the end of 1992, and with the parliamentary Bulgarian Socialist 
Party (BSP), which supports the government. The DPS had 
parallel talks with the New Union for Democracy (NSD), a 
parliamentary group set up by expelees and breakaways from the 
Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), and with the Civil Alliance 
for the Republic, which unites the MP's who split from the BSP 
parliamentary group. 
  After his yesterday's [12 May] meeting with Prof. Berov, BSP 
leader Zhan Videnov said that the new project for cabinet 
changes was better than the first one. Yesterday DPS leader 
Ahmed Dogan said he had stressed at a meeting with Prime 
Minister Berov that the DPS wanted the formula of expert 
government be reckoned with when carrying out the cabinet 
changes. On Wednesday [11 May] the parliamentary SDS moved for 
a vote of no confidence in the government. At an extraordinary 
meeting today, the NSD MP's considered the prime minister's 
programme for changes and revised their initial position on not 
taking part in any negotiations on the cabinet's overhaul. The 
NSD revising its position made NSD co-chairperson Stefan 
Bozhilov resign as a leader of that parliamentary group.
