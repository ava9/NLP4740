  [Text] Sofia, April 12 (BTA) -- The leader of the 
opposition Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) Filip Dimitrov 
almost does not rely on parliamentary methods to oust Prof. 
Lyuben Berov's government from power and provoke early 
parliamentary elections. SDS wants the fall of Prof. Berov's 
cabinet, which was formed in late December 1992 on the mandate 
of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms and with 
the support of the ex-communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), 
the New Union for Democracy (expellees or defectors from the 
parliamentary SDS) and several independent MP's. After the 
regular meeting of SDS's leadership today, the union's floor 
leader Stefan Savov categorically denied that when he met with 
President Zhelyu Zhelev yesterday they discussed Mr. Savov's 
possible candidature to head a future cabinet. The union 
insists on early elections. Stefan Sofiyanski, a deputy 
chairman of SDS's National Coordinating Council, said the union 
was not going to abandon the parliamentary methods in order to 
provoke elections. In his view, SDS will insist that the 
National Assembly debate and vote a resolution on the cabinet's 
financial policy which, according to the opposition, has been 
the cause for the steep appreciation of the U.S. dollar and the 
rise of prices over the last few months. It will be only after 
the National Assembly adopts such a resolution that SDS might 
move its sixth vote of no confidence in the cabinet after its 
previous ones were defeated. 
  The BSP will keep up its pressure on the government, 
demanding practical measures to get inflation under control and 
speed up the efforts to offset the erosion of the incomes of the 
socially disadvantaged, Mr. Doncho Konakchiev MP of the BSP told 
a news conference today. This is the decision taken at today's 
meeting of the Socialists' leadership. The Socialists intend to 
celebrate the International Labour Day on May 1 by "raising 
slogans with demands for better social policy," for a crack-down 
on profiteering and corruption, for taking practical measures to 
solve the problems of the socially disadvantaged and for 
economic stability", Mr. Konakchiev said. 
  The Socialists confirmed today the decision of their plenum 
ten days ago to demand that the cabinet present in mid-May a 
reasoned progress report and ideas of its economic policy. 
According to the Socialists, the cabinet's report and the 
report of the National Bank will have to be tabled for 
discussions in the National Assembly. They said they were not 
satisfied with the measures that the state and the bank 
institutions are taking to bring the crisis in the currency 
market under control. 
  The general strike announced by the Confederation of 
Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB), one of the major 
trade unions in the country, is also scheduled for mid-May. 
Today the Women's Democratic Union declared its support for the 
strike. "We neither support nor reject the strike but we cannot 
accept some of the conclusions about the economic situation in 
Bulgaria that the KNSB leadership has made," Mr. Sofiyanski 
said. He emphasized that according to SDS some of the trade 
union's demands are justified, but they can only be met by a 
strong government, formed after early parliamentary elections. 
  KNSB and Podkrepa, the two major labour amalgamations, did 
not attend today's regular meeting of the National Council for 
Tripartite Coordination. A week ago the two amalgamations 
walked out of the council over differences with the Government 
and warned this might be their first step towards a final 
withdrawal. 
  A special statement of the employers and the government, 
circulated this afternoon, says that "the refusal of the trade 
unions to participate in discussions poses a tangible obstacle 
to a final settlement of the social partnership problems." The 
employers and the government believe that irrespective of their 
differences on the issues concerning collective bargaining, at 
today's meeting they could have discussed current social 
problems. The statement denies the allegations made by the 
trade unions that the government was unwilling to reconsider the 
principles of incomes policy. 
  Today KNSB leader Prof. Krustyu Petkov made public a letter 
in which he says that the trade union is distancing itself 
completely from the policy of the government, "from the inaction 
and irresponsibility for the fate of the economic reform." KNSB 
is expecting the prime minister's personal response to the 
demands over which the amalgamation has threatened to go to 
strike. 
  The extraparliamentary Bulgarian Agrarian Party (BZNS) again 
criticized the government today accusing it of inability to cope 
with the grave problems in the country. BZNS is staging a rally 
and procession on April 23 under the slogan "Early Elections 
Will End Crisis". 
  The parliamentary BSP and DPS discussed cabinet changes this 
afternoon. The movement is considering so far only structural 
changes in the cabinet and it will leave it to the prime 
minister to decide on the personal replacements. According to 
DPS, the Committees of Tourism and Power Engineering should be 
transformed into separate ministries or placed under the 
jurisdiction of other ministries. DPS leader Ahmed Dogan is 
expected to meet with Prime Minister Lyuben Berov this week. 
Socialist PM's discussed changes in the government's policy. 
At the end of last week, BSP representatives handed the prime 
minister a memorandum setting forth their views. They expect 
suggestions and even structural changes in the government to be 
made by the end of April. The Socialists suggest the formation 
of a Ministry of Privatization, Ministry of the State 
Participation in Economy and a structure performing the 
functions of the former Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations.
