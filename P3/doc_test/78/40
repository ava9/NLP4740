  [Text] Sofia, February 21 (BTA) -- A delegation of the 
Russian Parliament, led by Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State 
Duma, met with Bulgarian National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur 
Yordanov this morning. The delegation arrived here on Saturday 
[19 February] on the first visit of Russian Duma members abroad. 
  Mr. Yordanov and Mr. Rybkin discussed the development of 
relations between Bulgaria and Russia and their economic crisis. 
  "We discussed the crisis in Bosnia and agreed that it can 
only be settled by peaceful means," Mr. Rybkin told reporters 
after the meeting. "All sanctions against former Yugoslavia 
which hinder our two countries' economies should be lifted," he 
said. "I familiarized Mr. Rybkin with Bulgaria's principled and 
invariable position of neutrality in the current complicated 
situation in ex- Yugoslavia. I also told him that for two years 
now Bulgaria has been calling on all countries in the Balkans to 
refrain from involvement in the Yugoconflict," the head of the 
Bulgarian Parliament said. "We assessed NATO's ultimatum as a 
means for faster settlement of the conflict, and the differences 
in our stands are minor," Mr. Yordanov added. 
  Later in the day, the Russian MP's discussed bilateral 
relations and the Yugocrisis at successive meetings with M.P's 
of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), the Union of Democratic 
Forces (SDS), the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms 
(DPS) and the New Union for Democracy (formed by expellees or 
breakways from the parliamentary SDS). 
  BSP floor leader Nora Ananieva described the meeting as a 
beginning of contacts between the two parliaments in the light 
of a general tendency towards a left and left-of-centre 
orientation of East European countries, the Parliamentary Press 
Centre announced after the meeting. According to BSP leader 
Zhan Videnov, the Russian delegation's visit is part of the 
active policy which Russia has been pursuing in the Balkans. 
BSP believes Russia's decisive interference to prevent further 
escalation of the conflict was not accidental and could be 
viewed as a serious success, crowning the several months' 
efforts of Russian foreign policy, Mr. Videnov told reporters 
after the meeting. "The Yugoembargo should not stand in the way 
of the peace process in former Yugoslavia. If the peace process 
gets an impetus, in the next few days we will have to reconsider 
the positive and possibly negative effects of the embargo. This 
does not concern the arms embargo which by all means should be 
kept against all warring parties," Mr. Videnov said, commenting 
on Mr. Rybkin's opinion on lifting the embargo against former 
Yugoslavia. Mr. Videnov announced that a delegation of the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party will visit Moscow in a week's time to 
meet Russian left-wing parties. 
  The parliamentary SDS set forth its position in favour of 
Bulgaria's independent foreign policy based on two priorities: 
Integration into the European structures and policy in the 
Balkans, stressing that the time of Balkan axes and blocs has 
gone, said Asparukh Panov MP of the SDS, chief Bulgarian 
delegate to the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly. "We 
expressed our satisfaction with the demilitarization of Sarajevo 
and congratulated our guests on Russia's active diplomatic 
interference in the last few days, which contributed to the 
success of NATO's ultimatum," Mr. Panov added. Asked if 
Bulgarian MP's sitting in the CE [Council of Europe] 
Parliamentary Assembly would support Russia's application for 
membership in the CE, Mr. Panov said that Russia is a major 
factor in the European processes but should meet some 
requirements to qualify for full membership in the CE, mainly 
concerning human and minority rights. 
  Conferring with members of the Parliamentary DPS, Mr. Rybkin 
stressed that the members of the State Duma support President 
Yeltsin in his efforts towards peaceful settlement of the 
conflict in Bosnia, DPS spokesman Yunal Lyutfi said after the 
meeting. DPS MP's have been formally invited by Mr. Rybkin to 
visit the Russian Duma.
