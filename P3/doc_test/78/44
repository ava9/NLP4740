<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Lyuben Berov by Irena </F>
Marinova at the Bulgarian National Assembly on 26 May: "No One 
Envies Me for the Role I Perform"] 
  [Text] On 26 May Prime Minister Berov was constantly 
besieged by TRUD reporters. The interview with him began in the 
parliament at noon, when the prime minister arrived for his 
meetings with the parliamentary factions, and continued, rather 
indelicately, when Professor Berov was on his way to or from the 
lavatory. When the prime minister heard the results of the 
vote, he answered the questions of our reporter first. 
<H5>  Before the Vote </H5>
  [Marinova] Mr. Prime Minister, why did you decide to ask for 
a vote of confidence on the basis of the government's program 
until September 1994, and not on a specific matter or on the 
cabinet's comprehensive policy? 
  [Berov] Why? The vote is on the cabinet's comprehensive 
policy. 
  [Marinova] What do you mean? The request for a confidence 
vote that was submitted today by Veselin Blagoev, chief 
secretary of the Council of Ministers, stresses that it is 
related to the program. 
  [Berov] Well, yes. This is our present comprehensive 
policy. What is so strange about it? 
  [Marinova] It is strange because you selected precisely this 
alternative, while the Constitution offers two additional 
alternatives. 
  [Berov] I think that this is the most prudent one. 
  [Marinova] What are your arguments? 
  [Berov] Oh, come on. What arguments do you want. (laughs) 
The argument is that we want to form an efficient government 
that will be limited in its term of office and tasks. The 
program we submitted represents the limited character of our 
tasks. 
  [Marinova] Would you like to head a caretaker cabinet? 
  [Berov] Ah, this does not depend on me only. It is not the 
executive power that forms a caretaker cabinet. 
  [Marinova] How long do you give the cabinet you head? 
  [Berov] You must ask the parliament. 
  [Marinova] Well, I am asking you, and I am interested in 
your forecast. 
  [Berov] For the time being, we are talking about the period 
until September. 
  [Marinova] Am I to understand that you are sure of the 
confidence vote? 
  [Berov] I think so, although we could also not receive it. 
It is up to parliament. 
  [Marinova] Do you refuse to resign because of an inner 
conviction or because of someone's pressure, and if so, who is 
this someone? 
  [Berov] No, this depends on me. I have said this 100 times, 
and I have said it to you too. I hope you understand. 
  [Marinova] Nevertheless, would you resign? 
  [Berov] No, there is no reason for that. 
  [Marinova] The impression emerges that deputies and 
parliamentary factions advise you to not resign. 
  [Berov] No, no. I say that if someone wants to foil this 
government, he must admit this. I stressed "if," and I was very 
clear and brief. 
  [Marinova] How could you explain a failure to sign the 
framework agreement? 
  [Berov] I would explain it by the unwillingness of the 
people to sign. 
  [Marinova] Whom do you see as the future prime minister? 
  [Berov] I do not determine this. If I was a king, I would 
have appointed prime ministers, but I am not one. 
  [Marinova] What did you discuss with the Bulgarian Socialist 
Party [BSP]? 
  [Berov] We discussed the program we submitted. 
  [Marinova] Did the Socialists say that they will support the 
government program until September? 
  [Berov] No, we did not talk about this. Their parliamentary 
faction must decide this. 
  [Marinova] But you said that you talked about the program? 
  [Berov] Discussing the merits of the program's elements is 
one thing and the support of the parliamentary faction is 
another. 
  [Marinova] Did you discuss structural and personnel changes 
in the cabinet with the BSP? 
  [Berov] No, their parliamentary faction will convene in two 
to three hours. 
  [Marinova] How could you explain the fact that a 
substantial part of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] will 
support you? 
  [Berov] Why do you ask me and not them? Let us see first if 
this happens. 
  [Marinova] I am sure that you will get your vote of 
confidence. 
  [Berov] I understand this, but I can answer your question 
only after the vote. 
  [Marinova] Have you been disappointed only by Ivan Pushkarov 
because of the double standards he demonstrated? 
  [Berov] Yes, deeply. 
  [Marinova] Who else? 
  [Berov] No one. Simply, this is the man with whom I talked 
at the Boyana residence, and who then said "I never saw him." 
(crosses himself) 
  [Marinova] Are you disappointed by the BSP? They also 
changed their position. 
  [Berov] No one else said "I never saw him." 
<H5>  After the Vote </H5>
  [Marinova] Prof. Berov, how do you explain the support of 
those 125 deputies? Did they do it because of you and your 
cabinet, or because they do not want to part with their 
parliamentary seats, since they know that they have no chance in 
the next parliament? 
  [Berov] I do not know. You must ask them. 
  [Marinova] (The time is 2010, and the first to greet the 
prime minister is Ahmed Dogan, leader of the Movement for Rights 
and Freedoms -- DPS). Are you sure that Mr. Ahmed Dogan was 
sincere in his greetings? 
  [Berov] I do not know. You must ask him. 
  [Marinova] Which politician do you think will be sincere in 
his greetings? 
  [Berov] I do not know. So far he was the only one to greet 
me. If you were the second I could say eventually that you were 
more sincere. 
  [Marinova] Could you repeat today the words of the ancient 
military leader "veni, vidi, vici" [I came, I saw, I conquered]? 
  [Berov] No. First of all I am not an ancient military 
leader. I even think that no one envies me for this role that I 
was entrusted with. 
  [Marinova] Do you not feel yourself to be a winner? 
  [Berov] No. It is not important how a man feels who has 
been entrusted with the task to steer the vessel out of the 
waves. 
  [Marinova] On whom do you rely? 
  [Berov] I do not rely on anything. 
  [Marinova] Were you ready to resign? 
  [Berov] Of course. If parliament would have voted 
negatively. 
  [Marinova] Will you make personnel changes in the cabinet? 
Should we expect structural changes? 
  [Berov] There are at least certain minimal changes that must 
be effected. Then there is a person who resigned. 
  [Marinova] Will the resignation of [Deputy Prime Minister] 
Karabashev be the only change? 
  [Berov] No. [Justice Minister] Kornazhev must also go. 
Actually, he has already been replaced. Thus, at least two 
people must go, and perhaps even more. 
  [Marinova] Will the agreement on the foreign debt save the 
cabinet? 
  [Berov] No. I even think that this is not the most crucial 
factor. (Turns to the journalists around him) Do not push! 
  [Marinova] If not the agreement on the foreign debt, then 
what saved you this time? 
  [Berov] I cannot tell you, because I do not know who voted 
for me. 
  [Marinova] I am asking you about the reasons, not about the 
personalities. 
  [Berov] I cannot answer this. 
  [Marinova] Thank you, Prof. Berov.
