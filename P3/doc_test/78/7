<F P=106> [Interview with Nedim Gendzhev, leader of the Democratic </F>
Party of Justice, by Nataliya Vuchkova; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Vuchkova] Dr. Gendzhev, is the Democratic Party 
of Justice ready with its program and, if elections are held, 
among which parties will it seek a coalition partner? 
  [Gendzhev] Our party will have a leftist orientation. We 
can work in coalition with both the Aleksandur Stamboliyski 
Bulgarian National Agrarian Union and the Bulgarian Socialist 
Party [BSP], despite the fact that some people will not like 
this. The party's program is social democratic in nature and 
close to the BSP program. The Union of Democratic Forces, which 
claims to be a democratic party, has nothing to show the people 
apart from a pronounced primeval anticommunism. However, this 
will not help us emerge from the economic crisis, which can only 
be achieved by national consensus reached by making compromises. 
  If anyone analyzes the activities of the Bulgarian 
Parliament 
during the last two years, he will reach the conclusion that 
Bulgaria has no Bulgarians who think about their state, only 
anticommunists and sodomists. 
  [Vuchkova] Dr. Gendzhev, do you think your party will 
capture votes from the electorates of the Movement for Rights 
and Freedoms [DPS] and Mehmed Hodja's party? 
  [Gendzhev] We address ourselves to all people, regardless of 
their party affiliations or official position. We want to 
develop an economic program for the regions that are in the most 
wretched situation. The present government is a DPS one, but 
not one that represents the DPS electorate; it is a government 
of Ahmed Dogan, Osman Oktay, Yunal Lyutfi, Kadir Kadir, and a 
handful of others. More than a half of the electors who voted 
for the DPS at the last elections will now cast their votes for 
the coalition that we will form. However, one thing is clear -- 
namely that from now on we will not enter any coalition with the 
DPS or Mehmed Hodja. 
  [Vuchkova] How will you react to possible accusations that 
you formed a party on an ethnic basis? 
  [Gendzhev] One should not make such speculations if a Turk 
or Muslim stands at the head of a party. I believe that, in 
this case, one cannot say that our party is religiously or 
ethnically based. 
  [Vuchkova] Would you like to comment on the recent practice 
of identifying religious with ethnic features. 
  [Gendzhev] One cannot identify the Muslim religion with 
Turkish nationality. Armenians, Bulgarians, Turks, and Romanies 
may all be Muslims. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who was both a 
Frenchman and a Muslim, did not identify himself as a Turk, did 
he? It must be made clear that Islam is a world religion, not a 
Turkish one. 
  A degree of Turkification may indeed be taking place in 
certain regions, but the more attention you draw to a problem, 
the more it comes to the forefront of public attention. When 
they made the Muslims change their names and closed the mosques, 
did this turn them into Bulgarians?
