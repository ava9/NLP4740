  [Excerpts] Sofia, May 4 (BTA) -- Over 800,000 members of 
5,691 trade union locals nationwide took part in the warning 
strike called by the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions 
in Bulgaria (KNSB) today, KNSB Vice President Zhelyazko Khristov 
told a news briefing. He said that 641,392 people were on 
effective strike, suspending work for an hour. On April 14 KNSB 
staged another nationwide protest, a rally in Sofia. Members of 
the other major trade union, the Podkrepa Labour Confederation, 
as well as of the Association of Independent Trade Unions and 
the National Trade Union also joined in the protest, KNSB leader 
Krustyu Petkov said at a news briefing this morning. The 
leadership of the Podkrepa Labour Confederation supports KNSB's 
demands but advised its members not to take part in the strike. 
None of the political forces generally sympathizes with the 
KNSB, but they have not spoken openly against the 
confederation's demands and the means of protest it has chosen, 
either, Prof. Petkov said in an interview with the PARI daily 
which was published yesterday. Of the parliamentary political 
forces, the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) sticks to a 
position of neutrality, while the Bulgarian Socialist Party 
(BSP) supports the strike provided that it is not politicized. 
Several political parties and public organizations voiced 
support for the KNSB. 
  According to Prof. Petkov, the strike has been well 
organized. Teachers, civil servants, employees in transport, 
trade, services and some branches of industry are the most 
widely represented. A one-hour warning strike took place in 
over 4,000 schools, nursery schools and kindergartens with staff 
running up to 190,000, said a representative of the Teachers 
Trade Union with the KNSB. The bridge over the River Danube on 
the Bulgarian-Romanian border was blocked for an hour this 
morning, said Prof. Petkov. Two checkpoints at the border with 
Turkey, Kapitan Andreevo and Svilengrad-Ormenion, also suspended 
operation for an hour. Protest rallies and processions are 
being held. Strikers present their demands in declarations to 
parliament and the government. A rally of doctors and teachers 
in Plovdiv (southern Bulgaria) failed to take place because it 
was banned by city authorities. 
  Today's warning strike is part of the preparations for the 
general strike scheduled to take place on May 17. The KNSB 
insists for incomes compensation. According to Prof. Petkov, 
80 percent of the population is now below the subsistence level 
owing to the steep rise of the U.S. dollar against the lev in 
the recent months, the introduction of VAT [value-added tax] as 
of April 1 and the inertness of the government. The KNSB also 
demands that a government programme for the stabilization of the 
finance market be developed, and that the cabinet take a clear 
stand on the means to defend Bulgarian producers. Another 
demand is transparency as to Bulgaria's commitments to 
international institutions. At a rally in Pernik (western 
Bulgaria) today Prof. Petkov said that the KNSB demands that an 
industry-wide collective agreement be signed for 1994. The 
agreement is ready and only the part concerning wages is yet to 
be agreed, he explained. [passage omitted] 
  Yesterday Prime Minister Lyuben Berov notified Prof. Petkov 
that he was ready to start negotiations on May 11 and would 
personally head the government's delegation (as demanded by the 
KNSB). The start of negotiations, however, does not yet mean 
giving up the strike, said Prof. Petkov. As he told PARI, the 
prime minister would go to considerable compromise to get an 
agreement. However, the stands of the prime minister and the 
KNSB as to the protection of the population's savings and of 
local producers are completely opposite, he said. If the 
demands of the KNSB are to be met, that would require actions by 
parliament, too, Prof. Petkov pointed out repeatedly. During 
the period between May 4 and May 17, there will be regional 
protests as well as protests in different branches and 
enterprises, indefinite strikes included. 
  The KNSB press centre reported that the police in Burgas 
(southern Bulgaria, on the Black Sea) and Dupnitsa (western 
Bulgaria, 60 km from Sofia) arrested seven trade union 
activists, including the Confederation's Executive Secretary 
Doncho Donchev. [passage omitted] 
  KNSB leader Krustyu Petkov met with Interior Minister Viktor 
Mikhaylov and the Chief Secretary of the Interior Ministry Kosta 
Bogatsevski. According to Mr. Mikhaylov and Mr. Bogatsevski, 
the trade union leaders had not been arrested. They were only 
taken to the police station for questioning and statements were 
drawn up. Tomorrow morning and the day after tomorrow Prof. 
Petkov and General Kosta Bogatsevski will go to Dupnitsa and 
Nesebur to sort things out on the spot.
