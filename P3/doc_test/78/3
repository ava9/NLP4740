leaders on Prime Minister Berov's statement on national radio on 
25 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] How do the Bulgarian Socialists assess Prime 
Minister Lyuben Berov's statement on national radio today. Here 
is a comment by Nora Ananieva, chairman of the parliamentary 
group of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] and its coalition: 
  [Ananieva] The prime minister's viewpoint was realistic, in 
the sense that stability, our authority, continuing the reform 
without interruption, and developing our international contacts 
all depend on the budget being passed. 
  [Announcer] Professor Lyuben Berov's address provoked a 
quick reaction from the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] 
coalition. Here is what Filip Dimitrov, chairman of the SDS 
National Coordinating Council, had to say: 
  [Dimitrov] We have long considered that the only reasonable 
alternative to the chaos that reigns in the country's economy 
and the drama that is developing on the streets of Bulgarian 
towns is to hold new elections. Accordingly, in making his 
statement, the prime minister hardly discovered America. As 
regards the issue of the budget, in his statement the prime 
minister made a fetish, as it were, of the act of adopting a 
law, but disregarded its contents. 
  [Announcer] The parliamentary group of the Rights and 
Freedoms Movement [DPS] will support the initiative calling for 
a special plenary session of parliament on the state budget 
bill, but the DPS deputies do not consider that 16 February is a 
realistic deadline for adopting the budget. Here is a comment 
from DPS parliamentary representative Osman Oktay on the prime 
minister's statement: 
  [Oktay] I would describe the prime minister's statement on 
the budget as somewhat overhasty. We have assured him -- we 
have given an assurance in the proper place -- that we will do 
everything possible to speed up the submission of the budget to 
a plenary session of the National Assembly. 
  [Announcer] DPS deputies expressed their disquiet over the 
delays in the examination of the budget by certain parliamentary 
commissions. According to them, the early submission of the 
budget bill to the full parliament is of importance primarily in 
connection with our commitments under the agreement with the 
international financial institutions. According to Deputy 
Oktay, the president will probably meet with the DPS leader 
[Ahmed Dogan] next week. According to DPS Deputy Serife Mustafa, 
this meeting may take place tomorrow.
