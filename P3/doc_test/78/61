<F P=106> [Interview with Bulgarian Socialist Party leader Zhan </F>
Videnov by Rozalina Evdokimova; place and date not given: 
"Urgent Changes in Government Are Needed"] 
  [Excerpts] [Evdokimova] Mr. Videnov, do you see a 
coincidence between the interview President Zhelev gave to the 
BBC British radio station and the arrival of observers of the 
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Bulgaria, who 
will analyze the political situation and "recommunization" in 
Bulgaria? 
  [Videnov] I do not think that there is such a connection, 
however, it is obvious that ideological statements and 
scholastic disputes, as well as deliberately fanning 
confrontation rather than discussing the real socioeconomic 
problems of the Bulgarians today, are a basic issue for 
President Zhelev, and for people who do not know our country's 
reality. It is not strange that foreigners assume such a 
position. They are far away from the country's reality and not 
especially concerned with its real problems. However, the 
position of the president is absolutely inadmissible for any 
head of state. 
  [Evdokimova] Mr. Zhelev devoted a lot of space in his 
interview to the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] and the 
situation in our country. Speaking about the BSP's support for 
the cabinet, Mr. Zhelev said that this is nothing else but a 
road leading to new elections, already in the fall. What could 
you say about this? 
  [Videnov] The fact that the cabinet relies on the BSP 
despite the fact that Berov's cabinet contains many BSP 
opponents from the near and remote past, implies that the BSP is 
a highly responsible, state-responsible, and competent party, 
capable of participating in the government (unlike the other 
parties, which regardless of the people's vote results, are 
unable of translating this vote to governing). I include among 
these parties the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] that 
President Zhelev likes so much, and even the president himself, 
as former SDS leader. Within the framework of the confidence 
received by the people in 1991 the BSP helps the country to 
resolve its most urgent problems. It is the success or failure 
of these efforts that will determine when Bulgaria will head 
toward new elections. It must be pointed out that these are the 
efforts of the entire country, rather than the efforts of a 
single party or the government. [passage omitted] 
  [Evdokimova] The BSP is being ever more frequently accused 
of being responsible for the economic and social situation that 
emerged in the country, and for supporting a cabinet that cannot 
do its job. What could you say about this? 
  [Videnov] The situation could be corrected through early 
parliamentary elections. If someone thinks that he is ready for 
such a step toward decisively improving the situation in the 
country, let him convince the people that they should 
participate in such a step. However, the people are not 
convinced of this. It is not clear what early elections could 
contribute to the country. As long as the cabinet remains 
within the framework of its program and tries to move things 
forward, it could rely on a certain parliamentary consensus. 
This support will be denied when the cabinet fails. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Evdokimova] Will you demand personnel changes in the 
cabinet? 
  [Videnov] Of course. They are absolutely necessary and 
should have been effected immediately after the budget was 
adopted. The changes have been postponed because of the prime 
minister's illness, however, they will become topical again, as 
soon as next week.
