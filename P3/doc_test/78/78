  [Excerpts] Sofia, January 7 (BTA) -- Today's press 
allegations that President Zhelyu Zhelev intended to assume 
direct command of the Bulgarian Army provoked a chain of 
reactions. 
  Speaking to a National Radio reporter, President Zhelev 
strongly denied the allegations and described them as 
"insinuations serving dubious political interests." Zhan 
Videnov, leader of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), did not 
deny he had prior information of the scandal which broke out in 
today's press and told a radio interviewer the issue had been 
addressed indirectly at his meeting with Filip Dimitrov, leader 
of the Union of the Democratic Forces (SDS), two days ago. In a 
radio statement Edvin Sugarev, MP of the SDS and leader of one 
of the SDS-affiliated parties, said the president should be 
asked to tender his resignation. 
  A front-page story in TRUD claims that President Zhelev 
intended to issue a decree by which he would assume direct 
command of the Bulgarian Army. The daily runs in full a 
November 1993 letter from President Zhelev to the defense 
minister and the chief of General Staff, according to which the 
advisers at the president's military office would get ranks from 
second-in-command of the armed services up to deputy chiefs of 
the General Staff. The daily quotes anonymous Constitutional 
Law experts as describing the act as "a flagrant violation of 
the Constitution." The Socialists' daily DUMA, says that Army 
General Lyuben Petrov, chief of the General Staff, declined to 
comment on the president's letter yesterday. 24 CHASA quotes an 
anonymous MP as saying that Prime Minister Lyuben Berov learned 
about the letter later (after it had been sent) but did not step 
in to defuse the scandal and his relations with the president 
had been tense ever since. The MP told 24 CHASA that advisers 
to the president had been building structures parallel to key 
units of the cabinet, which was one of the major reasons for the 
meeting between the SDS and BSP leaders. 
  We had fears over suggestions to give the president greater 
prerogatives than the ones outlined in the Constitution, Zhan 
Videnov said in a radio interview. According to him, these 
ideas originated with "intellectual, journalistic and social 
circles close to the office of the president" rather than with 
the office itself. "I must say we were informed in advance of 
the press scandal over the prerogatives of the president's 
military office which flared up today. We see it as an alarming 
symptom and though indirectly, this subject was part of our 
discussion," Zhan Videnov said about his meeting with SDS leader 
Filip Dimitrov. In a statement quoted on National Radio Dr. 
Zhelev commented, among other things, on the meeting between the 
SDS and BSP leaders, describing it as "a result of the grave 
crisis in both political forces, which arouses fear of the 
democratic institutions." The president disapproved the idea of 
a parliament-appointed caretaker government, as well as of the 
idea that parliament should work in the run-up to the elections. 
  Edvin Sugarev described today's press allegations as "a huge 
scandal... for which President Zhelev's resignation should be 
demanded." 
  The president's spokesman Valentin Stoyanov made an official 
statement on the press allegations late this afternoon. 
[passage omitted]. The statement was broadcast on national 
radio and television. In its main evening newscast television 
said three Socialist MP's have made an official request today 
for copies of the president's letter to the Defense Ministry and 
of the decree. [passage omitted]
