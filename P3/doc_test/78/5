  [Text] Today the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] 
parliamentary group deposited at the office of the National 
Assembly a motion of no confidence in Prime Minister Lyuben 
Berov due to his inability to organize and lead the Council of 
Ministers. The aim of the SDS is evidently to forestall the 
prime minister's statement on structural and personnel changes 
in the cabinet that he is expected to make next Thursday, our 
reporter Antoaneta Puncheva points out. 
  Prime Minister Lyuben Berov's proposal for structural and 
personnel changes in the government will be discussed at a 
special plenum of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], BSP 
leader Zhan Videnov stated at today's meeting of BSP deputies. 
The BSP deputies reported after the meeting that the plenum 
will be scheduled for the day when the prime minister officially 
presents his cabinet's program intentions in parliament, so the 
exact date is not clear at the moment. 
  The deputies of the New Alliance for Democracy [NSD] decided 
at their meeting today not to support Prime Minister Lyuben 
Berov's expected proposal on structural and personnel changes in 
the Council of Ministers. 
  All the political forces, especially those in the 
parliamentary center, should reach a consensus on the cabinet 
shuffle, even at the cost of making compromises -- this was the 
common view of Ahmed Dogan, DPS [Movement for Rights and 
Freedoms] leader, and Aleksandur Tomov, leader of the Civic 
Alliance for the Republic. They had a long discussion in 
parliament today, the main subject of which was the government 
changes. According to Tomov, Dogan and he found that they 
shared quite a number of common viewpoints in their positions. 
  Regarding the hardline position of the NSD deputies not to 
take part in the vote on Professor Berov's program, Aleksandur 
Tomov expects a slow but sure evolution in the views of the 
parties and organizations in the NSD group, and Ahmed Dogan 
predicts the same. The idea of forming a new cabinet within the 
term of the present parliament is not a bad one, Aleksandur 
Tomov thinks, but at the moment it is simply unrealistic.
