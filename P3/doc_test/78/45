  [Text] An expanded plenum of the Supreme Council and 
parliamentary faction of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] 
took place in Sofia today. The participants discussed the draft 
program of the forthcoming 41st BSP Congress. This is how BSP 
leader Zhan Videnov assessed today's plenum: 
  [Begin Videnov recording] I am very satisfied with the 
results of today's open and expanded plenum. The party 
obviously has a good potential that allows it to generate ideas 
of a really profound and programmatic essence and discuss them 
in a calm and civilized manner. I hope that when the drafts, 
which have already been prepared, are soon published, this style 
of debate will be transferred to the entire party and society. 
We are prepared to calmly discuss the results of this plenum at 
the congress. [end recording] 
  The Alliance for Social Democracy was the only faction 
within 
the BSP that presented its own draft program for the forthcoming 
congress. Chavdar Kyuranov, chairman of the Alliance for Social 
Democracy, assessed today's plenum in the following manner.: 
  [Begin Kyuranov recording] Something very important took 
place at today's plenum. The plenum steered itself toward 
adopting a very democratic decision --to form a commission that 
will work on the draft programs and produce a uniform proposal 
for the program. This decision differs from previous decisions 
on the same matter. As far as our program is concerned, I have 
a technical explanation. We were able to submit our draft 
rather late. It was disseminated only this morning, so we could 
not ask the plenum participants to express their opinions on our 
draft program. [end recording]
