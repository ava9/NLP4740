<F P=106> [Report by Galya Nikolova: "Discontented DPS Members Form </F>
New Party] 
  [Text] Former deputies of the Movement for Rights and 
Freedoms [DPS] who left the parliamentary factions of the DPS 
and approximately 150 supporters established the Party of 
Democratic Changes over the weekend of 28-29 May. Mehmed Hodja 
was elected chairman, and National Assembly member Ismail Ismail 
and Sabri Hyusein, lawyer from Plovdiv, were elected deputy 
chairmen. 
  Statements made at the meeting voiced dissatisfaction with 
the DPS and its leaders. The new formation will seek an 
alliance with all non-communist forces and will reject any 
cooperation with the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]. The new 
party categorically dissociates itself from the manifestations 
of nationalism and separatism, reads the program that was 
adopted. The charter stresses that any member disseminating 
nationalist ideas will be ousted from the party. The new party 
will struggle against the practice according to which minority 
members only become members of parties formed on an ethnic 
foundation. The party considers itself to be on the right side 
of the political spectrum and supports the mixed election 
system. The first national forum will take place by the end of 
the year. Informed sources think that several local DPS 
branches will participate. 
  [DPS spokesman] Yunal Lyutfi described the new party as a 
new 
attempt to split the DPS and predicted that it will have the 
same fate as Adem Kenan's organization.
