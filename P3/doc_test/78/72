  [Text] The discussion on the new charter of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP] has been going on for six hours now. 
Thus, the forecast of many delegates -- that the basic party 
document would be adopted without any problems -- has been 
proven wrong. According to our correspondents at the congress, 
the delegates have only adopted only one-third of the charter's 
articles so far. However, according to circles in the BSP 
Supreme Council, the basic work is still to come because the 
disputed articles related to the BSP Supreme Council's rights 
and prerogatives, its relations with the parliamentary factions, 
and the elections of the DUMA chief editor have not yet been 
discussed. 
  Our correspondents have predicted that because of the 
prolonged discussion on the charter, the 41st BSP Congress will 
begin the procedure to elect the new BSP leading organs and 
party leader late tonight or possibly even tomorrow morning. 
Different names of possible candidates for the post of party 
leader are mentioned in the corridors -- among them Zhan 
Videnov, Aleksandur Marinov, Yanaki Stoilov, Nikolay Kamov, and 
Georgi Pirinski.
