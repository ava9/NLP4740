  [Text] Sofia, March 30 (BTA) -- Bulgaria's President 
Zhelyu Zhelev is on an informal visit to London. He told a news 
conference there that early parliamentary elections will 
probably be held in Bulgaria before the end of this year. This 
morning the [Bulgarian] national radio aired the president's 
comments on home policy issues at the press conference in London. 
  In connection with a commentary in THE FINANCIAL TIMES that 
Prime Minister Lyuben Berov's state of health (after a heart 
failure in early March he underwent surgery) might provoke a 
political crisis and early elections, thus delaying the reform 
process, the President said: "The problem is not the PM's state 
of health. He will recover and I am sure that a month from now 
he will be even more efficient than before. The problem is that 
the government itself is flawed, and so is the formula of its 
formation." The present cabinet was formed at the end of 1992 
as a government of experts, not affiliated to any party. 
  President Zhelev blamed the cabinet for counting too much on 
the support of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (the former 
communists) and pointed out that it ought to pursue its reform 
programme, taking the risk of losing parliament's support. 
According to the president, there are two possible solutions: 
"Either this parliament will have to appoint a non-communist 
government, backed by the Union of Democratic Forces, the New 
Union for Democracy, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, and 
the independent MP's, that would pursue the reforms 
consistently, or we are heading for elections." It seems that 
elections will be held before the end of this year, he said. 
  When asked whether a possible new cabinet, dominated by the 
BSP (ranking first in opinion polls), would not make matters 
even worse in regard to the reform, President Zhelev was 
positive that the BSP is unable to form a cabinet. "In my 
opinion, the BSP will find it hard to dominate the future 
parliament. The problem it faces is not how to win the 
elections; that will not be very difficult. The hard part of it 
will come after the elections, when its victory will be of no 
use, as it will be unable to form a cabinet," he said. 
  As to the steep rise of the key currencies against the 
Bulgarian lev in the past few weeks, President Zhelev believes 
it to be the result of speculation. Certain circles in Bulgaria 
will benefit from that, as enterprises put up for privatization 
will be twice cheaper, he explained. According to the 
president, the central bank and the government can take measures 
to stabilize the national currency, but the important point is 
to step up privatization and restitution.
