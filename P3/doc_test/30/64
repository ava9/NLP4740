<P>
Eleven of the 25 biggest real estate deals in Southern California last year 
occurred in Orange County, according to a San Diego market-research firm. 
</P>
<P>
The number of local deals, led by the $83-million sale of two Newport Center 
office buildings, exceeded by three the eight sales in Los Angeles County, 
COMPS Inc. reported. But the Los Angeles deals involved more money. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County sales added up to $511 million, or 36% of the $1.4-billion 
total, COMPS said. The eight Los Angeles deals totaled $656 million, or 46%. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County transactions included four office and retail projects, four 
land parcels and three apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics underscored the county's active real estate market last year and 
the rising cost of real estate, especially the cost of land for new residential 
housing developments. 
</P>
<P>
"Our clients were looking at land prices and saying, 'If I buy this, I'll never 
be able to build something for a price I could sell it at,' " said S. Kelly 
McDermott, vice president of Market Profiles, a Costa Mesa market-research 
firm. He added: 
</P>
<P>
"But then they'd say, 'If I don't buy it, somebody else will.' So they bought 
it and built the houses and behold -- the houses sold at what would have been 
unbelievable prices just a little while before." 
</P>
<P>
It was also a year in which there were some fairly big purchases of office 
buildings, although the 1988 buyers, unlike those in 1987's bigger deals, were 
not Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"There was much broader interest in Orange County office buildings than there 
has been in the past," said Scott Perley, a vice president of the commercial 
real estate brokerage of Cushman &amp; Wakefield of California Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"The buying wasn't a lot more aggressive, but a lot of people were looking 
because office-leasing activity is still strong," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Also high on the 1988 list were apartment complexes. Investors believe that 
high home prices will keep many residents renting and that the county's booming 
economy will attract plenty of new residents to fill the complexes. The problem 
is that hardly anybody is selling, so prices remain high even though renter 
demand shows signs of softening. 
</P>
<P>
The two biggest transactions of 1988 were both in Los Angeles: the sales of the 
Fox Plaza for $320 million and the Sanwa Bank building for $88 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 11 Orange County deals follow, listed according to size. 
</P>
<P>
* The sale of the two office buildings at Newport Center in Newport Beach 
ranked third on the Southern California list. Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. 
sold the office buildings and a restaurant for $83 million -- $309 per square 
foot -- to the California State Teachers Retirement System. The sale was 
believed to have set a record for the highest price per square foot paid for 
offices in Orange County. The transaction did not include the insurance 
company's headquarters building nearby. 
</P>
<P>
* Three office buildings known as Nexus Financial Center on Parker Street in 
Orange were 4th on the list of 25. The buyer was JMB Realty Trust, a Chicago 
real estate investment firm that has been acquiring a lot of property in 
Southern California. The seller, receiving $58.2 million, was Nexus Equities 
U.S.A., a Newport Beach developer. 
</P>
<P>
* Ranking 5th was 416 acres of undeveloped land between Oso and Marguerite 
parkways sold by the Mission Viejo Co. to Home Capitol Corp. and its partner, 
Irvine home builder Barratt American Inc., for construction of up to 1,500 
homes in a development called Pacific Hills. The price was $57.5 million. The 
Mission Viejo Co. announced in 1987 that it was getting out of the 
home-building business and has made several large land sales recently. This 
deal was believed to be one of the largest land deals in recent times in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
* Charter Centre, a high-rise office building and retail complex at Beach 
Boulevard and Warner Avenue, was sold by Mola Development Corp. for $55 million 
and ranked 8th. Guardian Savings &amp; Loan Assn. was the buyer of the 
3-year-old complex, housing Mola's corporate headquarters. Although the 
building was 90% leased, the high price surprised some in the industry because 
the building is outside the bustling John Wayne Airport area. Guardian said it 
would move its headquarters to the office tower. 
</P>
<P>
* Two office buildings and a garage on Dupont Drive in Irvine, called Dupont 
Centre, ranked 9th. They were sold for $51.2 million by Dupont Centre 
Associates, a partnership of the Canadian company BCE Development and Legacy 
Office Development Co. in Irvine. The buyer was USAA Real Estate Co., a 
subsidiary of pension-fund adviser USAA in San Antonio, Tex. With 250,000 
square feet of space, the buildings sold for about $210 per square foot, about 
average for office deals in the county last year. 
</P>
<P>
* The Mission Viejo Co. sold 161 acres off Marguerite Parkway in Mission Viejo 
to J.M. Peters Co. The price was $42.9 million and the transaction ranked 13th. 
Peters, a Newport Beach home builder, is building a $200-million, 904-unit 
community for the elderly called Palmia on the site, the company's first foray 
into that kind of housing. Peters also had the 22nd-biggest transaction on the 
list, a $30.6-million purchase of 49.5 acres from Griffin Homes in Calabasas in 
Los Angeles County near the Ventura County line, an area of extremely expensive 
luxury homes that is just now being intensively developed. 
</P>
<P>
* The 448-unit Casa Del Sol apartment complex on Brookhurst Avenue went for 
$35.3 million and ranked 18th. The seller was Matteson Investment Corp. and the 
buyer was Richard J. Battaglia of Huntington Beach, a 45-year-old developer of 
overseas amusement parks and a local real estate magnate. The deal was part of 
a tax-deferred transaction that included the sale of Battaglia's 242-unit 
Woodlake Village apartments in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
* Ranking 19th was another land transaction: 153 acres off Avenida Pico outside 
San Clemente. Apartments, condominiums, a hotel and stores will be built on 90 
of those acres. The area is surrounded by big housing developments. Selling the 
parcel for $35.2 million was the local development arm of Western Savings &amp; 
Loan Assn., a troubled Phoenix thrift that owns a lot of land in the Rancho San 
Clemente area and has been operating under the supervision of federal 
regulators since last year. The buyer was a partnership called Rancho San 
Clemente Town Center Associates, which is half-owned by a company called Shanco 
Inc., which is in turn owned by Byron Tarnutzer of the Newport Beach 
development firm Tarnutzer Cos. The other half of Town Center Associates is 
owned by Hexagon Group, a subsidiary of the British clothing manufacturer 
Burton PLC. Tarnutzer said the land has recently been rezoned to accommodate 
the apartments, condos and stores. 
</P>
<P>
* In 20th place was the Somerset Park apartment complex on Jefferson Avenue in 
Placentia. Buying for $33.2 million was the Pacific Co. Selling was Somerset 
Park Development. 
</P>
<P>
* Ranking 21st was another piece of land bought by J.M. Peters and a partner, 
Canadian home builder Bramalea California Inc. in Costa Mesa. That parcel was 
282 acres off Portola Parkway northeast of El Toro, planned for residential 
development. The price was $33 million and the seller was Foothill Ranch Co., a 
partnership of Hon Development Co. of Laguna Hills, said to be one of the 
largest landowners in the county. Peters said it plans to build 500 homes on 
its share of the land. 
</P>
<P>
* Another apartment-complex sale ranked 25th, the Wimbledon Glen apartments on 
Buckingham Drive in Costa Mesa. Selling for $26.8 million was Wells Fargo Bank. 
The buyer was Arnel Management Co., a subsidiary of the giant Costa Mesa 
apartment developer and manager Arnel Development Co. 
</P>
<P>
COMPS warned that it only reports deals that it can confirm, so some large 
transactions for which details couldn't be obtained may have been left out.
