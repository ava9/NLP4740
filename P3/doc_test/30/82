QUESTION: What do companies such as Northrop, Blue Cross, Dataproducts and 
Products Research &amp; Chemical Corp. have in common? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Sale-lease-backs. Each of these companies has sold a chunk of its real 
estate holdings, yet continues to operate at the same locations -- but as 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
One advantage to becoming a big company is that the business can stop paying 
rent and buy its own building instead. Within the last several years, however, 
a long list of businesses have been reversing this pattern by selling off their 
real estate and opting for a lease. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to happen a lot more," predicts Daniel E. Powell, president of 
CityPacific Commercial Real Estate Services. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially with the demise of junk bonds," Powell reasoned, "companies will 
need to look at alternative ways to raise capital." And, he added, what better 
source of cash is there for a company than selling off a piece of real estate 
that has accelerated in value? 
</P>
<P>
For most public companies, simply taking out a loan on the property doesn't 
make sense. 
</P>
<P>
For tax and accounting reasons, only the purchase price of a property is listed 
on a company's balance sheet. So, if a property was bought for $1 million and 
is worth $10 million today, its still gets listed as a $1 million asset. 
</P>
<P>
A $10 million loan on the property, however, shows up as a $10 million 
liability -- so the company may look like it has more liabilities than assets 
if it takes out a mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
A direct sale with no lease-back often requires a company to pay capital gains 
taxes that can eat up a third of the property's appreciation. But with a 
sale-lease-back, said accountant Ron Silver, the seller can skirt such taxes. 
</P>
<P>
This strategy has been most popular with single-tenant industrial buildings, 
added Silver, who is director of entrepreneurial services at Ernst &amp; Young 
in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
Managers and corporate raiders trying to facilitate a leveraged buyout of their 
company have also used the strategy to raise cash for their acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
A prime example is Dataproducts Corp. in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, DPC Acquisition Partners tried to finance a takeover of Dataproducts 
by agreeing in advance to sell the company's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The buyout fell though, but Dataproducts' executives cut a deal to sell their 
land to Trizec Properties Inc. and use the money to rebuild the company while 
fighting off any unfriendly suitors. Trizec, in turn, secured a well-located 
property suitable for development in several years. In the meantime, the buyer 
gets a stable tenant too. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers Paul Locker and Tony Maniscalchi of The Prudential Stevenson Real 
Estate completed the sale and lease-back of 14 small buildings in Glendale that 
serve as home to Products Research &amp; Chemical Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done quite a few of these transactions in the last year," Locker said. 
In his most recent deal, the sellers get to stay on as tenants for the next 
five years. The buyers -- 17 of them to be exact -- buy not only the property, 
but time to negotiate alternative uses for the property when the lease expires. 
</P>
<P>
Not everybody is convinced that sale-lease-backs have a bright future, though. 
Eventually, companies will realize they've sold out and have no place to go, 
said Tony Yocham, president of the Reichman Group in Newport Beach. "What 
happens at the end of the lease?" 
</P>
<P>
"It is as if you've sold you're birthright," Yocham said. Initial lease 
payments may be low -- but eventually a rent escalation clause cames to haunt 
the lessee. 
</P>
<P>
As American businesses are forced to think about long-term versus merely 
short-term profits, he predicted, the sale-lease-back phenomenon will lose its 
current popularity.

Leases 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three new tenants have signed leases with JMB/Urban Development at the 
soon-to-be-completed 1999 Avenue of the Stars office tower in Century City. Law 
firm O'Melveny &amp; Myers has committed itself to 60,000 square feet on three 
floors; Act III Communications, an entertainment firm founded by Norman Lear, 
will occupy 41,000 square feet on two floors; and merchant bankers Wasserstein 
Perella Group will fill 10,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, First Los Angeles Bank has expanded its planned occupancy to 
nearly 33,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
These most recent leases have an aggregate value of more than $70 million, with 
terms ranging from 10 to 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Consumer electronics retailer Silo has leased 318,000 square feet of 
distribution space in Fontana's Lincoln Industrial Center. The Staubach Co. 
represented Silo in its 10-year, $9.3-million lease. Coldwell Banker 
represented the lessor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Developments 
</P>
<P>
 -- Trammell Crow is nearing completion of renovation and addition work at 
Parkway La Mirada, a $41 million business park fronting Valley View Boulevard 
in La Mirada. The 24-acre site has 402,000 square feet of office, service 
center and retail space, including The Atrium -- a four-story office building 
that formerly was headquarters of Denny's International. 
</P>
<P>
Trammell Crow and joint-venture partner Copley Real Estate Advisors are set to 
open a 51,000-square-foot office building called The Landmark in June. 
</P>
<P>
In Westlake Village, Trammell Crow has bought the Olive Grove Shopping Center 
from Mitsui Manufacturers and is planning to convert the 8-acre site to an 
office center to be known as The Watercourt. The developer and joint-venture 
partner New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. are scheduled to reopen the 
center in September, after completing a $10-million rehab. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Construction work started recently on Bentall Executive Centre -- a 
two-phase office project at 1551 Tustin Ave. in Santa Ana. Phase I includes a 
10-story, 205,000-square-foot office building and a seven-level parking 
structure valued at $35 million. The project is owned by Bentall/Westminister 
Partners, a general partnership made up of Bentall Properties Inc. of Orange 
and Tanasana Properties Inc., a unit of United Kingdom-based Yattendon 
Investment Trust. Financing is being provided by The Royal Bank of Canada.
