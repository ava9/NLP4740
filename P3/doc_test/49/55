  [Text] The Narcotics Control Board said today that it has 
announced that the security agencies seized 1.739 million kg of 
cocaine, heroin, and Indian hemp in 1993 and arrested 147 drug 
peddlers during the period. 
  According to figures released by the board, the haul is an 
increase on 1.471 million kg seized in 1992 during which 87 
people were arrested. The board said, however, that in view of 
inadequate facilities, the figures quoted fall below the actual 
trend. 
  It said 71 Ghanaians were arrested outside the country, 
mainly in the United States and Thailand.
