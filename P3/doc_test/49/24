  [Text] An eight-member Cuban delegation led by the foreign 
minister, Mr. Roberto Robaina, arrived in Accra last night on a 
two- day official visit. Speaking to newsmen, Mr. Robaina said 
Cuba will survive the U.S. trade embargo imposed on her despite 
the current difficulties she is facing. He said in spite of the 
sanctions, basic social services such as health delivery, 
education, and transport continue to operate normally. 
  The foreign minister, whose visit is the first to Africa 
since he was appointed nine months ago, said Cuba has had to 
face the difficulties with a lot of hard work. He said the 
efforts and sacrifices of Cubans over the years have started 
yielding positive results. 
  Mr. Robaina said the existing bonds of friendship between 
Cuba and Ghana are very healthy and that he is here to put 
Cuba's case across. He said what Cuba expects from Ghana now is 
an increase in the level of cooperation in all areas of mutual 
interest. 
  On Cuba's foreign policy, Mr. Robaina said his government is 
taking steps to adopt a new policy to meet the changing times. 
The delegation was met on arrival by the foreign minister and 
acting attorney general, Dr. Obed Asamoah. From Ghana, it will 
go on to Zambia, Zimbabwe, Angola, and Namibia.
