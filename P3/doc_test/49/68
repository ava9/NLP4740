  [Text] A contingent of the task force stationed in Tamale 
was yesterday called upon to observe an imminent attack by a 
group made up of predominantly Dagomba youths on Kokomba 
elements, who are reported to have gone to the Tamale branch of 
the Agricultural Development Bank to transact business. The 
contingent was also called upon to forestall a possible invasion 
of the bank by the group. 
  A statement issued in Accra today by the Ministry of 
Information said attempts to restrain the mob by peaceful means 
failed to bring the situation under control. The contingent was 
therefore compelled to fire warning shots in order to calm the 
situation and to disperse the crowd. Again, this failed and as 
an attack on the contingent itself became imminent, it was 
forced to fire in self-defense resulting in the death of eight 
persons in the crowd while 21 others were injured. 
  The statement said the government deeply regrets the 
incident 
and conveys to the families of the deceased its deepest 
condolences. The government also deplores the latest attack on a 
policeman by a mob in Tamale, as a result of which he is in 
coma. The statement reiterated the government's appeal for 
restraint on the part of all factions involved in the clashes in 
the conflict areas of the Northern region. 
  Meanwhile, a government delegation, led by the minister of 
defense and chairman of the Emergency Committee, Alhaji Mahama 
Iddrisu, is on its way to Tamale to assess the situation. The 
minister of interior, Colonel Osei-Wusu, is also on the 
delegation. 
  [In the same newscast, the radio also carries in its press 
review section, the following related item: "The DAILY GRAPHIC 
and the GHANAIAN TIMES carry reports of a heavy bomb blast last 
Monday at the Korle-Dudo Hawkers' Market within the premises of 
the Kokomba market in Accra. The blast, which observers believe 
is a spillover of the ethnic conflict in the Northern Region, 
seriously injured three persons, who were asleep. A victim of 
the blast alleged that earlier, three persons in military 
uniform came to the market at about 1030 that night and ordered 
children who were playing around the area to leave. According 
to the caretaker of the market, a small boy around the area was 
also found holding a live grenade with the pin intact showing it 
to his mother as a crab he had found."]
