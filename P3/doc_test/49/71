  [Text] Lome, Jan 23 (AFP) - Ghanaian-based "armed elements" 
opened fire on a border post between Lome and the Ghanaian town 
of Aflao late Saturday, a Togolese military source charged here. 
  The attackers, operating just hours before the start of a 
Togolese legislative election campaign, managed to escape in a 
mini- bus before soldiers could return fire, the source said, 
adding that no one had been injured in the shooting. 
  Elections are scheduled for February 6 and 20 and opposition 
parties have expressed fears that the poll will not be organised 
fairly. 
  Earlier this month 67 people were killed in fighting that 
broke out after an attack on Togolese President Gnassingbe 
Eyadema and the barracks where he has his official residence. 
  The government attributed the January 5 attack to opposition 
members in exile in neighbouring Ghana, who it alleged were 
being backed by Ghanaian authorities. 
  Ghanaian leaders have repeatedly denied the allegations and 
on Friday Ghana's foreign minister, Obed Asamoah, warned Togo 
that his country would retaliate if Lome continued to accuse 
Accra of supporting the assassination attempt. 
  "Any future deliberate and unprovoked aggression on Ghana by 
Togo will be met with a commensurate response," Asamoah warned 
during a meeting with diplomats and reporters. "There is an 
extent to which Ghana can be patient to these attacks by Togo."
