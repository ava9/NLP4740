  [Text] Fighting has again broken out between the Komkombas 
and Nanumbas in the Bimbila District of the Northern Region. A 
number of villages in the district have either been burned down 
or deserted. Scores of women and children were seen fleeing to 
Yendi, while men armed themselves and took cover in the bush. 
Students and staff of the EP [Evangelic Presbyterian] Training 
College, as well as workers of the Centralized Government 
Department in the town, have taken refuge at the police station, 
where there are Army and police detachments. 
  The Bimbila District secretary, Mr. Ismael A.D. Adams, has 
briefed the Northern Regional minister, Lieutenant Colonel 
Abdulai Ibrahim, and members of the Regional Security Committee 
who had gone to the area. Mr. Adams told them that reports 
indicate the fighting followed a misunderstanding between a 
Komkomba man and a Nanumba man over the sale of a guinea fowl at 
Napayili market. According to him, the owner of the guinea fowl 
was alleged to have refused the price offered him by the 
Komkomba man and sold it to the Nanumba, and this infuriated the 
Komkomba man who went to the Nanumba man's farm the next day and 
shot two persons. Mr. Adams disclosed that one policeman was 
killed and three others were seriously injured when they 
attempted to evacuate their colleagues from Wulinsi police 
station. He said the situation is purely a Nanumba-Komkomba 
conflict and has nothing to do with the recent attack on Bimbila 
police station. 
  Addressing students of the EP Training College and displaced 
people at Bimbila police station, the regional minister said the 
necessary steps would be taken to solve their problems. He gave 
the assurance that transport would be made available to evacuate 
them from the town as early as possible. The first deputy 
speaker of parliament and MP for Bimbila, Dr. Mohamed Ibn 
Chambas, said the government's attention would be drawn to the 
situation to deal with it promptly.
