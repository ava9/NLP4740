  [Text] Twenty-one shotguns, 73 packets of ammunition, and 
18 ammunition belts have been seized by the police in a raid at 
the Konkomba yam market in Accra. Also seized were two shotguns 
wrapped in a map and concealed under the driver's seat of a 
vehicle. During the operation, a total of 30 suspects were 
rounded up, most of whom are Konkombas. 
  Briefing newsmen after the operation, the greater Accra 
regional police commander, Mr. Joseph Mprah, said the shotguns 
were hidden in the roofs of yam stalls, which also serve as 
residence for the traders at the market. He stated that the 
exercise is the result of information reaching his office that 
the Konkomba market is used as a source of arms supply to the 
north. Mr. Mprah said the inspector general of police, Mr. 
Kwofie, therefore ordered the operation as a way of eliminating 
the source of arms supply and ensuring that all arms are 
retrieved from the warring parties in the conflict. 
  He appealed to arms and ammunition dealers in the country to 
complement the government's efforts for peace by being 
circumspect in their business transactions. He asked them to 
place the national interest above their personal interests and 
refuse the sale of arms to anyone bearing a suspicious permit or 
one with a name belonging to the conflict zone. The exercise 
was later extended to the timber market, where 32 persons were 
arrested for dealing in Indian hemp.
