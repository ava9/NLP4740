  [Text] The president, Flight Lieutenant J.J. Rawlings, left 
Accra today for Namibia on a three-day official visit. He was 
accompanied by his wife, Nana Konadu Agyeman Rawlings; the 
minister of information, Mr. Totobi Quakyi; the Navy commander, 
Rear Admiral Tom Annan; and officials of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs. President Rawlings will attend the official handing 
over of Walvis Bay and the offshore islands to Namibia. It will 
be recalled that at the time of Namibia's independence, South 
Africa refused to hand over two islands to her, claiming that 
they were part of her territory.
