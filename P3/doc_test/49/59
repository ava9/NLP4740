  [Excerpt] Another military officer has been killed and two 
others wounded when an armed group fired at their vehicle at 
Bunjanya near Salaga last Thursday [3 March]. This brings to 
four the number of soldiers killed in the ethnic conflict which 
has been raging for the past six weeks in the Northern Region. 
Lieutenant Colonel Richard Debrah, task force deputy commander 
in charge of operations, said the military vehicle with seven 
soldiers on board was returning to Tamale from Salaga with some 
arms seized in the conflict when it was ambushed and fired on, 
resulting in the death of the officer. When the soldiers 
returned fire the attackers ran into the bush. Lt. Col. Debrah 
said the attack on the vehicle was intended at getting the 
military hardware it was carrying. [passage omitted]
