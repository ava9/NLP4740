  [Text] A state of emergency has been declared in seven 
areas of the Northern Region. This forms part of measures by 
government to restore law and order to the areas engaged in 
ethnic conflict which has resulted in loss of lives and 
property. In a statement to Parliament today, the minister of 
interior, Colonel Osei-Wusu, reiterated government's 
determination to maintain peace in affected areas. 
  [Begin recording] While affirming its commitment to the 
resolution of the conflict through dialogue and negotiation, 
government's immediate concern is to enforce a cessation of 
hostilities and to restore order to enable people go about their 
day to day business. Mr. Speaker, the president, having 
considered the grave dimension that the communal violence has 
taken, has -- in exercise of the powers conferred on him under 
Clause 1 of Article 31 of the Constitution -- declared a state 
of emergency in the following areas of the Northern Region: 
  1. Tamale Municipality; 
  2. Saboba Chereponi District 
  3. Yendi District 
  4. Zabzugu Tatali District, 
  5. Nanumba District 
  6. Gushiago Karaga District, and 
  7. East Gonja District. 
  Mr. Speaker, by Clause 3 of Article 31, Parliament is 
required to decide whether the proclamation of state of 
emergency should remain in force or be revoked. The president 
is of the considered view that the situation requires the 
declaration of state of emergency and I call upon Parliament to 
approve the proclamation. [end recording]
