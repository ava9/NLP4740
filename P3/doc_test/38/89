PEOPLE: SPEED SKATING CHAMP DOESN'T REGRET ROLLING OUT OF THE GAME AT AGE 24 
</P>

Six years ago Tom Peterson, a world champion speed roller-skater, announced his 
retirement from international competition. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson, who lives in Huntington Beach, was recently inducted into the United 
States Amateur/Federation of Roller Skating Hall of Fame in Lincoln, Neb., and 
doesn't regret his decision to leave the sport at age 24. 
</P>
<P>
"That's old for roller-skaters in speed racing," said Peterson. "It's a 
physically and mentally demanding sport. It's for young people." 
</P>
<P>
After growing up as a self-professed "rink rat," Peterson captured seven world 
titles and won gold medals in the Pan American Games. In the early 1980s he was 
considered the top speed roller-skater in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson was a terror in indoor roller rinks in the United States and on the 
outdoor banked tracks in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
"I never could stand losing," said Peterson, "but if I did everything I was 
supposed to in training, there was no way I could see myself losing. I didn't 
lose that many times." 
</P>
<P>
Now president of Hypro Co., Peterson heads a firm that manufactures 
roller-skating wheels in a Huntington Beach plant and sells them in 21 
countries. His built his first wood skate wheels when he was only 9 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his competitive days, Peterson remained an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of stars, and the people in our sport do it for the love of the 
sport," he said. "There was no money in it at all. Sometimes I was so broke and 
hungry I would eat the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great part of my life. I keep drawing back on all the experience I 
had traveling, the different cultures I was exposed to and the different people 
I met." However, like other amateur athletes, he was able to get help from 
sponsors who provided equipment and racing clothes. 
</P>
<P>
The part he doesn't miss is the eight hours of training on most days. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I do miss getting up on the line, hearing the gun and the race 
itself," he said. "I enjoyed it while I was doing it, but not the training." 
</P>
<P>
He won his first national roller-skating title at age 4 and continued to win 
his age category each year thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
But Peterson wasn't exactly a well-known name in athletic circles. 
</P>
<P>
"In my own skating circles I was a star," said Peterson, who liked to compete 
in 1,500 meter races as well as sprints and longer events. 
</P>
<P>
While there are 2,800 rinks in the United States with 40,000 registered 
skaters, Peterson acknowledges that speed skating doesn't enjoy much 
popularity, partly due to the negative image of Roller Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"Roller Derby is like all-star wrestling," he said. "It's just a bunch of hype. 
I don't think any of them can skate." 
</P>
<P>
But times are changing, and speed skating is coming into its own. 
</P>
<P>
"In the next Olympics, (hockey) roller-skating will be a demonstration event," 
said Peterson, who earlier represented roller-skating on the Athletic Advisory 
Council to the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is still able to get in shape to compete, he won't do so for the 
upcoming Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe someday I'll compete in the senior Olympics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Elizabeth A. Johnson, 37, had entered a contest, so her 
fifth-place finish was a good effort, considering it was a national 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
The Mission Viejo woman was awarded $250, and a photo of her re-creation of St. 
Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, made from gingerbread, candy and frosting, was 
printed in this month's edition of Good Housekeeping magazine, the contest 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
"From beginning to end it took me a full month to finish, and that included 
research at the library and the baking itself," said the full-time mother of 
four children. 
</P>
<P>
The competition bug has bitten her. "Next year I'm planning to make a castle 
out of gingerbread," she said.
