communist state's athletics prowess will soon die along with its sponsors

ATHLETES from the former East Germany won nine out of the 10 gold medals for
the victorious German team at the Winter Olympics. This lent weight to
predictions that united Germany will be a world-beating sports superpower.
But trainers and sport club managers in east Germany are pessimistic. 'By
1996 Germany will be lucky to win five gold medals in the winter games,'
says Mr Klaus Schonberger, manager of the TSC sport club in east Berlin.
He said the foundation of the east German sport system, the selection and
training of athletes at an early age, was being rapidly dismantled.
Unlike communist East Germany, which used politicised sport to make its mark
internationally, the Bonn government did not appear to want to use sport for
prestige purposes.
'Democratically elected governments exist for four years and not until the
year 2000 (when Berlin is vying to hold the summer Olympic games),' Mr
Schonberger said.
Several east German trainers have given up on the prospects of competitive
sport in Germany and have gone to coach athletes in the US, Britain and
Austria. Those who remain are mostly unemployed. The sport training centres
which blanketed east Germany were closed down last year when the east German
sport federation DTSB was dissolved.
Mr Schonberger managed to retain a hard core of trainers for his club by
registering them with the Labour Office for a job creation programme. Now
they work for other city agencies but still find time to train athletes.
Disclosures that east Germany's champion sprinter, Katrin Krabbe, and two of
her teammates from the Neubrandenburg sport club falsified their urine
samples in a doping inquiry have led to charges that east German sport was
riddled with malpractices. Mr Schonberger, a former GDR record-holding
hurdler, admitted that trainers worked with researchers in the Institute for
Physical Culture and Sport in Leipzig - ironically, taken over by west
Germany - to develop techniques using drugs for track and field athletes,
swimmers and weightlifters.
Mr Manfred Ewald, the supremo of east German sport, was fully aware of this,
he said. Drug use, however, was no more prevalent in east Germany than in
the west. The essential difference was that while athletes in the west were
individually responsible for taking anabolic drugs, eastern athletes had
little choice if their trainers told them to do so.
The three suspended Neubrandenburg sprinters as well as their club and its
sponsor are under a heavy cloud of suspicion. But club athletes and
residents of Neubrandenburg demonstratively support the young women. Several
of them suggested there was a western 'plot' against east German athletes.
While east German athletes quickly adapted to commercialised sport in the
west, many of them believe it is short-sighted even from the standpoint of
sponsors. Jacqueline Borner, who trains at TSC and won the gold medal at the
Winter Olympics in the 1,500 metre speed skating event, complained that
sponsors were only interested in promoting top-performing athletes but not
in backing promising young talent. Thus a leading German car manufacturer
handed out cars 'left and right' to top athletes but did little to support
the essential training of juniors.
One of the reasons the east German sport machine worked so well is that it
provided incentives for athletes. An Olympic gold medal was worth 20,000
Marks, silver 15,000 Marks and bronze 10,000 Marks, although not much could
be bought for the money. Much more important was the opportunity to buy a
car without waiting ten years or to get a new flat.
The opportunity to travel was also an important inducement. The only others
allowed to travel to the west were pensioners.
Mr Ewald, whose east Berlin flat is filled with souvenirs of his travels as
president of the DTSB, proudly recalled that he convinced Mr Erich Honecker,
the East German leader, that top athletes, their wives and husbands,
trainers and masseurs should be rewarded with cruises to Cuba and the
Mediterranean.
As the principal architect of the East German sport machine, Mr Ewald, a
member of the party's central committee, was convinced it was one of the
best investments the leadership made.
Although he is relentlessly attacked by the German media over drugs use as
well as for allegedly allowing the Stasi security police to harass athletes,
he denies any wrongdoing. Mr Ewald insists that ordinary east Germans, who
were sport-mad under the communist system, still believed in him although
they had lost their faith in socialism.
