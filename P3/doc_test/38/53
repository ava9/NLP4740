Most ski resorts like to boast their season runs from Thanksgiving to Easter or 
beyond, but more often than not, they have to hedge a bit. That opening date 
frequently turns out to be a turkey. 
</P>
<P>
This year, at least, the Southland and the Rocky Mountains are right on 
schedule, but most of the Sierra will experience a balmy and dry holiday 
weekend -- without all those skiers cluttering up the highways. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Bernardino Mountains, where Snow Summit and Bear Mountain are 
already in operation, Snow Valley made about 16 inches of snow Wednesday, to go 
with four inches that fell naturally, and began its season Thursday. Chairlifts 
Nos. 6, 7 and 13 are running for beginning and intermediate skiers. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain High, near Wrightwood, has also had its snow guns firing away and said 
it hopes to be open by today. 
</P>
<P>
An early-week storm dropped up to eight inches of snow in the Sierra, but that 
was hardly enough to incite widespread jubilation. Mammoth Mountain, for 
example, said it still needs 18 to 24 inches more. 
</P>
<P>
So, the only lift-served skiing definitely available within a couple hundred 
miles of Lake Tahoe this weekend will be at Boreal, which has been open since 
Nov. 2, and Alpine Meadows, where snow-making has covered the runs under the 
Kangaroo chairlift and the Tiegel surface lift. Alpine, incidentally, stayed 
open last season until Mother's Day, May 13. 
</P>
<P>
Northstar was also making snow furiously Wednesday night and called an opening 
today "possible." 
</P>
<P>
Utah has perhaps the best skiing in the West at the moment, after receiving up 
to 30 inches of powder Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Snowbird opened Thursday, Alta today. They join Brighton, which reported a 
39-inch depth Wednesday; Solitude, which has 34 inches, and Park City, where 
the U.S. Pro Tour gets under way this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Deer Valley, completing a $6-million expansion program, is planning a Dec. 1 
lift-off. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado has also picked up some new snow, and virtually all of the state's 
major resorts began operating on at least a limited basis Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mt. Bachelor, Ore., opened Wednesday with depths ranging from six to 16 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Taos Ski Valley, N.M., began operation Thursday with about 60% of its runs 
skiable on a 24-inch base. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In British Columbia, Whistler Mountain launched its season Thursday, 
linking its lifts, as usual, with neighboring Blackcomb, which got going last 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sun Valley, Ida., has announced a Dec. 7 starting date.
