BUTH READIES FOR COLLEGE WRESTLING BY ADDING POUNDS -- AND VICTORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dwayne Buth, the state high school wrestling champion at 161 pounds, recently 
went on a strict diet. 
</P>
<P>
"I basically try to eat everything in sight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
OK, sort of strict. Buth recently accepted a scholarship to Cal State 
Fullerton, and he knows that if he is to continue his wrestling success in 
college, he will have to add bulk and strength. 
</P>
<P>
He now weighs about 185, with most of the added pounds coming from a protein 
mixture that he drinks three to four times a day. His work in the weight room 
hasn't hurt, either. 
</P>
<P>
Buth is not only trying to eat everything in sight; he is also trying to win 
everything in sight. To that end, he added to his state championship by taking 
the gold medal at 191 pounds Saturday in the California State Games at Serra 
High School. He was one of 12 area wrestlers to finish among the top four in 
their class. 
</P>
<P>
Buth's gold came after he won by a decision over Brian Tomazic of Santa Clara, 
4-0, in the title bout. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I needed that match for confidence to wrestle against bigger guys," 
Buth said. "I needed the work for when I go to Fullerton." 
</P>
<P>
The only wrestler to pin Buth during the high school season, Shawn Diamond, 
also took home a gold medal and helped San Diego County earn second place as a 
team with 63 total points. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara topped the field with 77 points. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond, who graduated from San Dieguito last spring, took first at 175 pounds 
(he wrestled at 161 in high school) by pinning his final-round opponent, John 
Sanchez of Santa Clara, after taking him down with a half-nelson less than two 
minutes into the match. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond is 6-feet-4, which is noteworthy because his height makes his 
half-nelson all the more powerful. 
</P>
<P>
"They (opponents) are a lot stronger than I am," Diamond said. "But for some 
moves, like my half-nelson, my height makes it hard to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Diamond pinned three opponents in Saturday's tournament, all the result of 
half-nelsons. He pinned 32 opponents during the year, all with the same move. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Castillo 105 pounds) was the only other San Diego All-Star to strike 
gold. He won by decision against Mitch Guzman from San Joaquin Valley, 6-4, in 
his title match. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Reding (123) and David O'Leary (275) were San Diego's second-place 
wrestlers; Tony Matteucci (165), Dale Hanover (132) and Craig Threlfall (220) 
won third-place medals; and Matt McSweeney (154), Quincy Clark (165) and Erik 
Johnson (220) were fourth-place finishers. 
</P>
<P>
ROLLER SKATING 
</P>
<P>
The winner in the men's senior roller skating division, Jay Etheredge, 26, of 
Milpitas, says he regularly gets up to speeds in excess of 25 miles an hour. He 
can do 100-meter sprints -- around ovals -- in 9.8 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
But don't make the mistake of asking Etheredge for his winning time. 
</P>
<P>
"Times are irrelevant," he'll tell you. "It's more of a cat-and-mouse type of 
race. It's just like cycling, or anything that has to do with drafting." 
</P>
<P>
Etheredge should know -- he has been the Southwest States champion in nine of 
the past 10 years, an accomplishment that goes rather unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
Like the California Games themselves, speed skaters are fighting for publicity. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get our sport recognized by the Olympics and we feel this 
(skating in the California Games) is a step in that direction," said Ken 
Shelton, the event director. "It'll probably be a demonstration sport in the 
1996 Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Slam-N-Jam team has made it to the title game of the boys 
18-and-under tournament after handing Carson B-Ball a 79-75 defeat. Carson, 
however, will also be in the gold-medal game because it came back after losing 
to San Diego, defeating Team Avia, 79-73, to earn a spot in the championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Today's game is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. at Grossmont College.
