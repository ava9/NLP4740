East German leader Erich Honecker was so infatuated with figure skater Katarina 
Witt that he made it plain to the government-sponsored newspapers that they 
could gain favor with him by publishing her picture as often as possible. 
</P>
<P>
In their recent eight-part series on sports in East Germany, West German 
newspapers Bild and Bild am Sonntag also reported that East German government 
officials arranged several meetings between Witt, a two-time Olympic gold 
medalist, and ski jumper Jens Weissflog, an Olympic gold and silver medalist in 
1984, in hopes that they would fall in love, marry and bear athletic children. 
</P>
<P>
But Hans-Georg Aschenbach, an East German ski jumper who defected to West 
Germany last August, told Bild that Witt and Weissflog were not attracted to 
each other. Weissflog was engaged to another woman, and Witt lived with a 
drummer in a rock band. 
</P>
<P>
The East Germans have not had much success in the lonely hearts department. 
Swimmers Roland Matthes and Kornelia Ender, who, between them, won eight gold, 
six silver and two bronze medals in three Olympics, married in 1978. But, 
according to Bild am Sonntag, their model marriage soon dissolved. They had one 
child, who is mentally retarded. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that Ender, who was East Germany's most popular female 
athlete before Witt, later was banished to Suhl, a remote village in the 
country's southwestern corner. 
</P>
<P>
As an indication of the quality of life there, the joke in East Germany is that 
Suhl stands for Socialist Underprivileged Hinterland. That was Ender's 
punishment, Bild am Sonntag reported, for writing anti-government letters to 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
Ender is now married to a former bobsledder, who was identified as the 
ringleader after he and his teammates were involved in a scandal, Bild am 
Sonntag said. A search of the bobsledders' hotel rooms, which was ordered after 
they were seen attending a forbidden movie, "Rambo II," on a trip to the West, 
yielded Western currency, clothing, addresses and pornography. While the other 
bobsledders were reprimanded, Ender's husband was removed from the team.
