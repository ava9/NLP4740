<P>
It's all downhill at the World Alpine Ski Championships for the rest of this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Competitors from every major skiing nation in the world -- and some not so 
major -- made their first official training runs down the high-speed courses at 
Vail and Beaver Creek Tuesday, and as usual, it was difficult to tell which 
racers were going all out and which were just trying to get the feel of the 
best line, or applying the brakes at the bottom to sandbag their times. 
</P>
<P>
However, Pam Fletcher of the U.S. ski team, who obviously likes the course on 
Vail Mountain, showed that she will be a threat in the regular women's downhill 
Sunday when she posted the second fastest time in the afternoon, after being 
eighth in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, who turned 26 Monday, won a World Cup downhill here in 1986 and 
finished third in '87. She broke her right leg in a collision with a course 
worker just before the '88 Olympic downhill at Calgary and has been slow in 
regaining her form. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said Tuesday: "I'm skiing the best I can right now. The knee isn't 
perfect, but it's not really bothering me either. I'll just give it all I've 
got." 
</P>
<P>
The men's course at Beaver Creek drew conflicting comments from the Swiss 
skiers who finished 1-2 at Calgary. Peter Mueller, the silver medalist, said 
that the organizers had taken out too many bumps since last March's World Cup 
race and claimed, "It's too easy now." 
</P>
<P>
But Pirmin Zurbriggen, the Olympic gold medalist, disagreed, saying, "It's 
good, I like it. They took the bumps out of the flats, but there are still 
plenty of other jumps." 
</P>
<P>
Zurbriggen hopes to be able to ski faster than his main rival, Marc Girardelli 
of Luxembourg, in the men's combined downhill Friday and take the combined 
medal, although Girardelli holds a comfortable lead after Monday's combined 
slalom. Girardelli was third in the slalom and Zurbriggen 11th, but the 
difference in their times was only .78 of a second, not an insurmountable 
margin under the complicated scoring system used to determine combined 
placings. 
</P>
<P>
The two will also be among the favorites in the regular men's downhill 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's combined event, which will wind up with the combined downhill 
Thursday, Vreni Schneider of Switzerland, who has been nearly invincible in 
World Cup technical events so far this winter, will be trying to hold off the 
challenge of America's Tamara McKinney. 
</P>
<P>
They were 1-2 in the combined slalom, separated by just .12 of a second, and 
were relatively close to each other in Tuesday's downhill practice times. 
</P>
<P>
Downhill training will continue today for both men and women. 
</P>
<P>
A huge turnout of spectators is expected to make the trip through the 
Eisenhower Tunnel and over Vail Pass from Denver for the two regular downhill 
races this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the schedule calls for the women's slalom Monday, the men's super-G 
Tuesday, the women's super-G next Wednesday and the men's giant slalom next 
Thursday, followed by an open day. The women's giant slalom and the men's 
slalom are set for the final weekend, Feb. 11-12. 
</P>
<P>
The organizing committee announced Tuesday that no safety violations were 
involved Monday in the accidental death of the Duke of Cadiz, Alfonso de Borbon 
of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
However, Eagle County Sheriff A.J. Johnson refused to support or refute those 
contentions until he completes his investigation of the accident. Johnson said 
that the investigation would take about one month. 
</P>
<P>
The duke, 52, a first cousin of King Juan Carlos of Spain and an official of 
the International Skiing Federation (FIS), was killed when he skied into cables 
supporting the finish banner at the bottom of the men's downhill course at 
Beaver Creek.
