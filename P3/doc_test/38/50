Tucked away on a shelf at 9,600 feet in the southern Wasatch Mountains, this 
place is perhaps the best-kept secret in western skiing. 
</P>
<P>
It's not Snowbird or Park City, the state's two world-class resorts, but then 
it's not 750 miles from Los Angeles, either. It's about 475, all except the 
last 16 via four-lane Interstate 15. That's the same mileage Southland skiers 
must drive to reach Lake Tahoe, a trip with several stretches of two-lane 
passing roulette, plus four snowy summits. 
</P>
<P>
"Skiers arrive here on a weekend from Southern California or Las Vegas and say, 
'Wow, there's nobody around,' " marketing director Julie Amsden said. "Then 
they try to keep it to themselves because they don't want the crowds to come 
and spoil everything." 
</P>
<P>
Still relatively unspoiled are 500 acres of ski terrain on two mountains with a 
top elevation of 11,000 feet, served by seven chairlifts and covered by Utah's 
famous powder. About 45% of the runs are intermediate, 35% advanced and 20% 
beginner. Cross-country skiers can choose from a number of trails, including 
the scenic route to Cedar Breaks National Monument and back. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring, Brian Head is an especially attractive destination for a ski 
week because of the opportunity to add a little sightseeing in nearby Zion and 
Bryce Canyon national parks. Then there's always Las Vegas to break -- in more 
ways than one -- the monotony of the eight-hour drive across the desert and 
mountains, either coming or going. 
</P>
<P>
But skiing has been the principal attraction here since the Navajo lift was 
opened in January 1965. The Giant Steps Lodge across the road, with four lifts, 
came later, and Brian Head Station, with two more lifts around the bend, is the 
most recent addition. A free shuttle-bus service connects the three base areas. 
</P>
<P>
On a sunny Sunday recently, there were only about 2,000 skiers scattered over 
the slopes and inside the lodges. Lift lines were non-existent. At $22, the 
all-day ticket is priced reasonably; Snowbird and Park City charge $32 tops, 
but of course, they're both bigger than Brian Head. 
</P>
<P>
Base depths currently range between four and five feet, following a slightly 
later-than-usual start this winter. Although the big resorts near Salt Lake 
City were open by Thanksgiving, Brian Head remained just south of the jet 
stream and didn't get enough snow to start operating until the Tuesday before 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd had two good years in a row before that, so it was a bit deflating to 
have to sit around while others were skiing," Amsden said. 
</P>
<P>
Also somewhat deflating has been the current status of Brian Head Enterprises, 
which is undergoing Chaper 11 reorganization, according to Amsden. 
</P>
<P>
"It has caused some problems," she said. "But skiers aren't being affected, and 
we're fortunate to have a trustee who understands the ski business. Rene Meyer, 
the boss now, has been an executive at both Sun Valley (Ida.) and Snowbird." 
</P>
<P>
Overnight accommodations are separate from the ski operation, and there is a 
mix of hotels and condominium units supplying beds for about 4,000 skiers in 
the town of Brian Head. Additional lodging is available in Parowan, at the 
junction of Interstate 15 and Utah 143, and in Cedar City, 32 miles away. Cedar 
City also has an airport that is projected as a future gateway for commuter 
airline connections with Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Apres-ski activity is limited mainly to a few restaurants, including a new 
gourmet spot called The Junction in Brian Head Station. Utah's liquor laws are 
somewhat obscure to most visitors, but the bottom line seems to be that it's OK 
to drink with a meal, or if you go through the fiction of paying nominal dues 
to join a "club." 
</P>
<P>
Southern Utah is known upstate as Dixie, also as "Color Country." It's usually 
10 to 30 degrees warmer down here, but old Brian Head hands are hoping, 
probably in vain, that it doesn't become a skiing hot spot.

Skiing Notes 
</P>

A 30-member panel selected Marc Hodler, longtime president of the International 
Ski Federation (FIS), as the seventh winner of the AT&amp;T Skiing Award, given 
annually to an individual "whose commitment to excellence and dedication to 
skiing has profoundly enriched the sport." The other finalists were Jean-Claude 
Killy, France's 1968 triple Olympic gold medalist, and Andrea Mead Lawrence, 
1952 double Olympic gold medalist, who lives in Mammoth Lakes. Previous winners 
included Bob Beattie, Jimmy Heuga, Serge Lang, Billy Kidd, Warren Miller and 
the late Willy Schaeffler.

Girardelli of Luxembourg has all but clinched his third men's overall title 
with 358 points, 116 more than three-time champion Pirmin Zurbriggen of

Doug Pfeiffer, "father of freestyle skiing" and former editor of Skiing 
magazine, is again teaching his Pfeiffer's Pfun Class at Snow Summit, and he 
says, "Anybody capable of making half-fast christies is invited to enroll" and 
learn some new tricks. . . . Buzz Bainbridge, a longtime New Mexico ski 
executive in various capacities, was the guest of honor Friday night in Santa 
Fe, N.M., during the weekend-long WinterFestival, celebrating 50 years of 
skiing there. . . . More than 35,000 beginners turned out at 260 ski areas 
around the country on "National Learn-to-Ski Day" last month, according to the 
sponsoring National Ski Areas Assn. and Ski Industries America. . . . 
"Free-Heel Skiing," a recently published book by Paul Parker, tells 
cross-country skiers all they need to know about telemark turns and how to 
apply Alpine parallel techniques so they can ski anywhere, in all conditions.
