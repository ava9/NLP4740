Malawi's President Hastings Kamuzu Banda and his party last night appeared
to be trailing well behind his opponents as unofficial results came in from
the country's first multi-party elections on Tuesday, Reuter reports from
Blantyre.
Official results are not expected until today, largely because of delays in
counting ballot papers but the opposition United Democratic Front, a
grouping of former Banda aides expelled from his ruling Malawi Congress
Party, claimed victory in the parliamentary polls.
'I think it is time the MCP conceded defeat,' UDF secretary-general Harry
Thomson told a news conference.
He said ballot counts by the UDF showed the party had captured 69 of the 177
contested parliamentary seats, the MCP 52 and another opposition party, the
Alliance for Democracy (Aford) 34. State radio gave the UDF 56 seats, Aford
32 and the MCP 25. In the presidential poll, the radio said UDF leader
Bakili Muluzi had 961,980 votes, President Banda 418,222 and Aford leader
Chakufwa Chihana 436,860.
Mr Thomson said Mr Muluzi was confident of unseating Mr Banda in the
presidential poll but would not make any announcement until he had obtained
official results.
'Barring some miracle, he is out,' a veteran African diplomat said.
President Banda led the nation to independence from Britain in 1964 and ran
a harsh regime for 30 years. He is now in his 90s and unwell since
undergoing brain surgery last year. His grip on power began to slip two
years ago under mounting pressure from the west and internal dissent over
his human rights record.
