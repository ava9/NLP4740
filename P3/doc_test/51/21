  [Text] Talks have been continuing between the UDF [United 
Democratic Front] and Aford [Alliance for Democracy]. Aford won 
all the seats in northern Malawi, but trailed behind the UDF 
with 33 to the UDF's 84. They need an alliance to take on the 
old ruling MCP [Malawi Congress Party] which has 55 seats in the 
assembly. But there were reports that Aford was unhappy with the 
three junior ministries that had been offered by Bakili Muluzi. 
On the line to Malawi, Mary Harper asked Aford's Secretary 
General Dr. (Meke Mchewa) how the talks were going. 
  [Begin recording] [(Mchewa]) The talks are going very well, 
I 
should say, and that the invitation when offered to Aford for a 
discussion in Blantyre two days ago, at least, we -- Aford -- 
accepted those [as heard] in the goodwill and spirit in which 
they were intended. 
  [Harper] But things don't really seem to be going very well 
at all. You were offered three ministries by the UDF in the new 
government and you refused them? 
  [(Mchewa]) We have not said no to that. That is a position 
yet which has to be (?briefed) to our president and our 
president was only briefed yesterday by some members of the 
delegation, but not the entire team. 
  [Harper] So, what is it exactly that Aford wants? 
  [(Mchewa] No, I think the question must be what is it 
exactly 
that the UDF wants. I think that has been our question to them 
and they are unable to define it. 
  [Harper] What about the question of ministries? How many 
would you be satisfied with? 
  [(Mchewa]) They have a [words indistinct] and they are the 
ones who formed the government. We know that they have so many 
[words indistinct] with. We are being invited to be careful and 
I don't think we can dictate the terms of [words indistinct] to 
them. That offer was made to us. We should be in a position to 
say whether or not indeed it does meet the minimum of a decent 
relationship to occur. 
  [Harper] Now, what has become of your party leader, Chakufwa 
Chihana? He seems to have completely disappeared? 
  [(Mchewa] Not at all. He is well and alive and doing 
absolutely well by [words indistinct] and doing at least the 
normal thing that he has missed doing as a family [words 
indistinct] productive man in these past few months. [end 
recording]
