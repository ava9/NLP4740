  [Text] Hundreds of people who claim that they suffered 
abuse during President Kamuzu Banda's three decades in office 
have banded together to demand compensation and an investigation 
into their complaints. The alleged victims are mainly political 
exiles, prisoners, and members of the Jehovah's Witness 
religious sect forced into exile into neighboring countries when 
their church was banned by the Government of Malawi in the 
1970s. Property running into millions of dollars was seized 
from members of the sect and taken over by the governing Malawi 
Congress Party or its now disbanded militia, the Malawi Young 
Pioneers. A former exile and now member of the opposition 
United Front for Multiparty Democracy, Mr. Frank Jiya, said that 
compensation would be seen as a symbol of apology and 
reconciliation to those who had suffered.
