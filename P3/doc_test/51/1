  [Text] Blantyre, May 29 (AFP) -- Malawi's outspoken trade 
unionist and opposition leader, Chakufwa Chihana, has accused 
President Bakili Muluzi of failing to unite the country, divided 
on regional lines since May 17 general elections. 
  Chihana, leader of the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD), who 
was in third place in the presidential elections, said Muluzi 
had done nothing to unite the country, state radio reported 
Sunday [29 May]. 
  Speaking to reporters in the northern district of Rumphi, 
where he has his powerbase, Chihana called for unity talks 
between Muluzi and ex-president Kamuzu Banda and himself. 
  The densely-populated south voted overwhelmingly for Muluzi 
who comes from a southern district of Machinga, while the thinly 
populated north voted for Chihana, and Banda drew his votes from 
the central region, where he comes from -- setting the scene for 
regional division. 
  "People voted because Muluzi or Chihana comes from that 
area," said Muluzi last week, worried that his ruling United 
Democratic Front (UDF) party did not win any parliamentary seat 
in the north. 
  Coalition talks between Muluzi's party and AFORD collapsed 
last week. UDF have ruled out any coalition with Banda's Malawi 
Congress Party. 
  UDF, which won 84 of the 177 parliamentary seats, has formed 
a minority government after failing to secure at least 89 seats 
to make 51 percent of the working majority in parliament. 
  AFORD with 36 seats and the MCP with 55, make a stronger 
opposition in parliament with 91 votes.
