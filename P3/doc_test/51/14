<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] There were signs of growing disagreement among 
leaders of Malawi's Aford [Alliance for Democracy] opposition 
party, which came second in last month's elections won by the 
United Democratic Front [UDF] of President Bakili Muluzi. 
Yesterday, on this program, one of Aford's founder member, 
Victor Ndove, criticized the party's leader, Chakufwa Chihana, 
both for his personal style and for his handling of negotiations 
with the UDF over the formation of the new government. He even 
accused the Aford leadership of holding talks with the ousted 
Malawi Congress Party, the MCP. On the Line to Mangochi, Chris 
Greene asked Aford's Secretary General Dr. (Mucky Mtewa) how he 
responded to Victor Ndove's criticism. 
  [Begin recording] [(Mtewa)] First, of course, on a personal 
note, I have tremendous respect for my good friend Victor Ndove. 
In responding to the concern of the good founder, is that, of 
course, the position taken by President Chakufwa Chihana, on 
behalf of this party, in wanting to preserve the integrity of 
his members in parliament, and of course, definitely, the 
intricate structure of consultation within the Alliance for 
Democracy, was to make sure that everything else, as much as 
possible, was democratically conducted and that we were giving 
away the party or delivering our members in parliament to the 
UDF government, without knowing precisely the conditions and 
terms which would be acceptable to our members within the party. 
  [Greene] But, in fact, you failed to negotiate yourselves 
into the governing coalition and you are now just a minor 
opposition party. 
  [(Mtewa)] No, that is not...[pauses] I think I must have 
said 
about 48 hours ago that the negotiations and the talking still 
continue and nothing has been terminated yet, contrary to those 
perceptions. 
  [Greene] Is it true that you are also negotiating with the 
former ruling MCP party? 
  [(Mtewa)] Negotiating would be the wrong term. I am not sure 
what we are negotiating about. I think we are talking to all 
individuals in the country, as Malawians, given the (?need for) 
the preservation of the delicate balance of democracy in this 
country. On matters of common interest, should those happen to 
coincide at all in the debate on legislation introduced by 
government, we will be expected to consult and talk to those 
other members of the other party on how best to approach those 
issues of common interest. Talking now, of course, is purely a 
matter of friendship. They are both friends and that they were 
never enemies. They just happened to be members in the 
government at the time, as, I am sure, the UDF gentlemen 
happened to be members of that government for many years. 
  [Greene] That is a very conciliatory language from you, 
given 
the sorts of things that Chakufwa Chihana said after he came out 
of prison? 
  [(Mtewa)] Definitely, also conciliatory in terms of the 
personal life of this secretary general. For the record, of 
course, both my parents are crippled by the Malawi Congress 
Party government. I think you can say, at least, in politics we 
grow fast and we learn the hard way. [end recording]
