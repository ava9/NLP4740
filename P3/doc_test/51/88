A MALAWI magistrates court yesterday charged dissident Chakufwa Chihana with
three counts of sedition and freed him on bail unconditionally, his lawyer
said, Reuter reports from Lusaka.
Mr Bazuka Mhango told Reuters that Mr Chihana, who attended the court in the
northern town of Zomba, was in good health and heading towards Malawi's
capital.
'He has been charged with three offences related to sedition but we applied
for bail and the magistrate ordered that he be released. He is now on his
way home,' Mr Mhango said.
The charges stem from statements Mr Chihana, 52, made in a July interview
with the BBC shortly after his release from detention on earlier sedition
charges.
He had said he would continue to mobilise popular support to end the
one-party rule of Mr Kamuzu Banda, self-declared life president who has held
power since 1964 independence from Britain.
Banda, accused last week of continued human rights abuses by Amnesty
International, says he still enjoys wide support.
Chihana is expected to appear in court on September 21 in connection with
the first sedition charges following his return to Malawi from meetings in
Lusaka with exiles last April.
He was re-arrested shortly after his release in July 10.
