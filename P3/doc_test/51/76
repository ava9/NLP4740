  [Text] Malawi President Bakili Muluzi has already returned 
home from his first visit abroad since his election. He was in 
Maputo for a few hours for talks with Mozambican officials. 
President Chissano described the visit as one of courtesy. 
Journalists who were at the airport to cover the departure of 
the Malawian head of state wanted to know what solution had been 
found to resolve the question of the Malawi Young Pioneers 
[MYP]. President Chissano said: 
  [Begin recording] [Chissano] Our plan is to avoid any 
friction that could lead to a violent or armed dispute, 
regardless of the reasons that prompted the MYP to come to 
Mozambique. They should rest assured that they may return home 
in peace. The Malawian Government will receive them and give 
them protection. Actually, I do not know whether they have 
started to go back home. In view of the prevailing calm in 
Malawi, it is possible that some of them... [pause] if they left 
their country because they were afraid, it could be that they 
have begun going back home. If there are other reasons, then I 
cannot comment. [end recording] 
  Afonso Dhlakama's Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] 
says it should take part in discussions about the MYP issue 
because there have been accusations that MYP members are in 
Renamo bases. President Chissano comments: 
  [Begin recording] [Chissano] Obviously, I think there is no 
interest in discussing this issue because if MYP members were at 
Renamo bases, Renamo would not give us proof of that. That is 
not what matters. What matters is that MYP members should 
return home. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Do you not want to involve 
Renamo in the discussions? 
  [Chissano] Renamo is free to contact the Malawian 
Government. 
If Renamo has no MYP members in its bases, than all the better. 
The information we have say they are there [words indistinct] 
so, it is not up to us to prove that they are there. All we can 
do is to say that we have information about the MYP. What 
matters for us is that MYP members return home. Their country is 
willing to receive them. So, if Renamo has no MYP members, we 
have no problems with that. If Renamo has them, then it should 
help us to remove them. [end recording] 
  President Chissano said a number of Renamo members have been 
involved with the MYP. He did not rule out Renamo's 
responsibility over the issue. This is a controversial issue 
about which President Muluzi only said that officially he had no 
knowledge of the situation. Will the issue be ever known fully? 
  Today's talks also dealt with bilateral cooperation. 
  [Begin Chissano recording] We noted that it was necessary to 
activate the cooperation and security commissions. The security 
commission now has a different role to play because both sides 
no longer suspect one another. The idea is to create peace in 
the two countries and to contribute to peace in the region. The 
commission will meet not only to discuss the MYP issue, but also 
peace in general. The cooperation commission will discuss trade 
along the border area to make it a formal activity, serving the 
two sides. I have suggested that efforts should be made to 
complete the last 73 km of the Nacala railroad by raising 
financial assistance. The cooperation commission will discuss 
other issues. [end recording] 
  There are prospects of good cooperation between the two 
countries. President Chissano noted that past problems were 
with the previous government and not with the people of Malawi.
