Malawi voted by almost two to one to endorse multi-party democracy. Results
yesterday from a referendum on Monday delivered a stinging snub to
repressive President Kamuzu Banda, and thousands took to the streets in
celebration, Our Foreign Staff writes.
Dr Banda, who has run the country since independence from Britain in 1964,
called the poll under pressure from donors. The opposition will now press
for speedy installation of a multi-party transitional government to draw up
a democratic constitution and elections by the end of the year.
Mr Chakufwa Chihana, leader of the opposition Aford group who was freed from
jail last Saturday after serving six months for sedition, said Dr Banda's
days in power were now numbered. 'There is no way Banda can be resurrected.'
