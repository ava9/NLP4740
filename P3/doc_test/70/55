Nobody wants to play the Detroit Pistons in the best-of-five series that opens 
the playoffs in the National Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons aren't just the team with the best record in the league, they are 
the team coming up to the playoffs with the most momentum. 
</P>
<P>
In the first round the Pistons figure to play either Philadelphia or Boston. 
</P>
<P>
That's one of the reasons why the 76ers and Celtics engaged in a playoff-type 
game Tuesday night at Philadelphia. The team that finishes with the seventh 
best record in the East plays New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics, who went into the game 1 1/2 games behind the 76ers, have a poor 
road record and were without injured Kevin McHale, but it still took the best 
of Charles Barkley for the 76ers to pull out a 117-115 overtime victory. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley had 27 points, 12 rebounds and three steals in another superb 
performance. He made a dunk with 27 seconds left in regulation to tie the 
score, 102-102. Then, he made a free throw with 34 seconds left in the extra 
period and it proved decisive, forcing Dennis Johnson to miss a free throw on 
purpose with two seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics, who have played almost the entire season without their best 
player, Larry Bird, now have McHale out with a foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
Although they didn't win, the Celtics still have 14 games remaining and they 
are playing better than the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
Especially encouraging is the play of youngsters Reggie Lewis and rookie Brian 
Shaw. Lewis had a career-high 39 points, while Shaw, the 6-foot-6 guard from UC 
Santa Barbara, had 18 points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
A rookie also was big for the 76ers. Hersey Hawkins had eight of his 21 points 
in the five-minute overtime. His three-point basket with 1:24 left in overtime 
gave the 76ers a four-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 111, Atlanta 108 -- The Nets, beaten by Miami by 21 points Monday 
night, turned on the Hawks in this game at East Rutherford, N.J., to end a 
10-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Hinson scored six of his 25 points in the last two minutes to give the 
lowly Nets their first win against the Hawks after 16 consecutive defeats. 
</P>
<P>
It was Hinson's 10-foot jumper with 14 seconds left that clinched the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The stunning loss dropped the Hawks two games behind Chicago in the battle for 
fourth place in the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 130, Washington 114 -- With a chance to close in on the Celtics in 
their try for the final playoff spot in the East, the Bullets played one of 
their poorest games. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Anderson scored 29 points and Alvin Robertson 28 to lead the weak Spurs 
to just their 19th victory in 69 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs went to the front early and seemed to get better after Coach Larry 
Brown was ejected after picking up two technicals in the second quarter. They 
soared to a 23-point lead in the third quarter before easing off. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 115, Golden State 106 -- Every time Michael Jordan sets a goal, he 
accomplishes it. First, he decided to become a scoring champ and he did that 
with ease. 
</P>
<P>
Then last year he decided to become the best defensive player. He did. 
</P>
<P>
After Bulls' Coach Doug Collins decided his team would be better with Jordan at 
the point guard instead of the shooting guard, Jordan had a new goal -- -- to 
become the best playmaker. 
</P>
<P>
Although he's been at it for only 10 games, Jordan has already served notice to 
John Stockton and Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, in this game at Chicago, scored 33 points and has his second 
consecutive triple-double as the Bulls won their fifth in a row. The previous 
four were at the conclusion of a trip West. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan had 12 rebounds and 11 assists as the Bulls handed the Warriors their 
fourth consecutive defeat and seventh in a row on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors built a 52-47 lead late in the third quarter but Horace Grant 
scored on a turnaround jumper that ignited a 19-4 spurt that put the Bulls in 
command. 
</P>
<P>
New York 128, Portland 124 -- Mark Jackson, just recently returned after knee 
surgery, had a triple-double at New York and Kiki Vandeweghe, in his first game 
against his old mates, had 24 points to lead the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson had 21 of his 27 points in the second half to hold off the determined 
Trail Blazers. He also had 10 rebounds and 12 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 120, Seattle 117 -- Akeem Olajuwon scored 17 of his 36 points in the 
pivotal fourth quarter at Houston and the Rockets needed them all to hold off 
the SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
The other Rockets scored only seven points in the 12 minutes against the 
Sonics. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 102, Dallas 90 -- Almost every other team has been hammering the 
hapless Mavericks lately, but the Cavaliers struggled for more than a half at 
Richfield, Ohio before handing Dallas its 11th consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Harper saved them. He scored 15 of his points in a 26-11 spurt late in the 
third quarter that broke open a close game. DAN HAFNER
