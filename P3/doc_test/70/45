The Detroit Pistons are so talented and well-balanced that the same player 
rarely leads them in scoring two games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
They have developed a knack for finding one or more hot shooters whenever they 
are needed. 
</P>
<P>
What does stay constant, though, is the defense. 
</P>
<P>
The two-time NBA champions ran their winning streak to nine games and improved 
their record to 12-2 Wednesday night at Auburn Hills, Mich., with a 90-83 
victory over the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
It was James Edwards' turn to lead the scoring. The veteran power forward had 
22 points and sank a couple of key baskets down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the defense took control. The slumping Knicks, who have lost four in 
a row, played the Pistons to a 52-52 standstill at halftime. But in the second 
half the Knicks scored only 31 points and, despite a Detroit cold spell in the 
fourth quarter, never really had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons led, 77-66, going into the final 12 minutes but failed to get a 
point in seven consecutive trips down the court. Their tough defense, however, 
let the Knicks get no closer than six points despite the Pistons' 13-point 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good thing we played great defense in the second half," Coach Chuck 
Daly said, "because we couldn't get any shots. We had six 24-second violations, 
which shows you just how good their defense was." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards was expecting a good night. "Charles Oakley is a fine player, but at 
6-9, he's too short," the seven-footer said. "I can go over the top of him." 
</P>
<P>
Miami 97, New Jersey 79 -- Maybe winning three games in a row made the Nets 
overconfident. Whatever, they didn't come to Miami ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
They shot a season-low 36% from the field but still trailed by only four points 
until late in the third period when Heat rookie Willie Burton triggered a 9-0 
run that broke it open. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 110, Cleveland 108 -- The Warriors are a much better team with 
Mitch Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
In his second game back from a sprained ankle, Richmond scored 24 points and 
made a key rebound in the closing seconds at Richfield, Ohio, to end the 
Warriors' three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Hardaway had 23 points and 17 assists for the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 118, Washington 94 -- Michael Jordan started out at Chicago as if he 
were on his way to one of his 50-point games. He had 15 points in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But high-scoring games are not that important to the Bulls' star these days. 
With the Bulls building a 39-26 lead, Jordan spent most of the rest of the game 
on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, 11 of 15 from the field, finished with 24 points in just 27 minutes. 
All 12 Bulls scored as they romped to their third victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte 118, Milwaukee 111 -- The Hornets never led during regulation at 
Charlotte, but behind J.R. Reid and Rex Chapman, went wild in overtime, scoring 
16 points. It was their first victory over the Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
Armon Gilliam, after missing four games because of tendinitis, scored 20 points 
and had 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks led most of the night and had a four-point lead with 35 seconds left 
in regulation. But Muggsy Bogues hit an 18-foot jumper and followed with two 
free throws. Ricky Pierce, who scored 28 points, gave the Bucks the lead back 
with a short jumper, but Chapman sent it into overtime with a jumper with four 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 116, Indiana 106 -- Charles Barkley had 33 points, 12 rebounds and 
five assists at Philadelphia to lead the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 103, Houston 92 -- Karl Malone scored 31 points at Salt Lake City and the 
Jazz held Akeem Olajuwon to 19 and won their fourth in a row. DAN HAFNER
