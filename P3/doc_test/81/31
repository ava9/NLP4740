  [Text] On 6 February, Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad 
Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabbur Al Thani concluded his visit to Cuba. 
According to his own statements prior to his departure from the 
Jose Marti International Airport, the 24 hours he spent in Cuba 
were very productive. The foreign minister met with Commander in 
Chief Fidel Castro, with whom he analyzed various issues of 
bilateral interest, and said that he was very impressed by the 
meeting and Fidel Castro's personality. In that respect, the 
visitor said that they arrived at an agreement on how to 
continue developing the relations between the two countries. It 
was agreed to take the relations between Cuba and Qatar to the 
ambassadorial level. 
  Regarding cooperation, the Qatari minister said that the 
results had been very positive. He announced that the two 
countries would exchange interests in the health care sector, 
especially in areas of medical and paramedical personnel, 
medicine, and vaccines. He also stated that his country has a 
special interest in the area of sports advisers. 
  Regarding the agreement signed by Foreign Ministers Roberto 
Robaina and Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabbur Al Thani, Cuba will open 
its embassy in Doha, the capital of Qatar, within the first six 
months of 1994; Qatar will do the same in Havana during the year. 
  At the ceremony, Robaina described the visit of his Qatari 
counterpart as a point of reference to increase ties of 
friendship between the two countries, which need to advance on 
the path of cooperation and exchange. The visitor also met with 
Jose Luis Rodriguez, minister president of the State Committee 
for Finance, and expressed interest in the conditions that exist 
in Cuba for the investment of foreign capital and the signing of 
mutually beneficial agreements. The foreign minister of Qatar 
stated that this was the first step for possible future 
agreements.
