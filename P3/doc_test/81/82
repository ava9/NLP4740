Radio News"] 
  [Text] Today, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina met 
with Defense Minister Prince Muhammad bin Khalifa Al Thani, to 
whom he delivered a message from Cuban President Fidel Castro. 
  According to Cuban delegation sources, Robaina and His 
Highness Al Thani spoke for more than 30 minutes in a positive 
atmosphere, consistent with the signs of hospitality and respect 
shown the delegation throughout its stay here. 
  The two officials exchanged views on the current status of 
bilateral relations and agreed that both governments have an 
interest in finding ways to increase and develop these 
relations. The Cuban official expressed his country's interest 
in developing cooperation in areas that have already been 
identified, including health, medical products, and tourism, as 
well as in other areas where equal opportunities and 
possibilities for investment exist. 
  Moreover, Prince Al Thani reasserted his country's 
determination to maintain independent relations with Cuba, based 
on respect for each country's sovereignty and the freedom to 
choose its own means of social development. Likewise, he said he 
is aware of the situation on the island, and pledged to sponsor 
the visit of a business delegation to Havana within the next few 
weeks. 
  The Cuban foreign minister also met today with Health 
Minister Sheik Hamad bin Sukhaym, who stated his willingness to 
hire Cuban health personnel and purchase biopharmaceutical 
industry products for their registration and use in Qatar. 
  A meeting was held with the minister of finance, economy, 
and 
trade at noon. Bilateral talks at the Foreign Ministry are 
scheduled to begin this afternoon, shortly before the departure 
to Havana.
