  [Text] Kuwait, 23 Feb (MENA)--The Kuwaiti Government has 
decided to recall its ambassador from Qatar for consultations. 
Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry officials declined to comment on this 
step. A responsible source told a MENA correspondent that this 
recall is routine and does not have other connotations. 
  However, observers in Kuwait say that the recall of the 
Kuwaiti ambassador comes in the wake of tense relations between 
the two countries after Qatari Television over the past few days 
screened video reports from inside Iraq on the negative effect 
of the economic blockade imposed on the Iraqi people. 
  Observers said Qatari Television on Friday carried an 
interview with Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf. 
Kuwaiti officials interpreted this action as being tantamount 
to Qatar's adoption of the Iraqi viewpoint. 
  The Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry on Sunday summoned Qatari 
Ambassador Ahmad Bin-Ghanim al-Rumayhi and conveyed to him 
unfriendly and unofficial criticism of the Qatari stand. The 
Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry also expressed apprehension about this 
rapprochement between Qatar and Iraq and asked him to explain 
the Qatari view on this subject. 
  Press reports today said that Kuwaiti Foreign Minister 
Shaykh 
Sabah al-Ahmad sent a strongly worded letter to Shaykh Fahim 
al-Qasimi, secretary general of the Gulf Cooperation Council on 
the recent rapprochement between Qatar and the Iraqi regime.
