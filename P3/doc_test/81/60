  [Text] Doha, 6 Jun (PL) -- At the end of a 40-hour official 
visit to this capital city today, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina said in a news conference: "I am not speaking of ideas 
only, but specific economic plans as well." 
  Robaina said that Qatar is a very special country because, 
despite the pressure applied on Cuba and countries that have 
relations with Cuba, Qatar decided to establish diplomatic 
relations with the island, relations that led to the 
establishment of a Cuban Embassy there. "It takes courage to do 
something like this, and Qatar is brave," Robaina said. 
  He reported that during his stay here negotiations were held 
on cooperation in the fields of health, sports, and biomedicine, 
and new methods were discussed to expand bilateral cooperation. 
  Official talks were held in the evening between the Cuban 
delegation and Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim 
Bin-Jabir Al Thani, during which the friendly ties between the 
two countries and willingness to strengthen these ties were 
affirmed. 
  In addition, on Monday Robaina inaugurated the Cuban Embassy 
in Doha, where diplomatic relations with neighboring Oman will 
also be handled.
