  [Excerpts] Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Talal 
Sat'an al-Hasan has emphasized that Jordan, under His Majesty 
King Husayn's leadership, highly evaluates the Jordanian-Qatari 
relations, and said this evaluation stems from both the heart 
and mind. 
  Answering a question posed by AL-DUSTUR on the official 
two-day visit to Jordan today by His Highness Shaykh Hamad 
bin-Jasim Al Thani, foreign minister of sisterly Qatar, al-Hasan 
said we view bilateral relations with respect and sincere desire 
to develop them. [passage omitted] 
  Al-Hasan said the State of Qatar has informed the Gulf 
Cooperation Council [GCC] states of the progress of 
Jordanian-Qatari relations, which have begun to positively and 
substantially improve, and that the GCC states highly valued 
this development. 
  The minister said the two countries agree that moves should 
be made to foster Arab cohesion, and that this can develop 
through bilateral or trilateral cooperation and through joint 
cooperation. He said this cooperation could be elevated to reach 
a comprehensive and full reconciliation. [passage omitted]
