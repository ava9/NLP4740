  [Text] Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad Bin-Jasin Bin-Jabbur 
Al Thani today is beginning a three-day visit to Cuba. He will 
meet with his Cuban counterpart, Roberto Robaina, and other 
Cuban leaders. 
  Qatar, a desert peninsula of 11,000 square km, borders on 
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Persian Gulf. 
Doha, the capital, groups almost half of the almost 400,000 
Qataris who live on the exports of petroleum and its byproducts. 
  Before the discovery of oil deposits in the 1940's, the 
basic 
activities were fishing and pearl cultivation. 
  Qatar was under the rule of the British and the Ottoman 
Empire until its independence in 1971. The following year, 
Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani assumed power. He nationalized the 
oil in 1977 and has kept the 1970 provisional constitution which 
does not allow political parties or elections. 
  Despite its different system, this Arab absolute monarchy 
has 
had good diplomatic relations with Cuba since their 
establishment in December 1989.
