  [Text] Tokyo, 2 Jun (XINHUA) -- During a meeting here 
today with Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation Wu Yi, Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said he 
hopes Japanese-Chinese friendly relations will always develop. 
  Hata said he was very glad to have met with President Jiang 
Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and other Chinese leaders when he, in 
the capacity of foreign minister, accompanied former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on a trip to China not long ago. He 
believes that visit to China was of great significance. 
  Hata said that a member of his cabinet had made an improper 
appraisal of history after he assumed the post of prime 
minister, and that he had taken action to deal with it. 
  Hata said: According to statistics compiled by Japan, the 
volume of trade between the two countries topped $38.6 billion 
last year. Japanese investment in China also grew rapidly last 
year. He was glad to see this and hopes for further development 
in Japanese-Chinese economic relations and trade. 
  Wu Yi said: Given a push by Sino-Japanese friendly relations 
and cooperation, bilateral cooperative relations in trade and 
economics have shown a favorable trend of development and 
entered a new stage. She stressed: Separated only by a trip 
over water, China and Japan enjoy the favorable conditions of 
climatic, geographical, and human closeness. Friendly relations 
and cooperation between China and Japan are important to Asia 
and the world. 
  During her visit to Japan, Wu Yi met with Japanese Foreign 
Affairs Minister Koji Kakizawa. She also held talks with 
Minister of International Trade and Industry Eijiro Hata to 
discuss the development of bilateral cooperative relations in 
trade and economics, bilateral textile trade, China's accession 
to GATT, and other issues. Eijiro Hata said Japan supports 
China's GATT entry. 
  Headed by Wu Yi, the delegation of the Chinese Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation arrived in Japan on 31 
May for a goodwill visit at the invitation of Japan's Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry.
