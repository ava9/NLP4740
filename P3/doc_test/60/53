  [Text] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
personally reprimanded Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano in a 
telephone call for calling the 1937 Nanjing massacre a 
fabrication, a high-ranking government source said Friday [6 
May]. 
  The source said Hata, currently on a four-nation European 
tour, was flabbergasted by Nagano's remarks on the Nanjing 
massacre in an interview which appeared in the MAINICHI 
SHIMBUN's Wednesday editions. The source said the premier was 
"very concerned" about the fallout from Nagano's statement and 
expressed understanding of China's prompt reaction to it. The 
source said Nagano, 71, will hold a news conference Friday 
afternoon to explain his remark and apologize.
