  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- China believes that 
China and Japan will continue to maintain their close 
coordination and cooperation and jointly promote their long-term 
and steady development of bilateral relations, after the 
establishment of the new Japanese cabinet, said Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin here today. 
  Wu made the remarks at a weekly press conference when asked 
to comment on the Tsutomu Hata cabinet which will be formed this 
afternoon. 
  Wu noted that Chinese Premier Li Peng had already sent a 
telegram of congratulations to Hata. "Tsutomu Hata is a 
statesman well-known by the Chinese people," said Wu. "We 
appreciate his zeal and foresight in the effort to enhance the 
friendship and cooperation between Japan and China, as well as 
all the useful work he has done to this end," he added. 
  As for the new cabinet of Japan, Wu said: "I would like to 
point out that various political parties, whether in or out of 
the government, share the common view of developing mutually 
beneficial and cooperative relations between China and Japan in 
all fields."
