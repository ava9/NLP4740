  [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- When answering a 
reporter's questions today, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Wu Jianmin said: The attitude expressed by Japanese Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata in his oral message to Premier Li Peng on 
his determination to prevent past unfortunate history from being 
repeated is "sensible." 
  At today's news conference, a reporter asked: Has the 
Chinese side received Prime Minister Hata's letter to Chinese 
leaders? Does the Chinese side have any comments on Prime 
Minister Hata's letter and on his inaugural address? 
  Wu Jianmin said: Japanese Ambassador to China Kunihiro 
Michihiko conveyed to Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan 
on 10 May an oral message from Prime Minister Hata to Premier Li 
Peng on the remarks made by former Japanese Justice Minister 
Shigeto Nagano in which Nagano distorted the history of Japanese 
aggression against China. We have noticed Prime Minister Hata's 
profound introspection concerning Japan's past aggression and 
colonial rule that inflicted unbearable suffering on many 
peoples. He indicated that past history shall be treated 
correctly and that the young generation shall be educated with 
the correct historical views. He is also determined to prevent 
the past unfortunate history from being repeated. 
  Wu Jianmin said: "We believe Prime Minister Hata's attitude 
is sensible and is in accordance with the trend of history, and 
we appreciate his attitude."
