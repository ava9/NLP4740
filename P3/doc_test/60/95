  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Japan's ruling coalition 
today picked Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata to succeed Morihiro 
Hosokawa as prime minister. 
  The decision was made at a meeting here this afternoon of 
the 
coalition parties which agreed to present the 58-year-old Hata 
as their joint candidate in a parliamentary vote next Monday. 
  Observers here believe that the veteran Hata is certain to 
win because of the coalition's majority in the decisive lower 
house.
