  [Text] Seoul, May 7 KYODO -- Japan's ambassador to South 
Korea met with Korea's foreign minister Saturday [7 May] to try 
to defuse some of the outrage over remarks by Japanese Justice 
Minister Shigeto Nagano about Japan's role during World War II. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu in a meeting with Japanese 
Ambassador to South Korea Toshio Goto, conveyed to the Japanese 
Government the concerns and regrets that Seoul has over Nagano's 
remarks, Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said. Goto told 
Han that the official position of the Japanese Government will 
be taken after Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata returns home Saturday 
evening from an overseas trip. The ambassador also said that he 
received an instruction from the Japanese Government to convey 
to Seoul that Japan takes the official stance that South Korea 
and Japan must build future-oriented relations while looking 
squarely at the past. 
  Han, in responding to the ambassador's remarks, said that 
Japan should take proper action to prevent any recurrence of the 
matter and heal the wounds of the past, adding, "South Koreans 
got hurt seriously and expressed indignation over the remarks." 
On Friday, Han summoned the ambassador to the Foreign Ministry 
and expressed "shock" and deep regrets over Nagano's remarks, 
demanding that Japan clarify the remarks and present a clear 
position. 
  In Tokyo, the Japanese justice minister offered Saturday to 
resign after setting off a flurry of international condemnation 
with his remarks that Japan was not an aggressor during World 
War II and the 1937 Nanjing Massacre was a fabrication. 
  Following the invasion of the then Chinese capital of 
Nanjing 
in December 1937, Imperial Japanese Army troops slaughtered more 
than 300,000 Chinese civilians, according to Chinese estimates. 
Japanese historians, however, tend to cite lower estimates. 
According to estimates given at the war crimes tribunal in 
Tokyo, about 42,000 civilians were killed in Nanjing and more 
than 100,000 civilians and prisoners of war were killed in the 
vicinity over the following six weeks. 
  Also on Friday, South Korea lodged a strong protest with 
Japan over Nagano's separate remark terming "comfort women" as 
licensed prostitutes. Yu Byung-woo, director general of the 
Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs Bureau, summoned Japanese 
Embassy official Hiroshi Shigeta on Friday and expressed deep 
regrets over Nagano's remarks on the "comfort women," whom the 
Japanese military took to front line brothels during World War 
II, spokesman Chang said. 
  Nagano made the remarks in an interview with KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE on Tuesday. Historians estimate that as many as 200,000 
women, most of them from the Korean Peninsula, were taken to 
wartime brothels to provide sex as "comfort women," as they were 
euphemistically called, for Japanese soldiers.
