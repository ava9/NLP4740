  [Text] Damascus, May 7 KYODO -- Japan will convey to China 
and South Korea soon what Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is 
thinking about Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's remark on 
Japan's World War II campaign, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa 
said Friday [6 May]. Kakizawa told Japanese reporters traveling 
with him that he has instructed Japan's embassies in Beijing and 
Seoul to inform the countries of Hata's thinking. Kakizawa said 
that the justice minister has taken back his remark that the 
1937 Nanjing Massacre was a fabrication and that he thinks it 
wrong to define the war as a war of aggression by Japan. 
  Asked whether Nagano should leave the post of justice 
minister, Kakizawa said it is up to the prime minister to 
decide. Kakizawa also said he will convey his own idea to Hata 
after returning home Sunday. 
  Hata, at a news conference in Brussels on Friday, said he 
regrets Nagano's remarks but skirted the issue of whether he 
will seek Nagano's resignation. Hata said that he has 
reprimanded Nagano over the telephone for his remarks, which he 
characterized as "not appropriate." Hata, however, said, "I 
don't want to talk about (Nagano's) resignation at this stage." 
  In an interview with the mass-circulation daily MAINICHI 
SHIMBUN published Wednesday, Nagano, a former chief of staff of 
the Ground Self-Defense Force, said "the Nanjing incident was a 
fabrication," and "I still think it wrong to define the war as a 
war of aggression (by Japan)." He called a news conference 
Friday and retracted the remarks. 
  Following the invasion of the then Chinese capital of 
Nanjing 
in December 1937, Imperial Japanese Army troops slaughtered more 
than 300,000 Chinese civilians, according to Chinese estimates. 
Japanese historians, however, tend to cite lower estimates. 
According to estimates given at the war crimes tribunal in 
Tokyo, about 42,000 civilians were killed in Nanjing and more 
than 100,000 civilians and prisoners of war were killed in the 
vicinity over the next six weeks.
