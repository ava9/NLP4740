  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Komeito leader Koshiro 
Ishida, serving as director general of the Management and 
Coordination Agency, said Monday [9 May] it was "only natural" 
for Shigeto Nagano to have resigned as justice minister over his 
remarks on Japan's wartime aggression. 
  Ishida said in a press conference that Nagano's "extremely 
regrettable" remarks that the 1937 Nanjing massacre never 
happened and that Japan was not an aggressor in World War II 
"greatly impacted China and other Asian countries." 
  "So it's only natural that he took responsibility for it," 
he 
said. 
  Nagano, a 71-year-old member of the coalition's core party 
Shinseito and former military serviceman, resigned on Saturday 
after holding the post of justice minister for only 10 days. He 
was replaced by Hiroshi Nakai of the Democratic Socialist Party. 
  Ishida suggested that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata undertake 
some kind of political overture vis-a-vis China in order to put 
bilateral relations back on a firm footing. He refuted 
criticism that the Nagano incident reflects the allegedly 
hawkish nature of the Hata cabinet and said that Nagano's remark 
was a personal observation. 
  In a separate press conference, Defense Agency Director 
General Atsushi Kanda said Nagano's remarks were 
"inappropriate," particularly so in light of the fact that it 
has recently become the government's clearly established view 
that Japan waged a war of aggression during World War II.
