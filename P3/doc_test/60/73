  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- A senior official of 
President Yeltsin's administration has stressed the important 
role of ex-prime minister of Japan Morihiro Hokosawa in the 
development of relations between the two countries. He 
expressed hope that the new Japanese government, headed by 
Tsutomu Hata who was elected prime minister today, would pursue 
the same policy in this sphere. 
  "I think Hosokawa has done very much for the development of 
Russian-Japanese relations," head of a department of the press 
service of the Russian president and specialist in Japanese 
studies Aleksandr Orfenov told ITAR-TASS today. In his opinion, 
Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo last October is proof to it. Important 
documents were signed during the visit. 
  "We hope Hata will continue the political course of the 
previous cabinet, aimed at developing relations with the Russian 
Federation," the spokesman for the president's press service 
said. In his opinion, Hata's statements during his visit to 
Moscow last March give grounds for such hope. Judging by those 
statements, he is a sober-minded politician. 
  According to Orfenov, it is regrettable that during Tsutomu 
Hata's recent visit to Moscow President Yeltsin was on leave in 
Sochi and could not meet him. At that time Tsutomu Hata was 
deputy prime minister and head of the Japanese Foreign Ministry. 
"I think it would be useful for them both to meet and establish 
personal contacts," he said.
