  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Strengthening of economic 
relations between China and Japan is good not only for the two 
countries but also for the Asia-Pacific region and the whole 
world, China's trade minister said here Thursday [2 Jun]. 
  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi made 
the remark in her meeting with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata in 
the Diet building, a Foreign Ministry official said. 
  Wu, who previously met Hata in Seattle last November, also 
expressed hope for early implementation of Japan's planned 
fourth package of yen loans to China through official 
development assistance, the official said. 
  Hata replied that Japan should try to forge future-oriented 
relations with China based on repentance over controversial 
remarks by former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano, the official 
said. 
  Nagano resigned in early May over his remarks that the 1937 
Nanjing Massacre never happened and that Japan was not an 
aggressor in World War II.
