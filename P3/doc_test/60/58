  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Emperor Akihito appointed 
Tsutomu Hata prime minister of Japan in a Thursday [28 April] 
morning ceremony at the imperial palace, government officials 
said. The appointment formally made Hata prime minister of 
Japan. 
  Hata was named prime minister in elections in both houses of 
the Diet on Monday. 
  His appointment as prime minister was delayed, however, by 
political unrest sparked by the establishment of a large 
parliamentary coalition grouping that excluded the Social 
Democratic Party, which had been the biggest single party in the 
coalition. The SDP declared early Tuesday it had left the 
coalition. 
  Hata, head of the coalition's core party, Shinseito, will 
form his cabinet later Thursday, the officials said.
