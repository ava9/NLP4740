  [Text] Beijing, May 15 KYODO -- A delegation of the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ], Japan's second largest 
opposition grouping, arrived in Beijing on Sunday [15 May] and 
conveyed a conciliatory message to China from Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata. 
  The eight-member delegation headed by SDP General Secretary 
Wataru Kubo met with Ding Guangen, chief of the Chinese 
Communist Party's Propaganda Department, and expressed Hata's 
assurances that Japan will remain mindful of its past aggression 
in Asia, delegation sources said. 
  The message follows Hata's letter last week to Chinese 
Premier Li Peng, in which he tried to repair damage done earlier 
this month when then Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano denied 
Japan's aggression during World War II and asserted that the 
1937 Nanjing massacre was a fabrication. Nagano has since 
resigned. 
  Hata restated in a policy speech on May 10 that Japan 
recognizes its "past actions, including aggression and colonial 
rule, had caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for many 
people." 
  Ding was quoted as telling the delegation that "a correct 
understanding of history is the basis of friendly China-Japan 
relations." 
  He added it is undeniable that the two nations have deviated 
from that aim during the 22 years of re-established diplomatic 
ties. 
  The SDP delegation, which will meet on Tuesday with General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin, is on an eight-day visit to mark the 10th 
anniversary of exchanges with the Chinese Communist Party. The 
mission will return on May 22 after visiting Dalian and 
Changchun.
