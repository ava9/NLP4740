The Coast Guard will test a new system for tracking oil tankers in Alaska's 
Prince William Sound, site of the nation's worst oil spill. It will utilize 
satellite signals and long-range aids to navigation rather than radar, a Coast 
Guard spokesman said. A satellite is a good tool for tracking "because it is 
not affected by mountains, which is a problem in Alaska," the spokesman said. 
He added that the reliability of radar was limited by weather. Tanker traffic 
in Prince William Sound has been monitored by radar. But, when the Exxon Valdez 
ran aground last March 24, it was beyond the area normally scanned by radar, 
the Coast Guard said. The new system will be evaluated for a year in the sound 
and 22 other ports and waterways around the country. Vessel owners will be 
responsible for the cost of installing the "black boxes" that link up with the 
system, a Coast Guard spokesman said.
