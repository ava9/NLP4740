THE OIL CONNECTIONS

</HEADLINE>

As Ronald Reagan used to say about recalcitrant members of Congress, "If they 
don't see the light, make them feel the heat." Well, the Exxon Valdez accident 
has put considerable heat on the Bush Administration and its avid support for 
oil development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. Secretary of 
the Interior Manuel Lujan Jr., acknowledging the mood of Congress, said there 
is no chance of Congress passing a bill this year to open up the refuge to the 
oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is time for the Administration to see the light and also declare that 
there will be no oil drilling off the coast of Northern California at least for 
the duration of George Bush's tenure in office. The Administration also should 
delay other proposed oil lease sales along the California coast until the 
federal government has conducted a thorough review and revision of regulations 
governing oil- spill containment and cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The oil industry and top Bush Administration officials have insisted that there 
was no connection between the Exxon Valdez crude-oil spill and proposed 
drilling in the wildlife preserve about 100 miles east of Prudhoe Bay, the 
giant oil development on the Alaskan coast of the Arctic Ocean. But any oil 
found in the wildlife refuge can get to market by only one route -- via a new 
pipeline over to Prudhoe Bay, down through the trans-Alaska pipeline to the 
port of Valdez and then by tanker through Prince William Sound to refineries on 
the West Coast. That seems a tight enough connection. 
</P>
<P>
Even the oil industry's most influential allies in Congress have given up hope 
of legislation this year to explore in the refuge. Sen. J. Bennett Johnston 
(D-La.), chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and 
sponsor of a refuge drilling bill, commented: "It is not only politically 
foolish to push legislation now, it's foolish from a policy point of view." 
</P>
<P>
On the House side, Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) returned from three days in 
Alaska to declare that the accident was "the tragic result of a systematic 
assault by the oil industry that rendered ineffective the entire system of 
regulatory safeguards." Miller, whose subcommittee oversees the Arctic refuge, 
said there must be a strong authority established to exercise control over 
accident cleanups. Indeed there must be. 
</P>
<P>
As with the refuge, the Bush Administration might not see any relationship 
between the Exxon Valdez and drilling off the Northern California coast. But 
the connection is very real, linked by the federal government's eagerness to 
accommodate the oil companies. Rep. Mel Levine (D-Los Angeles) and other 
California officials have disclosed warnings from federal experts about the 
potential dangers of drilling off the spectacular Northern California coast. 
The warnings had been either altered or suppressed altogether within the 
Department of the Interior. 
</P>
<P>
In one memo, officials of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said that the 
Interior Department's oil leasing agency had "inaccurately painted a picture of 
a routine operation with few potential impacts when in fact offshore 
development in Northern California and the proposed tanker traffic is a 
high-risk operation in rough seas, in a geologically unstable area, with 
potentially devastating impacts on coastal resources." That comment had been 
deleted from the version of the memo made public. Also censored was the 
statement that current technology was not capable of cleaning up a spill in the 
North Coast area. 
</P>
<P>
It's time to see the light: Drilling, pumping or transporting oil in a 
wilderness environment must never again be considered routine.
