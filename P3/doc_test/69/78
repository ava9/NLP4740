Exxon Corp. must restore the soiled Alaska environment after it finishes 
cleaning up the nation's worst oil spill, Secretary of Interior Manuel Lujan 
Jr. said Wednesday after he spent two days touring areas affected by the Exxon 
Valdez spill. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to calling on Exxon to restore the grease-coated shores to 
pre-spill conditions, Lujan said the time has come to resume offshore drilling, 
which was suspended after the tanker struck a reef and lost 11 million gallons 
of oil in Alaska's Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan said that the freeze on drilling off California, Florida and Alaska 
should be ended. He also predicted approval of controversial drilling plans for 
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northeast Alaska and a federal auction 
of tracts there in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan reiterated the need for further environmental efforts by Exxon, but his 
overall message was that the Bush Administration wanted to get back into the 
federal oil tract leasing business. 
</P>
<P>
Federal offshore oil and gas leasing was put on hold in various places, and 
Congress even placed a moratorium on drilling in Alaska's Bristol Bay, a rich 
fishing ground where leases had been sold before the Exxon Valdez spill. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for all kinds of ways to open it up," Lujan said of the offshore 
areas picked for drilling. "We're very dedicated to move ahead with it again in 
an environmentally sensitive manner." 
</P>
<P>
Money might turn the heads of drilling opponents in coastal states, Lujan said. 
"One of the things we're looking at is to share oil revenues with the local 
communities, so the local community doesn't just have the impact and no money 
to take care of it. So that might reduce some of the opposition." 
</P>
<P>
Lujan said he had neither the authority nor the desire to cancel the Bristol 
Bay lease sale -- which three Alaska governors tried unsuccessfully to stop 
before the Exxon spill. He said: "If I do it for Alaska, then Florida will be 
asking us to do the same thing, and I'll never be able to lease another inch of 
ground anywhere, because every state will come in and say, 'Cancel that lease.'
