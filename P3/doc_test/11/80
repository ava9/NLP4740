Mystic Pizza (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.), one of the few genuine hits to emerge last 
year from independent American film making, takes a fairly old idea -- three 
bachelor girls on the loose -- and gives it a patina of freshness by using New 
England coastal city backdrops and casting a delightful archetypal trio: Julia 
Roberts (the reckless beauty), Lili Taylor (the vivacious kook) and Annabeth 
Gish (sensitive and brainy). "Mystic Pizza" refers to the seaside pizzeria 
where they all work; the director, Daniel Petrie Jr., piles on the toppings and 
makes it tasty.

Also on Sunday, The Hot Rock (Channel 5 at 8 p.m.) is a caper movie with a 
bungling gang led by Robert Redford and George Segal on an inept diamond heist. 
Based on a Donald Westlake novel, adapted by William Goldman and directed by 
Peter Yates, it suggests that someone was thinking of the 1958 Italian caper 
classic, "Big Deal on Madonna Street" -- though they weren't thinking hard 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
Invitation to Hell (Channel 9 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is another variation on Faust. 
Made for TV, it was directed by Wes Craven in 1984: the same year he made 
horror history with the first "Nightmare on Elm Street." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Cimino's Year of the Dragon (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a 
controversial revenge thriller about an obsessive cop (Mickey Rourke) battling 
a suave Chinatown drug king (John Lone) through streets running with blood, sex 
and exoticism. Like all of Cimino's work, it's excessive, somewhat delirious 
and visually overwhelming -- and, since Oliver Stone co-wrote the script, the 
dialogue bristles with profanity and wild verbal energy. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Ruben's The Stepfather (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m., repeated Saturday 
at 8 p.m.), also written by Donald Westlake, has a simple premise: a teen-age 
daughter suspects her bland stepfather of secretly being a maniac -- and she's 
right (as we know from the first scene). What makes "Stepfather" special is 
Westlake's clever construction, Ruben's camera pyrotechnics and a mesmerizing 
performance by Terry O'Quinn as the mild-mannered maniac: a psychotic who wants 
to create a Norman Rockwell world and can't understand why people keep messing 
it up.

In Woody Allen's recent stretch of superb comedies, the 1988 Radio Days 
(Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is sometimes slighted. Yet it's as great as 
anything he's done recently: a reminiscence of his Brooklyn boyhood, told 
through the double-frame of his family's charming foibles and the radio shows 
they all loved (symbol of distant, glamorous Manhattan). It's as 
autobiographical as "Annie Hall," as sweet and fantastic as "The Purple Rose of 
Cairo." 
</P>

On Thursday, there's good news and bad news for John Wayne fans. The good news 
is that Sands of Iwo Jima, the 1949 Allan Dwan movie which ranks as one of the 
Duke's paradigmatic war epics, is playing (Channel 11 at 8 p.m.). The bad news 
is that it's apparently been colorized. Wait till next time, pilgrims. 
Meanwhile, The Seduction (Channel 5 at 8 p.m.) has Morgan Fairchild as a TV 
newswoman terrorized by a crazed fan: a movie that probably should be 
de-colorized, and maybe even de-filmed. The pick of the evening is probably 
Frank Perry's macabre piece of Hollywood camp, Mommie Dearest (Channel 13 at 8 
p.m.), with Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford -- in a story based on Christina 
Crawford's memoirs -- delivering the kind of no-brakes performance that can 
knock you out and haunt your dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Penn's Dead of Winter (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.) seems better in 
retrospect. It's a cliched melodrama, with Mary Steenburgen as a bewildered 
actress in a snowbound house, persecuted by crazy people -- but once you 
realize the story is worthless and derivative and going nowhere, you can 
appreciate the grace-notes by the brilliant Penn and by Steenburgen, one of our 
most radiant actresses. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, there's the usual smorgasbord. Under Fire (Channel 9 at 8 p.m.) is 
a good, rock 'em, shock 'em political thriller, done in the best imitation 
Costa-Gavras style by director Roger Spottiswoode, co-writer Ron Shelton ("Bull 
Durham") and actors Nick Nolte and Gene Hackman, as American newsmen caught in 
the caldron of the Nicaraguan revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday: Avenging Angel (Channel 9 at 11 p.m.) is appalling trash 
about an underage hooker who redeems herself by becoming a vigilante. Mary My 
Dearest (Channel 28 at 10 p.m.), a rare 1982 Mexican film, boasts a screenplay 
by no less than Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez; it's directed by Jaime 
Humberto Hermosillo. And Kung Fu: The Movie (Channel 13 at 8 p.m.) recalls more 
weird executive casting choices -- when Bruce Lee was turned down for the 
original martial arts TV series. Here, the producers make amends by casting son 
Brandon Lee as a Manchu assassin on David (Caine) Carradine's trail.
