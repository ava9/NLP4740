STOP] OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT (PG)
Empire
Orson Welles, summoned to Hollywood to make Citizen Kane, called cinema and
its paraphernalia the 'greatest train set a boy ever had.' Cue the greatest
love affair the cinema ever had.
Before and after Welles's dictum, the 'rolling stock' of film through a
camera or projector found a poetic rhyme in the rolling stock of trains
trundling through exotic landscapes. There is a rhyme too in the very
experience of filmgoing. Out there through the train window (the movie
screen) unfolds the changing world. In here in the well-upholstered carriage
(the auditorium), we the audience sit serene, attentive and invulnerable.
Lars Von Trier's Europa, a train movie that would have thrilled Welles, is a
mad, mad, mad, mad box of tricks. Into Germany at the end of World War 2
comes a gauche bespectacled young American (Jean-Marc Barr) hoping do his
bit for the Marshall Plan. With his railway superintendent uncle's
encouragement he will become a train guard and help to re-knit the damaged
arteries of a defeated land.
But he reckons without the 'Werewolves': Nazi-sympathising terrorists who
plant bombs and recruit pretty women like Barr's new girlfriend Barbara
Sukowa. And he reckons without the sinister liaisons between guilty ex-Nazis
like Sukowa's railway tycoon father and carpetbagging American officers like
General Eddie Constantine. This veteran Franco-Yank actor, who looks more
weirdly majestic with each movie, now resembles a bullfrog seen through a
magnifying glass.
The third thing the hero and we reckon without is the blizzard of visual and
dramatic effects director Von Trier hurls at us. The movie is in
black-and-white and colour, often at the same time. The camera passes
through walls, descends through solid floors or moves from a house into a
train with no visible 'cuts'. Multiple back-projection creates a 3D-like
'layering' of scenes. And the film abounds in gloriously clever ellipses
like the shot in which Barr and Sukowa, romancing on a midnight bridge, turn
to the sky and water behind them, which then 'dissolve' into the giant face
of the priest officiating at their marriage.
Is it all just fun and flamboyance? The Dane Von Trier, who won a Jury Prize
last year at Cannes and whose first film The Element Of Crime was a
delicious Borgesian bagatelle, has enough fresh stylistic ideas to keep
European cinema going until the next ice age. But Europa is also a cunningly
crafted parable about Europe Now disguised as Europe Then. The broken
boundaries and human flux in 1945 are much the same as those in 1992; only
the historical crisis has changed.
As Babel-like tongues battle to be heard on the building site of a new
continent, Europa's gaggle of French, German and American actors for once
vindicates Euro-pudding casting. Cultural confusion is the point in this
film. And the gathering of the plot-threads into a trainbound climax, as
clocks and bombs tick towards Judgment Day, makes not just for a satisfying
thriller but also for an emblematic image of historical countdown.
Trundling on rails of genius through stations of moviegoing bliss, Europa is
in all senses - all good senses - the sleeper of the year.
* * * The Euro-pudding problems solved by Europa are more obdurate in
Voyager. German director Volker Schlondorff, adapting Max Frisch's novel
Homo Faber, appoints an American hero (Sam Shepard) and looses him across
the globe with a mid-life crisis, a French girlfriend (Julie Delpy) and
memories of a German-Jewish old flame (Barbara Sukowa) now living in Greece.
Before the pudding is fully set alight, a flags-of-all-nations supporting
cast is stuck into it. As a result, the deliriously itinerant story - which
includes an ocean voyage, a trans-Europe car journey and a plane crash -
finds a storm of subtitles or foreign accents in every port.
But then what would you expect from a director whose agent must have a
sideline as a travel agent? Since winning native German acclaim for The Tin
Drum, Schlondorff's films have been made in Beirut (Circle Of Deceit), Paris
(Swann In Love) and New York (Death Of A Salesman). Somehow Voyager still
has an intermittent wit and power. Perhaps it is the ironic awareness of
rootlessness in the title and the sly jokes about a planet colonised by the
transport industry. (The air stewardesses still announce 'Tonight's meal is.
. .' when their passengers are squatting in the desert around a shattered
fuselage.) Or perhaps it is Mr Shepard, harmonising diverse locales with the
laconic, iconic grandeur he brought to The Right Stuff.
Indeed if you can take the warring-tongues dramatis personae and the dotty
ending - snake bites and dynastic revelations worthy of Aeschylus - Voyager
is oddly likable. In Columbus year it reminds us that when man discovered
the world was round, he also discovered that human problems are shared and
circular in whatever place and with whatever accent they are found.
Final Analysis, starring Richard Gere and Kim Basinger, is a mystery
thriller. The thriller part is about a psychoanalyst who falls for a
beautiful murdereress. The mystery is why it ambles on for two hours without
once raising the hairs on our spines.
We are in a moody, glossy San Francisco designed by Dean Tavoularis of The
Godfather and photographed by Jorden Cronenweth of Blade Runner. Every plot
device you can think of is lobbed at us by director Phil Joanou (State Of
Grace) and writer Wesley Strick (Cape Fear): courtroom scenes, two sexy
sisters sobbing on the shrink's shoulders (Basinger's sibling is Uma
Thurman) and a climax atop a sinister lighthouse stylishly mocked up by Mr
Tavoularis near the Golden Gate Bridge.
Yet almost none of the film works. Partly because Basinger's femme fatale is
about as interesting as a stocking advertisement come to life. Mainly
because there are so many tic-like nods to other movies - Saboteur, Vertigo,
Jagged Edge - that the film resembles an overanxious chicken browsing around
the filmic farmyard shortly before being taken off to get the chop.
Speaking of which, was it not Charles I who walked and talked two hours
after he was beheaded? This is not a historical fact, I know, but a
schoolboy solecism. But I recalled it during Percy Adlon's Salmonberries: a
strange Sapphic romance between a chattery dyed-blonde German emigrant
(Rosel Zech) and a taciturn androgynous Eskimo (kd lang). It takes place in
Alaska, with a short trip to Zech's Berlin, where she re-traces her
husband's death in a wartime shooting.
The tableau-vivant style of Adlon's Sugarbabies and Bagdad Cafe is here
married to a travelogue lyricism. The Alaskan snowscapes are gorgeous:
wall-to-wall Melvillean whiteness tinged with sunset pinks and scored for
distant wolf howls. And Miss lang, a Canadian singer-songwriter in love with
lower-case lettering, is an iconic contrast to Zech's peroxide excitability.
But eventually we ask, Where is it all going? And the answer returns,
Nowhere. It walks and talks. It even enjoys the scenery. Yet two hours later
it is as inert and silenced as the late King Charles.
Stop] Or My Mom Will Shoot, a 'comedy' directed by Roger Spottiswoode of
Turner And Hooch, is a piece of germ warfare from Hollywood designed to
empty or quarantine British cinemas over Easter. Sylvester Stallone is the
LA cop who needs a new partner, Estelle (Golden Girls) Getty as his Mom
accidentally becomes that new partner. Ho ho. Lots of chases, pratfalls and
senior citizen gags. I laughed once, when I remembered a good joke from
another, similar and better film.
