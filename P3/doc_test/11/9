Kaizo Hayashi's "To Sleep So As to Dream," which screens Sunday at 7 p.m. at 
LACMA as part of Japan Week L.A., is pure enchantment, a tribute to the beauty 
and power of the silent cinema that is as knowing as it is affectionate. Except 
for sound effects, snatches of music and some ominous tape-recorded messages it 
is silent itself.

An elderly lady, Madame Cherry Blossom (Fujiko Fukamizu), whom we learn was a 
silent actress, is watching in her home a 50-year-old serial -- in which she 
was the heroine -- called Princess Bellflower. Just as the masked samurai hero 
is to reveal his identity the film breaks. Her butler (Yoshio Yoshida) -- and 
onetime director -- hires a pair of naive young detectives (Shiro Sano, Koji 
Otake), saying that Bellflower has been kidnaped by M. Pathe &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Their investigation takes them to such quaint locales as the General Jintan 
Tower, the Flower Star Wheel and eventually the Electric House, an Asakusa 
movie theater, where Pathe just happens to be presenting Madame Cherry 
Blossom's serial, "The Eternal Mystery." "To Sleep So As to Dream" is set in 
the late '50s -- when, incidentally, Hayashi, was born; how the Electric Dream 
happens to be still operating can be chalked up to the movie magic that blurs 
fantasy and reality and which its writer-director celebrates with such 
imagination and precision. 
</P>
<P>
 Madame Cherry Blossom proves to be a benign Norma Desmond whose own devoted 
Max Von Mayerling wants to help recapture her youth in the most innocent and 
loving way possible. "To Sleep" is at its most touching when expressing the 
silent cinema's unique potential for pathos. On another level, Hayashi is 
having some gentle fun with early detective serials of the kind pioneered and 
epitomized by Louis Feuillade's fantastic "Fantomas" and "Judex." 
</P>
<P>
As for why Hayashi, who will introduce "To Sleep So As to Dream" (Times-rated 
Family), chose to make his 1986 feature debut with such a film, he has said 
that "This is the origin of the motion picture; there is a sobriety (to 
black-and-white silent cinema) which refuses anything which is not enjoyable." 
</P>
<P>
Also screening (at 7:30 p.m. at the Pacific Design Center Theater) as part of 
Japan Week L.A. are "The Discarnates" (Monday) and "Buddies" (Tuesday). 
Nobuhiko Obayashi's "The Discarnates" connects with our deepest longings in a 
remarkably potent fashion. Who, after all, has not yearned for reunion with 
long-gone loved ones? Not only does Obayashi and his writers make such an 
encounter convincing but also give it a larger purpose; the result is a 
graceful, heart-tugging fantasy of the supernatural. The film's hero (Morio 
Kazama) is a dapper, 40-year-old writer of TV soap operas; like the detectives 
in "To Sleep" he too encounters the past in an old Asakusa theater. 
</P>
<P>
Shown recently at the Little Tokyo Cinemas, Yasuo Furuhata's "Buddies" exudes 
such a warm, sentimental glow that it's easy to overlook its subtlety and 
complexity, both as a consideration of the sometimes thorny nature of 
friendship, and beyond this, the treacherousness of nostalgia. The time is the 
spring of 1937, just before the Rape of Nanking, a prelude to wartime madness. 
Ken Takakura is wonderful as an industrialist who has an unrequited love for 
the beautiful wife (Sumiko Fuji) of an oafish office worker, his army buddy.
