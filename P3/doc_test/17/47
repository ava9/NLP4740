<P>
Shirley Ceasar is 27, and she is expecting her 10th child. But another baby 
won't be a burden for her. Like the rest of her kids, the child will be taken 
care of by its grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley, a crack addict for at least four years, lives in Harlem with her 
boyfriend, the father of all her children. Her mother, Sarah Mae Ceasar, lives 
a 15-minute subway ride away, in a housing project in lower Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
There, in a cramped three-bedroom apartment, Sarah Ceasar takes care of five of 
her grandchildren, including 11-year-old Walique, who was born deaf and 
mentally retarded. Shirley's other children are cared for by their paternal 
grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to go up and see them and there was nothing in the refrigerator to eat, 
no clothes for them to wear, they weren't even going to school," said Sarah 
Ceasar, 57, who is hoping to adopt the children. "I'd bring them clothes. Their 
father would sell the clothes for drugs." 
</P>
<P>
In New York City and other large metropolitan areas, grandmothers such as 
Ceasar are the glue holding together many poor black families splintered by 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, the crack epidemic has made addicts of more young 
minority women than any other drug in history. In particular, experts say, it 
has threatened the tradition of black women who often hold their families 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a quality in crack that is so quickly addictive that people don't get 
away with experimenting with it," said Richard Johnson, director of the Jewish 
Child Care Assn. of New York. "Women who would normally retain some 
responsibility and some conscience about their children don't have the chance. 
They're addicted so quickly. They're just lost." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, the number of children in New York City's kinship foster care 
program, which allows grandmothers and other relatives to receive aid for 
taking care of dependents, has jumped from 150 to 17,000. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of the placements of children within kinship foster care are 
the result of mothers' crack addiction, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the absence of a father is bad, but now the mother is missing," said 
Melba Hamilton, director of the Harlem Dowling Children's Service. "These 
children are facing a very bleak future." 
</P>
<P>
And, as a result, grandmothers like Sarah Ceasar have been called upon to 
assume enormous family burdens. 
</P>
<P>
They are mostly Southern women, tied to a rural past while mired in the harsh 
economic realities of the inner city, according to social workers. Many came to 
New York as newlyweds, hoping for a better life. Most have outlived their 
husbands and lost some of their children to drugs and the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Now they must become mothers again, sometimes caring for children born impaired 
or mentally handicapped because of their mothers' addictions. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the grandmothers are really exhausted and would like to not have to 
do this," said Johnson. "But if it has to be done, they're going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Some grandmothers care for their grandchildren on an informal basis. But a 
growing number are taking advantage of kinship foster care and the financial 
aid it offers. Depending on the age of the child, foster grandmothers are 
allowed anywhere from $450 to $900 per month for their care. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the strain the grandchildren add to their lives, some grandmothers are 
surprisingly resilient and learn to enjoy having kids around again. 
</P>
<P>
Some are younger than the stereotypical grandmother. In the words of Lorraine 
Hale, director of Hale House, a Harlem home for the children of unwed, working 
and drug-addicted mothers, "They don't all wear their gray hair in a bun and 
act wise." But they're often realistic when it comes to the problems of their 
own children. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not my fault," Sarah Ceasar said of the drug addiction of her daughter, 
Shirley, and her other children. "It's their fault and it's their life. If they 
don't want to make anything out of their life, there's nothing I can do about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Her grandchildren remain loyal to their parents but said they love their 
grandmother and the security of her home. 
</P>
<P>
"She takes us out places and does a lot of things with us," said Rasheeda, 10. 
"I like being home with her instead of a foster home." 
</P>
<P>
The children's father, Lorenzo Adderley, 28, also said he was grateful to Sarah 
Ceasar. As he stood in the doorway of the Harlem apartment he shares with 
Shirley Ceasar, whom he met when he was 14, Adderley said that he was looking 
for work and that Shirley soon may go into a drug rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Ceasar said both Adderley and her daughter are addicts. Adderley said 
Shirley was, but denied that he was an addict, though he appeared to be under 
the influence of drugs during an interview. Shirley Ceasar declined to be 
interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Ceasar, who was born and reared in Sumter, S.C., is not unlike many of 
the grandmothers who look a decade or more older than their age, testament to 
unusually harsh lives. 
</P>
<P>
Her life story, the details of which she recounted stoically in her living room 
as her grandchildren did their homework at the dining room table, has been one 
of frequent tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Her father was an alcoholic who beat his wife and children and forced her to 
begin work in the field picking peas and corn at the age of 8. Two of her 
brothers were murdered as young adults. She got pregnant at 13 and married the 
father. 
</P>
<P>
After the family moved to New York, one of her sons was strangled at age 17 and 
another died of a heart attack in her living room at age 30. 
</P>
<P>
Seated in a Manhattan social services office with her caseworker, Blanche 
Giles, 68, who arrived in Harlem from Atlanta in 1949, recounts an equally 
tumultuous life. 
</P>
<P>
She copes by rising at 5 a.m. every day and opening to the 91st Psalm in the 
Bible she brought from Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
"It opens up the day for me," she said. "It keeps me going." 
</P>
<P>
Giles needs all the spiritual sustenance she can muster. She has been a widow 
since 1967. Her only child, a daughter, died of a heart attack brought on by 
alcoholism and other addictions at the age of 45 the same year. 
</P>
<P>
Giles then reared her two granddaughters, one of whom, Marilyn, also an 
alcoholic, died of a brain tumor in 1987. Giles, who often had cared for 
Marilyn's children over the years, now has custody of Rochelle, 17, Randy, 15, 
Andree, 13, Eunique, 11, and Tenell, 10. Rochelle is pregnant with twins. 
</P>
<P>
Giles' other granddaughter also has had problems with addiction, and her two 
children are with their paternal grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Viola Jenkins, 63, has lived in the same apartment building in the South Bronx 
since she arrived in New York from her native Fayetteville, N.C., in 1945. Her 
husband, with whom she had four children, died in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, she has taken care of her grandson and granddaughter. They were 
placed in her care after authorities were tipped off that the children were 
being tied to the radiator in the apartment they shared with their parents, who 
fought often and were involved with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Every morning, after the children leave the apartment for school, Jenkins walks 
over to her bedroom window. She keeps a pillow there to rest her elbows while 
she gazes out onto Union Avenue and watches her two grandchildren until they 
disappear from sight. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see them almost all the way to school," she said on a recent morning as 
she craned her neck out the window. "If I try to walk them to school, they 
think I'm treating them like babies." 
</P>
<P>
She tries not to worry too much about the drug dealers who infest Union Avenue. 
She points them out as she gazes out the window at the desolate landscape of 
vacant lots and gutted buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"New York City is such a fast city," she said. "But coming from the South makes 
me strong. It gave me roots and a background."
