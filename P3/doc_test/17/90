manager, working his way up to general manager. He moved to the Antelope Valley 
in the early 1970s and continued in the same position at the company's 
Lancaster location until his retirement in 1968. That year, he and family 
members bought the Desert View Superette, a convenience store in Palmdale, 
where he worked until 1979.
