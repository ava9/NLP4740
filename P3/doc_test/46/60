Beijing and Washington have agreed to increase the frequency of their
military consultations in a further sign of improving relations.
The move follows President Bill Clinton's decision earlier this year to
sever the link between human rights issues and renewal of China's Most
Favoured Nation trading status. Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said
in Beijing that the two sides would enhance their military contacts in a
series of regular high-level briefings which would begin next month.
The US would lead the way in providing the Chinese with the briefings, he
added. 'Dialogue is in the security interests of both countries,' Mr Perry
told reporters after meeting China's prime minister, Mr Li Peng.
Washington has been pressing the Chinese military to become less secretive.
'We pointed out that transparency can reduce the concern of China's
neighbours that its modernisation programme could provide a threat,' Mr
Perry declared.
'I was very clear that we were not looking for secrets. It's strategy,
budget and broad planning where we are looking for an exchange,' Mr Perry
said.
The US had also offered the Chinese data from computer simulations of its
nuclear tests. The purpose had been to persuade the Chinese to stop carrying
out tests. China drew protests from western governments on October 7 when it
detonated a nuclear device at its Lop Nor test site.
Beijing has refused to join a Washington-sponsored moratorium on testing,
but says it is committed to a comprehensive test ban when this comes into
effect in 1996. Mr Perry made it clear his visit to China was aimed at
improving day-to-day contacts, to offset fears of a deterioration in Sino-US
relations, strained over such issues as human rights and arms proliferation.
'We are putting into place one dimension of the overall policy of President
Clinton's programme of broad constructive engagement with China,' Mr Perry
said.
Earlier, the US official had warned in a lecture to People's Liberation Army
officers of the dangers of an arms race in Asia arising from a proliferation
of nuclear weapons. Mr Perry called on China to exercise restraint in the
transfer of nuclear technology. The US has long suspected that Beijing has
been assisting Pakistan develop a nuclear capability. 'We are on the brink
of a nuclear weapons race on the sub-continent, where relations between
India and Pakistan have been tense for years,' Mr Perry said. 'As in Korea,
China has a huge stake in this issue, since it involves nations on its
border. With so much at stake, it is essential that countries with influence
in South Asia try to stop the potential arms race before it gathers
momentum.'
