  [Text] Geneva January 25 TASS -- Will nuclear weapons 
testing grounds be finally closed? The solution of this 
problem, on which politicians, military leaders and diplomats 
have been racking their brains for several past decades, may be 
brought closer by the annual session of the UN disarmament 
conference, which opened here today. 
  Having completed in 1992 the elaboration of a convention to 
ban chemical weapons, it is now getting down to the discussion 
of the problem of an all-embracing ban on nuclear tests. The 
session is being attended by delegations from 37 states-members 
of the conference, including Russia. 
  "The banning of tests is a very important measure, primarily 
from the viewpoint of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons," 
Grigoriy Berdennikov, Russia's permanent representative, told 
ITAR-TASS. "It is not a matter of concluding a treaty among the 
nuclear powers alone, but a matter of complete and universal 
prohibition of tests in all the countries of the world. This 
will guarantee us against the emergence of a new possessor of 
nuclear weapons." 
  The Geneva session is particularly important in light of 
current preparations for a conference of signatories of the 
nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty, scheduled for 1995. 
This conference may adopt a decision to prolong the treaty 
forever. 
  "The idea of fully banning nuclear tests was advanced by 
Jawaharlal Nehru in 1954. We have traditionally backed this 
initiative," Berdennikov added. "The treaty to ban tests in 
three media was concluded in 1963. We have also signed a treaty 
with the Americans to restrict the yield of nuclear tests. We 
are observing a moratorium on tests for several years now. 
Everybody admits that it has created a good background for 
talks in Geneva." 
  "The main problem after the end of the `Cold War' is to save 
the world from the `spreading' of mass destruction weapons and 
means for their delivery," the Russian representative said. "It 
is very important to reach agreement on security guarantees to 
non-nuclear state and on stopping the output of fissionable 
materials. The current session of the conference will also 
focus its attention on these problems."
