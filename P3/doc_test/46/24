  [Text] Moscow, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Deputy Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, on a visit in Moscow, said 
today that China respects the choice of other nations and hopes 
to develop friendly relations with all countries. 
  Qian was answering questions from reporters on China's 
policies towards Central Asian states. 
  Qian recalled that China had maintained friendly relations 
with the Central Asian region. 
  "As China and Central Asian states have increased contacts, 
we hope to develop such friendly relations and expect Central 
Asian states to expand their friendly ties and cooperation with 
other nations, including Russia," Qian said. 
  When asked about China's comment on Russia's effort to join 
the "Partnership for Peace" program, Qian said, "as a European 
nation and a big country, Russia has certainly maintained many 
links with the rest of Europe." 
  "Russia's establishment of a cooperative partnership with 
NATO is understandable, but it should be different from joining 
any military bloc in the past," he said. 
  "We hope it will help maintain peace and stability in Europe 
and the rest of the world and will not obstruct the development 
of good- neighborly relations between Russia and China," the 
foreign minister noted. 
  Russia signed a Partnership for Peace accord with NATO last 
Wednesday [22 June] to become the 21st country that joined the 
U.S.-initiated military cooperation plan. 
  On China's position about nuclear tests, Qian reaffirmed 
China stands for the total and thorough destruction of nuclear 
weapons. 
  China has unilaterally announced it will not be the first to 
use nuclear weapons, will not threaten non-nuclear nations with 
force and will not use nuclear weapons against them, he 
explained. 
  China has been very much restrained on the issue of nuclear 
tests, he said. 
  As a nuclear power, the United States has conducted more 
than 
900 nuclear tests; the former Soviet Union, including Russia, 
has done more than 600 such tests; France, more than 200; and 
Britain, more than 60. 
  In comparison, China has had the smallest number of nuclear 
tests among the nuclear countries, Qian added. 
  Qian arrived in Moscow Monday evening for a three-day 
official visit. He will also visit Belarus, Lithuania, Estonia 
and Finland.
