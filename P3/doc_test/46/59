  [Text] Geneva, Jan 25 (AFP) -- The 39-nation UN Conference 
on Disarmament opened here Tuesday with French Ambassador Gerard 
Errera denouncing North Korea's refusal to allow international 
inspections of its nuclear sites. 
  Errera, chairman of the conference, said Pyongyang's refusal 
cannot be "treated as only a regional issue." 
  He said the world's major nuclear powers -- the United 
States, Russia, France, Britain and China -- could not "accept 
to impose nuclear constraints on themselves if other countries 
continue to secretly develop nuclear weapons programs." 
  North Korea suspended inspections of its nuclear sites by 
the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in January 1993 and 
three months later threatened to pull-out of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, sparking fears that it was developing 
or had already developed a nuclear bomb. 
  Errera added that Iraq had also raised fears within the 
international community that it was developing its nuclear 
capability and that the breakup of the Soviet Union was 
threatening the implementation of the non-proliferation treaty. 
  There are fears that stocks of fissionable material have 
been 
sold or otherwise channelled from former Soviet bloc countries 
to countries secretly engaged in nuclear research. 
  The UN conference here, aimed at securing pledges from the 
nuclear powers for a comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT), is to 
set up an ad-hoc committee to negotiate the treaty. 
  The United States has already expressed reservations about 
Iraq being a member. 
  UN representative Vladimir Petrovskiy said Tuesday that he 
would be in favor of enlarging the committee to include 
additional members. 
  Errera, in his opening statement, also said that "today's 
reality does not reflect the past where two superpowers could 
negotiate between themselves a disarmament treaty and then 
present it for ratification by the international community." 
  The five nuclear powers nevertheless have their own 
reservations about a CTBT. 
  The United States, Russia, France and Britain have for 
example suspended their tests, whereas China carried out an 
explosion as recently as last October and appears in no hurry to 
conclude testing. 
  In any event, signing a test ban treaty would in no way 
imply 
that the nuclear five were ready to give up their nuclear 
stockpiles or abandon the doctrine of nuclear deterrence. 
  Errera said he could not predict how long the conference 
would last. "The main thing is that the talks should be taken 
seriously so that we can work towards a treaty acceptable to 
everybody." 
  It appeared unlikely that they would conclude before the 
1995 
expiry date of the current Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
(NPT) which the western powers wish to extend for a period of 
several years.
