  [Text] India has welcomed the major aspects of the January 
14th Moscow Declaration on nuclear nonproliferation as broadly 
what India has been advocating. India considers any step, big 
or small, aimed at general and complete disarmament to end all 
weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, as a 
positive development. It has, however, refrained from signing 
the present Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] as New Delhi 
considers it to be discriminatory. The treaty in effect tackles 
only the countries without nuclear weapons and not those in the 
nuclear club. The treaty virtually seeks to legitimize and 
perpetuate the retention of nuclear weapons in the hands of a 
few countries. 
  India's stress on general and complete elimination of 
nuclear 
stockpiles stems from its ethos. The land of Lord Mahavir and 
Lord Buddha has always believed in peace and tranquility and in 
avoiding the path of confrontation. During recent past, India 
achieved the distinction of having won its freedom through 
nonviolence. The world now stands at a threshold so far as 
stock piling of nuclear weapons is concerned. Even if there is 
no direct confrontation, the mere presence of these stockpiles 
poses immense threat to the security of mankind. World public 
opinion by and large has been in favor of complete elimination 
of such weapons and a ban on their further production. 
  Outside the arena of international politics, there are 
eminent personalities who have hailed India's demand for 
complete elimination of nuclear weapons and its refusal to sign 
the discriminatory NPT. Dr. Thanat Khoman, internationally 
known jurist and diplomat and Thailand's former deputy prime 
minister and founder member of ASEAN, said in New Delhi in last 
November that India did the right thing in not signing the 
discriminatory NPT. The London-based leader of Campaign For 
Nuclear Disarmament (CND), Mr. Bruce Kent, at the end of his 
two-week tour of India a couple of days ago said that nuclear 
powers do not have a right, moral or otherwise, to preach 
nonproliferation to the rest of the world. He said the NPT 
itself is not just about nonproliferation, but about disarmament 
as a whole and it has been made to look as if the whole issue is 
only about stopping non-nuclear states from crossing the nuclear 
threshold. The CND leader added that the nuclear powers have 
won pretty little to fulfill their own NPT obligations of 
shedding their own nuclear arsenals. The ground reality also 
points to this direction. 
  Far from eliminating their nuclear arsenals, the latest and 
the 39th explosion conducted by China on the fifth of October 
1993 has belied the hopes of even a nuclear test moratorium. 
The discriminatory nature of the current NPT is also clear from 
the fact that whereas the United States showed tremendous 
concern about Iraq's nuclear capability because it posed a 
threat to Israel, the same concern has not been shown about 
Pakistan's nuclear program because it is aimed at India. On the 
contrary, it is widely believed that Pakistan's nuclear 
capability was actually built somewhat within the knowledge of 
Washington. 
  Keeping the discriminatory nature of the present NPT in 
view, 
India has affirmed the need to alter the treaty on 
non-discriminatory basis. The NPT review conference is to be 
held next year and India has not accepted the suggestion that 
the treaty should be extended indefinitely and unconditionally 
in its present form. Public opinion, even in Western countries 
too, is (?gearing) round to a recognition that attempts should 
be made to dispense with nuclear weapons. There is now a 
growing realization in America too that the arms race made the 
United States the world biggest debtor. Both Germany and Japan 
have also started to question the discriminatory nature of the 
NPT. Japan has been the only country to have suffered the 
consequences of a nuclear attack and India in keeping with its 
commitment to general disarmament has urged Japan to take 
advantage of the opportunity next year at NPT review conference 
for removing its discriminatory nature. India has also asked 
Japan to join India in its initiative at the UN for a convention 
prohibiting the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons as 
necessary first step for the elimination and prevention of 
nuclear war. Efforts at nongovernmental level aimed at complete 
disarmament and a comprehensive test ban are also going apace. 
Former U.S. Defense Secretary Mr. Robert McNamara, has revealed 
in Bangalore recently that Indian and American experts have 
agreed to an action plan to work for freeing the world from 
nuclear arsenals.
