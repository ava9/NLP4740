2 SIDES SET TO RATIFY '70S NUCLEAR TREATIES;

ARMS CONTROL: YEARS LATER, TWO AGREEMENTS TO LIMIT UNDERGROUND TESTING WILL

<TEXT>
<P>
In one of the longest-running sagas in arms control history, President Bush and 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will sign protocols this week 
implementing two nuclear-test treaties reached a decade and a half ago but 
never ratified into law. 
</P>
<P>
Taking up only two pages, the treaties limit underground nuclear tests for both 
military and non-military purposes and have been honored by both nations even 
though the final details were not resolved. 
</P>
<P>
But the protocols to implement them fill 220 pages each, an indication of the 
technical and political issues that have bedeviled superpower efforts to curb 
nuclear tests since the treaties were signed in 1974 and 1976. 
</P>
<P>
And while approval of the two protocols probably will assure ratification of 
the treaties, the United States and Soviet Union remain at odds over what comes 
next. Moscow wants to ban nuclear tests totally, rather than just limit them. 
But Washington insists that some testing will be necessary as long as nuclear 
weapons are required for deterrence. 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear testing was the subject of the first U.S.-Soviet arms agreement in 
1963. Responding to an international clamor to halt aboveground tests that 
rained radioactive fallout around the globe, the two nations agreed to ban 
tests in the air, in water and, later, in outer space. 
</P>
<P>
The United States at the time was also prepared to limit tests underground but 
demanded on-site inspection to make up for the inadequacies of monitoring tests 
from distant seismic stations. Seismic waves from test blasts are hard to 
distinguish from earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
But the Soviets objected, saying that they feared the on-site inspectors would 
be spies. 
</P>
<P>
More than a decade passed before the Threshold Test Ban Treaty was signed in 
1974. It limits underground nuclear weapon tests to 150 kilotons, or the 
equivalent of 150,000 tons of TNT. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, the 150-kiloton limit was extended to non-military nuclear blasts, for 
such purposes as excavating canals or developing petroleum deposits, in the 
Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard M. Nixon resigned as President before he could submit the 1974 
treaty for Senate approval. Gerald R. Ford declined to send forward either 
treaty after he came under conservative attack from Ronald Reagan in the 1976 
GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's successor, Jimmy Carter, wanted to leapfrog both treaties by negotiating 
a comprehensive test ban forbidding all nuclear weapon tests. But when the 
Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979, the old agreements, as well as the new 
negotiations, were put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
As President, Reagan accused the Soviets of "probably" cheating on the 1974 and 
1976 agreements. He insisted on stiffer verification safeguards, including 
on-site inspections, before he would submit the treaties for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
Most specialists dispute the cheating charge, attributing it to Reagan's 
political suspicions and to technical errors in monitoring seismic signals. But 
the Soviets eventually agreed to new talks in 1987, on condition that -- upon 
ratification of the old treaties -- talks would begin to further limit 
underground tests with the ultimate goal of banning them. 
</P>
<P>
The principal dispute in the protocol negotiations was how best to measure the 
size of a test explosion. The Soviets insisted that seismic instruments 
implanted on or near the test site were sufficient when coupled with detailed 
information on test site geology. 
</P>
<P>
But the United States demanded the use of a new, intrusive and costly on-site 
measuring technique in which an electric cable is lowered into a parallel hole 
located within 100 feet of the shaft in which the nuclear blast occurs. 
</P>
<P>
Joint U.S.-Soviet experiments were conducted using both methods, and the 
seismic system was found to be at least as accurate as the U.S.-preferred 
technique. But the United States remained adamant, and a compromise was reached 
in which both techniques could be used. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of a comprehensive test ban endorse the new protocols as a means of 
moving beyond the old treaties to negotiate further testing limits. One goal is 
a ceiling on the number of tests. Another is to lower the threshold. The hope 
is that new weapon development would become more difficult, if not impossible. 
</P>
<P>
While the most vocal public demands for test bans over the years have come from 
the United States and Western Europe, Soviet citizens under glasnost, 
Gorbachev's policy of openness, are finally catching up and joining with 
testing opponents from the United States and other nations. 
</P>
<P>
Popular opposition at Semipalatinsk, the test range on Kazakhstan's bleak 
steppes, apparently forced the Kremlin to phase out testing there. Tests would 
only occur in Novaya Zemlya, a remote island near the Arctic Circle.

</P>
<P>
Key Points of New Testing Protocois 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of unratified 1974 and 1976 treaties, nuclear weapons test and 
non-military explosions are limited to 150 kilotons. 
</P>
<P>
For the time, the United States and Soviet Union will have the right to perform 
on-site monitoring of nuclear tests above 35 kilotons. 
</P>
<P>
Each side also can measure nuclear tests above 50 kilotons by seismic 
instruments or by hydrodynamics.
