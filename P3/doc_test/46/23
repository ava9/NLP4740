  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 6 KYODO -- North Korea's suspected 
nuclear weapons development and Japan's plan to shorten its aid 
programs for China are high on the agenda for talks between 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Chinese leaders during his 
weekend visit to Beijing, officials said Thursday [6 January]. 
  Hata, also deputy prime minister, will hold separate talks 
on 
Saturday with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Premier 
Li Peng, and will meet President and Communist Party General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin on Sunday before returning to Tokyo later 
in the day. 
  Talks between Hata and Qian, who met twice last year -- in 
New York in late September and again in Seattle in November -- 
will cover bilateral and international affairs, Foreign Ministry 
officials said. 
  The two foreign ministers will discuss the situation on the 
Korean peninsula as well as problems concerning North Korea's 
suspected development of nuclear weapons, the officials said. 
  Japan is likely to call on China to urge Pyongyang to accept 
international inspections of its nuclear facilities, since 
Beijing has the "largest official channel" with Pyongyang, they 
said. 
  In talks with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Seattle, 
Jiang pledged that Beijing will use its influence with Pyongyang 
"on the plus side" and would not exert influence that could turn 
into "a minus." 
  Hata may also urge China to agree to a comprehensive ban on 
nuclear testing, the officials said. 
  Japan wants China to engage in negotiations expected to 
begin 
this year in Geneva on a treaty for a global ban on nuclear 
testing. 
  China conducted an underground nuclear test in October 
despite Qian's speech at the United Nations General Assembly in 
September to open test ban talks as early as possible. 
  Hata is expected to voice Japan's support for China's bid to 
join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the 
officials said. 
  Hata and Qian will also discuss the two nations' roles in 
the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, review APEC's 
activities and also discuss the upcoming Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) regional forum, they said. 
  On bilateral issues, Hata will tell Qian about Japan's new 
aid programs for China after the current five-year loan program 
winds up at the end of fiscal 1995, in March 1996, they said. 
  According to ministry sources, Japan plans to shorten the 
duration of the aid programs from the current five or six years 
to three years starting in fiscal 1996. Japan has extended 
yen-denominated loans to China under five- or six-year programs 
since 1979, making China the only yen loan recipient under a 
program lasting more than one year. 
  China has been reluctant to accept a single-year program 
because it follows multiyear economic planning, the sources 
said. Under the current 1990-1995 loan program, Japan is 
extending 528.2 billion yen to finance 42 Chinese projects. 
  Hata and Qian may also discuss plans to conclude a bilateral 
treaty on the environment, which would enable Japanese and 
Chinese experts to conduct a joint survey on acid rain and other 
environmental problems, they said.
