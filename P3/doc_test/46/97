<F P=106> [Weekly news conference by President Fidel V. Ramos with </F>
domestic and foreign correspondents at Malacanang Palace in 
Manila -- live; passages in italics in Tagalog] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Ramos] I also have a 
statement in regard to the Korean peninsula nuclear issue. You 
will recall ladies and gentlemen that I made a statement on this 
just four days ago. But of course there are now new 
developments. 
  This is in regard to the still unconfirmed reports -- these 
are still unconfirmed -- that Pyongyang intends to withdraw from 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. And if that step 
has not yet been officially taken by North Korea, we urge North 
Korea to remain in the IAEA so that an early and peaceful 
resolution through patient negotiation and creative diplomacy 
can be found to resolve this issue. 
  Our concern here stems from the possibility of nuclear 
proliferation because such proliferation is a destabilizing 
factor for global and regional security, and in turn will derail 
and disturb and possibly [word indistinct] normal economic 
growth and sustained development in our part of the world, if 
not in the entire globe itself. And as a developing country, 
certainly, we want to move our economic, social, and political 
development forward without disturbances of this nature. 
  I also have a statement in regard to the reported testing by 
China four days ago, or 10 June, where a nuclear test was 
reportedly undertaken at its testing site at Lop Nor. And as 
you all know, as a signatory of the United Nations treaty on 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons the Philippines is strongly 
against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and this includes 
observance of a testing moratorium. So that in the end we hope 
that all of these tests will stop through a... or be made to 
cease through a comprehensive test-ban treaty. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent Manny Mogato] With Pyongyang ominously 
sounding the war drums and with Seoul (?gearing) to dance to the 
same music, in case of actual conflict between the two Koreas, 
the United States -- being committed to the defense of South 
Korea -- will certainly be drawn into the war. Mr. President, 
will the Philippines be also drawn into the same conflict by 
virtue of our mutual defense treaty with the United States? 
  [Ramos] No, that's very, very farfetched. You will recall 
that the Philippines joined in the so-called police action on 
the Korean peninsula -- which was occasioned by the invasion by 
North Korea of South Korea across the 38th parallel -- because 
of a UN Security Council resolution, not a defense treaty with 
any country. But before we could send our troops there, a law 
had to be passed, and this was Republic Act 573, the so-called 
Peptok Law passed by Congress in September 1950. So, it's not 
automatic that the Philippines rushes into the fray. After all, 
we are not the policeman of the world. But we have expressed 
our concern. 
  In my statement four days ago I cited five major reasons: 
  -- Because of our nonnuclear provisions in the 
Constitution, in the basic law; 
  -- Our membership in the IAEA board of governors, that is, 
Ambassador Rey Arcilla who is based in Austria; 
  -- Our proximity to the Korean peninsula. We are close 
enough, we are much closer than the United States; 
  -- The some 13 to... maybe more, thousand Filipinos in 
South Korea; and, 
  -- I mentioned it a while ago, the possible crippling and 
paralysis of economic activity in our part of the world. 
  In which, again, developing countries will become such 
a pity. The developed countries might benefit because of the 
war. What about us? Those are my concerns. 
  So, we have called for patient negotiation, consultation, 
and 
creative diplomacy so that perhaps we can find the acceptable 
solutions before sanctions are applied. 
  [Mogato] Follow-up, Mr. President. As member of the ASEAN, 
what do you think will be the role of the ASEAN in diffusing the 
threats of war in the Korean peninsula? 
  [Ramos] Well, certainly the ASEAN-member countries can take 
positions as we have done on a national basis. We are of course 
always in consultation within ASEAN with our sister countries. 
But as far as I know, ASEAN as a bloc has not yet come up with 
a position. Although in the recent senior officers meeting of 
the ASEAN Regional Forum which deals with security and defense 
matters, there was already at that level -- this is a lower 
level -- expressed the concerns of the ASEAN countries about the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons. [sentence as heard] 
  Of course, I think you are aware of the initiatives of 
Russia 
to convoke an international conference that will involve now the 
principal negotiators with the two Koreas. I hope that 
something will come out of this because this is really in the 
realm of creative diplomacy and patient negotiation. [passage 
omitted]
