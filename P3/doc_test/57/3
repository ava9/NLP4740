MR ANDREW Coppel yesterday took formal control of Queens Moat Houses and
announced the resignation of most of the board.
Only three of the 16 directors on the board when the hotel group's shares
were suspended last March are to remain.
The nine resignations follow the departure last May of Mr Martin Marcus,
deputy chairman, and Mr David Hersey, finance director. The two were
suspended in April after Queens Moat's bankers said they wanted to see
senior directors accepting responsibility for the financial crisis at the
group, which has debts estimated at Pounds 1bn.
The group said yesterday that Mr John Bairstow, chairman, is relinquishing
his executive position but will remain non-executive chairman until a
replacement is found.
Mr Coppel said he hoped to have a new part-time chairman by the end of
October, when the group presents its strategic plan to creditor banks.
Mr Coppel's decision to become group chief executive on a three-year
fixed-term contract was greeted with relief by analysts. Mr Coppel, a former
finance director of Ratners, the jewellery group, was appointed a consultant
to Queens Moat last April.
Mr Mark Finnie of NatWest Securities said Mr Coppel's assumption of the
chief executive's title was 'quite encouraging from the point of view of the
ultimate viability of the group'.
Mr Coppel said audited accounts for 1992 would be available in September,
after which the group would be in a position to begin thinking about a
relisting.
Mr Coppel said visits to the continental businesses and some UK hotels had
revealed that proper financial and management controls had existed in
Germany, Holland and France before the suspension of the shares.
They had been totally inadequate in the UK, particularly in the 40 hotels
run under the group's management incentive scheme.
A finance director for the UK business is expected to be appointed this
week.
Mr Robert Abson, Mr Peter Bertholdt and Mr Leo van der Meer, the directors
responsible for the UK, Germany and Holland respectively, are resigning from
the board to concentrate on their local operations.
Two other executive directors and four of the six non-executives are
leaving. Mr Gerald Bell, hotels division director, is to remain on the
board. Mr John Williams, the property group's managing director, is
considering his position.
The two non-executives remaining are Mr David Howell MP and Mr John Gale. Mr
Coppel said he had asked them to remain to provide continuity.
