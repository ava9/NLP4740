FT  05 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Imports cut into Dutch flower
power - One out of every eight roses sold in the European market is now
grown in Africa, Latin America or Israel

As Holland celebrates the 400th anniversary of the tulip this summer, the
horticultural industry to which it gave birth is being forced to adjust to a
most curious of commercial phenomenon - undercutting from a new crop of
African producers.
Cut flower growing has become a sunrise industry in the dark continent, with
Kenya and Zimbabwe leading an expanding herd of commercial farmers eager to
trade their dependance on cereals or tobacco for the greener fields of
disposable floriculture. Aalsmeer Flower Auction, the largest of seven Dutch
flower markets, reported a 82.5 per cent increase in rose imports last year,
while at the BVH auction a flood of foreign stems knocked 40 per cent off
rose prices during the recent winter season.
Low wages, zero heating costs and lack of regulation of pesticide and
fertiliser run-offs are all contributing to the movement abroad of this most
typical of Dutch industries. But the trend is also market-led in that the
selling peaks of Christmas and St Valentine's Day both occur when European
production is low and unit costs correspondingly higher.
'What will happen,' predicts Ms Margarette Worsfold, editor of the Flower
Trades Journal, 'is that the Dutch will suck in more flowers from Kenya,
Colombia and other producers. They take up all the current oversupply and
shove it through the auctions to make up for their own shortage.'
One in eight roses sold in Europe is now grown in Africa, Latin America or
Israel. Dutch wholesalers, with 59 per cent of the international flower
trade, welcome the trend as an opportunity to expand their market with more
competitive rates while preserving their margins. The auctions, which earn 6
per cent on every transaction, say imports pose no threat to Dutch hegemony,
although this is perceived less in terms of the interests of domestic
floriculture than the potential risk to the existing marketing and
distribution chain of high volume, non-Dutch suppliers.
But the 11,000 Dutch growers, who established the auctions as co-operatives,
have become increasingly resigned to losing the rose and carnation trade
altogether - the equivalent of 42 per cent by value of Aalsmeer's total
turnover. Though disdained as indicators of a market's 'floral illiteracy',
they remain the cornerstone of the wilting, but vitally important,
'occasions' sector of the retail trade. Selling the more sophisticated
products at which Dutch planters excel on the growing 'impulse' market
requires much greater strategic awareness.
'I think Dutch growers will always find varieties and niches in the markets
to make the whole assortment complete,' says Mr Niek Van Rest, managing
director of the Flower Council of Holland, the industry's promotional arm.
'You will see roses and carnations, in particular, largely taken over by
other countries but new varieties will still be grown in Holland.'
Nevertheless, there is much for the Dutch to celebrate in this anniversary
year. Aalsmeer, 15km from Amsterdam, is the showcase of a Pounds 2.2bn
business that ranks among the most competitive in the world. Some 20m stems
pass beneath its digital auction clocks daily in homage to an industry that
has successfully married the further shores of plant technology with a
distribution system so smooth that it has virtually eliminated distance as
an obstacle.
Though the double-digit increases of the 1980s are long gone, Aalsmeer
reported a healthy 4.8 per cent rise in earnings for the first third of the
year, incorporating a 2.7 per cent increase in Germany, Holland's biggest
customer, and hefty growth in eastern Europe and Japan.
Full implementation of the Uruguay Round settlement in General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade would further prise open the Japanese market while giving
greater access to the US. But the greatest growth potential lies in the
transformation of moribund 'occasions' markets, like the UK with its Pounds
19 a head annual flower consumption, into nations of impulse-buyers, like
the Germans who spend over Pounds 30 each on flowers each year.
The two keys to this kingdom are an educated consumer and a larger number of
retail outlets. Unlike Germany, regular flower buying has never been
promoted in the UK, but that could be about to alter as supermarket chains,
sensing the untapped demand, begin competing head-on with the traditional
high street florists.
While the multiples have the resources and sales points to grow markets like
the UK, however, they could also pose a threat to the eminence of the Dutch
auctions in international flower trading. Britain's Marks &amp; Spencer store
chain, for example, sources its larger orders directly from Spanish growers,
by-passing the auctions and their commissions altogether.
Aalsmeer's managing director, Mr Andre Mulder, is convinced there will
always be a commercial need for an international clearing house for the
flower trade but is concerned at the sheer scale of transactions taking
place at his market. Ten thousand trucks a day rumble through its caverns
and, on present growth, it will become unmanageable within a decade. In a
bid to reduce congestion, Aalsmeer introduced a video-based selling system
for pot plants in January, allowing growers to send only a sample to auction
with the majority inspected electronically.
Such a system is unlikely to be viable for cut flowers and for much the same
reason roses and gerbera will always be traded on a spot and not a futures
market, however great the volumes handled.
'Flowers are perishable products', says Mr Mulder, 'and it's not only a
high-tech product, but a high-touch product. So if you really want to do
business in the right way, you have to touch and see and smell the product.'
