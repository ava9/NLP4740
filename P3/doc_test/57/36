  [Text] Dutch Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans and his wife 
will soon visit Vietnam at the invitation of the Vietnamese 
Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam. We bring you a review of 
recent development in relations between Vietnam and Holland. 
  It is the first visit to Vietnam by the Dutch foreign 
minister. His visit will contribute to strengthening cooperative 
relations between the two countries in all areas. The leaders 
can consider future cooperation. 
  Vietnam and Holland have had established diplomatic 
relations 
since 1973, but with some interruptions. However, by late of 
1993, Holland decided to reopen its embassy in Vietnam. Many 
delegations from the two countries have exchanged visits over 
the past few years. Holland has developed many goodwill 
attitude to Vietnam [as heard]. At the Paris Conference, Holland 
was one of the countries which agreed to prolong the time for 
Vietnam to pay its debt over a 30 year period. The two 
countries have initiated an agreement on investment 
encouragement and protection. Vietnam and Holland have also 
concluded agreements on air transport and on river and sea 
dredging. Holland has a number of projects in Vietnam involving 
cooperation and investment. They have effectively cooperated in 
the field of health care. Now, they are hoping to cooperate in 
infrastructure building. Although Holland ranks the ninth among 
the investors in Vietnam, by now it has the 10 investment 
projects in Vietnam capitalized at $218 million, including the 
joint venture in oil and gas exploration, and another joint 
venture in producing Heineken Beer. 
  With existing relations, the visit to Vietnam this time of 
the Dutch foreign minister will surely be a landmark in 
relations between the two countries that help bring bilateral 
relations to a new level. 
  The Vietnamese people want to welcome this visit to Vietnam 
of the Dutch foreign minister and his wife, and wish it a 
success.
