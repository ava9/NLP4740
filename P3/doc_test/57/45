PRODUCTS reflecting the traditional British image and way of life are
selling well all over the world, but particularly in Japan.
You can't get more traditionally British than the royal family, and one
reliable sign of a long-established British product is the presence on the
label of the crest which indicates a royal warrant of appointment, awarded
to products favoured by the royal family.
J Barbour and Sons, best known for waxed jackets which cope with the worst
of British weather, is one company that will be adding the Queen's award for
export logo to the three royal warrants of appointment it already displays.
Its garments are sported by several members of the royal family, and its
brochure even advertises a Mark Phillips jacket for riders.
Barbour has found that Britain does not have a monopoly on the need for
bad-weather clothing, judging by the boom in sales across Europe, America
and Japan.
The company started towards the end of the last century making oilskins for
the North Sea fishing fleets. Now its 'Thornproof' waxed cotton jackets have
become a widely-imitated classic of country style. During the 1980s the
range expanded to include every kind of outerwear, from hats to socks and
all-in-one wading outfits. Most items are intended to be worn for hunting,
fishing and riding but in fact are often seen on the streets of London and
other cities.
Barbour garments are exported from the company's base in South Shields and
sold to 25 markets across the world, through wholly owned sales subsidiaries
in the main markets and a network of distributors and agents.
Fortnum and Mason is the biggest name in luxury foods in the UK, and because
of its royal warrant of appointment to the Queen it is often referred to as
the Queen's grocer.
Although Fortnum and Mason in Piccadilly, London, is its only store,
Fortnum's food products are stocked by many other department stores and
specialist food shops in the UK.
In 1981 the company set up a separate export division to cope with the
growing international demand for tea, biscuits and preserves carrying the
Fortnum name.
'The company's products have been enjoyed outside England for more than two
centuries, but in the last five years controlled expansion of sales by the
export division has achieved worldwide recognition for our range of quality
food products,' Fortnum and Mason says. Export earnings represent a
significant and increasing proportion of total turnover.
In Japan, Fortnum's has become known as a specialist tea house, and its
attractively packaged own-brand varieties of tea have high prestige value as
gifts. They are sold from concessions in many department stores including
Mitsukoshi, the 'Harrods of the East'.
Japan is also an important market for duffel coats made by Gloverall of
London, which also wins an export award. The duffel, a practical, warm
hooded coat, originated in Belgium, but was British military issue in World
War II, and became popular with students in the 1950s after Gloverall was
approached by the Ministry of Defence to sell off the military's surplus
coats.
Forty years later the duffel is still Gloverall's main product, and is
available in countless variations of style and colour. Gloverall describes
the duffel as 'the epitome of British style', but says its appeal is now
totally international. Gloverall has a 1.5 per cent share of UK clothing
exports to both Japan and France.
'Despite the current economic climate we are constantly setting new export
sales records,' said Mr Roger Morris, the chairman.
