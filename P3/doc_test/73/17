After running the venerable Mt. Wilson Observatory in the mountains overlooking 
Los Angeles for 84 years, the Carnegie Institution Thursday formally handed 
over the facility that was once the world's leading center of astronomy to a 
small Pasadena institute with an ambitious dream. 
</P>
<P>
The Mount Wilson Institute, a nonprofit group headed by Arthur H. Vaughn, a 
veteran astronomer, is seeking several million dollars in private funds to 
expand research and restore the facility's 100-inch reflecting telescope to 
active service. 
</P>
<P>
In a small ceremony in Washington, Vaughn said that -- despite the dazzling 
lights of Los Angeles a mile below the observatory and the occasional high-tide 
of smog that envelops the peak -- Mt. Wilson is considered the finest site in 
the continental United States for observing the skies. 
</P>
<P>
His plan, he said, is to put the observatory and its 100-inch telescope to work 
in a neglected area of astronomy -- the study of closer, brighter stars to 
better understand the turbulent behavior of the sun and to search for other 
planetary systems. 
</P>
<P>
"It is old, no doubt. But it forms very sharp images. That is what matters," 
Vaughn noted. With modern computer processing of its images, he said, the 
telescope's performance under some conditions could equal that of the 
billion-dollar Hubble Space Telescope that the space shuttle is scheduled to 
carry into Earth orbit in about a year. 
</P>
<P>
The most promising sources of funds, Vaughn said, will be private corporations 
and possibly public subscriptions. In return, the Mount Wilson Institute 
proposes to make the observatory serve double duty as a regional astronomy 
education center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Once the World's Largest 
</P>
<P>
The Mt. Wilson Observatory was established in 1904 with money from 
industrialist Andrew Carnegie. In July, 1917, a spindly truck wheezed up a 
perilous mountain road with a 100-inch mirror made of French wine-bottle glass, 
and four months later the world's largest reflecting telescope -- a distinction 
Mt. Wilson held for 31 years -- was probing the universe. 
</P>
<P>
With this telescope in the 1920s and '30s, astronomer Edwin P. Hubble 
discovered that what appeared to be nebulous wisps of glowing gas were in fact 
other galaxies, receding at unimaginable distances and speeds at the rim of an 
expanding universe. 
</P>
<P>
Maxine F. Singer, president of the Carnegie Institution, said it was decided in 
1984 to stop funding Mt. Wilson to divert money to construction of a mammoth 
new telescope in the Andes Mountains of Chile. The Magellan telescope's mirror 
is to measure 315 inches, making it by far the world's largest. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vaughn noted, reports of the demise of science on Mt. Wilson have 
been greatly exaggerated. "The public may think it's closed, but it's really a 
beehive of activity up there." 
</P>
<P>
Five research projects based at five universities are under way, financed by 
about $300,000 in federal grants, mostly from the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
But the observatory no longer has funds for its own independent scientific 
staff. Vaughn said that he hopes to raise the operating budget to about 
$750,000 a year, but that another $1 million to $2 million will be needed to 
bring the 100-inch telescope out of mothballs. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the National Science Foundation was there, astronomers knew how to 
raise money from private sources," he said. "We're going to have to learn that 
again."
