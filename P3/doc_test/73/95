tire, then crashed into the center divider, dumping 20 gallons of diesel fuel. 
The California Highway Patrol closed two lanes for 30 minutes while Caltrans 
spread sand over the fuel. Driver Gregory Paul Romero of Huntington Beach was 
helped by firefighters, above, then later treated and released from Tri City 
Medical Center. Passenger Walter Williams of Orange County suffered only minor 
injuries. TOM KECK / For The Times
