Why was Oscar de la Renta gracing the UCLA Art Council with his handsome 
presence and a view of his Fall 1989 Collection on the lawn at Hotel Bel-Air? 
He mused, "Well, Betsy Bloomingdale." Said Betsy: "Did he say that? How nice. 
Well, my daughter Lisa (Bell) is very involved with the council's Thieves 
Market." 
</P>
<P>
Saks Fifth Avenue hosted the event and underwrote everything. The elegant De la 
Renta, tanned from salmon fishing on the Cascapidian in Quebec, brought along 
his friend, Annette Reed, for the show, which was designed to boost the revival 
of the Thieves Market to be held Oct. 27-28 at Santa Monica Airport Center. 
That's the one co-chairs Marian Mandel and Muriel Simkin are pounding the 
pavement for, collecting antiques, memorabilia, art, silver, furs -- everything 
but the sofa. 
</P>
<P>
At the runway-end vantage point, Nancy Mehta, with a patch on her right cheek, 
sat next to Betsy Bloomingdale, Betsy next to Merv Adelson, Merv next to 
Barbara Walters. Fashion doyennes such as Mary Lazar (who hosted a party for 
Oscar and Annette), Patricia Ward, Pat York (with Michael), Helene Irvin (with 
Richard) and Patty Fox gushed over the couture. Gloria Luchenbill sang the 
words to "Begin the Beguine" as the couturier's black velvet dresses sashayed 
on the runway, and when the breeze billowed the chartreuse chiffon gown, she 
gasped: "I want that; I'll take it right now." 
</P>
<P>
Dinner dates followed: A coterie headed for the Bistro Garden, while Bernie and 
Lenny Greenberg and Bob and Laura-Lee Woods chose the Bel-Air dining room, and 
Joan and John Hotchkis with Annette and Peter O'Malley sped to Spago.
