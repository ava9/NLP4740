Photo, Vatican Telescope The structure designed for the first Vatican-owned 
telescope outside of Italy passed various stress and motion tests this week in 
Huntington Park, said Father Christopher Corbally, above, principal scientist 
on the project. The prototype of new telescopes being built by University of 
Arizona engineers, the new Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope will be put in 
place on Arizona's Mt. Graham in the fall. Five of the nine Jesuit 
priest-astronomers attached to the Vatican Observatory have worked primarily 
out of Tucson, reserving telescope time at other observatories. They will 
control three-fourths of the observing time at the new telescope. RANDY
