  [Text] A cosmic data transfer line for optical 
communication by means of lasers is to have its world premiere 
in 1997. Carl Zeiss Jena is part of the development. 
  The factory sale of reflecting telescopes was almost a 
matter 
of routine in Jena. But it was different for the 13th 1-meter 
reflecting telescope--not only because the signing of the 
contract in 1991 "coincided with the founding of the Carl Zeiss 
Jena GmbH company," as managing director Dr. Elk Littow recalls, 
but because it also meant the entrance of the Jena group into a 
new generation of technology. 
  With this telescope Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH is supplying the 
optical ground station for SILEX, the semiconductor 
intersatellite link experiment of the ESA. It is intended to 
create a prototype system for optical data transfer between 
satellites. By the end of 1995 the first ground station in 
Europe will be constructed in the mountains of the Spanish 
island of Teneriffe at a height of 2,500 m. It can produce a 
data link from the ground to a geostationary satellite using 
optical frequencies. 
  For ESA program director Anthony Dickinson, SILEX is an 
important step for the further development of commercial space 
travel. "No civilian space communications system has previously 
used laser light as a data link or makes use of the advantages, 
such as significantly higher data transfer capacity, good 
protection from interference and surveillance, and extension of 
the available frequency range for information transmittal." 
  This is becoming increasingly important. After all, the 
radio 
frequencies available in space have been heavily taxed. At the 
same time, power demands and size of facilities would be 
reduced, so that deployment on small satellites becomes a 
possibility. 
  Zeiss's participation in this innovation came just in time 
to 
save the 13th telescope and the attached housing with a diameter 
of 12.5 meters from landing on the scrapheap. The system had 
really been developed for astronomical observations and intended 
for the USSR. The individual components had already been 
completed, but the Russians could not purchase the telescope 
because of lack of cash. 
  A visit from the general director of the German Agency for 
Space Affairs (DARA), Jan-Baldem Mennicken, came to the rescue. 
The Thuringians were attentive to the fact that the European 
Space Agency (ESA) wanted to grant equal opportunity to 
companies and institutions in the new Federal Laender in their 
projects. The Jena group put this offer to the test by offering 
their system for the SILEX experiment. They redesigned the 
equipment under contract to DARA and fitted it with the most 
modern drives and control systems. 
  For its assignment had changed. In the SILEX experiment a 
new 
technological ESA data satellite, the geostationary ARTEMIS 
satellite, will be deployed. It receives data by means of 
classical microwave staellite transmission. These will be 
transmitted from the SILEX laser-optics communications system to 
the telescope. 
  In tests, the ground station with the Zeiss telescope is to 
simulate a future user satellite. The first real satellite which 
is to use the laser-optics terminal of ARTEMIS will be the 
French earth observation satellite SPOT-4. Generally it can only 
transmit imaging data to the next ground station for no longer 
than 10 minutes from its orbit at an altitude of 700 km. 
  This means loss of time: data carriers from stations 
overseas 
must be transported great distances for evaluation. SILEX, on 
the other hand, will always make uninterrupted links between 
SPOT-4 and its control center in Toulouse possible, as long as 
the satellite is within range of ARTEMIS, located 36,000 km 
above the equator. The data relay link to ARTEMIS is maintained 
when SPOT-4 flies over more than half of the land surfaces on 
earth. 
  The data rate of SILEX is 50 Mbits per second. ARTEMIS 
distributes the data received from observation satellites 
directly to users in Europe. 
  For this purpose ARTEMIS and SPOT-4 are equipped with 25-cm 
diameter telescopes for sending and receiving. These are 
supplied by Jena's former rival and current project partner, 
Carl Zeiss Oberkochen. Mirrors and structural telescope parts 
are not manufactured from the lightweight material graphite 
epoxy, but because of the required accuracy in measurement they 
are made of Zerodur from Schott, which has no thermal expansion. 
  DARA managing director Prof. Heinz Stoewer sees in SILEX--at 
present the only advanced civilian project in optic satellite 
communications--new dimensions for the communications industry, 
"one of the most important branches of the economy for the 
future." He says that Germany cannot afford to do without such 
high technology or to rest content with vanishingly small market 
shares in the long run. The civilian market for satellite 
communications will triple in the next 10 years, from $10 
billion to $30 billion. "German industrial firms are important 
sources of innovation. There is the chance for them to achieve a 
leading position in this area." 
  The Zeiss people in Oberkochen, who have sufficiently proved 
their competence in space projects with the development and 
manufacture of the optics for the X-ray astronomy Rosat 
satellites, are involved. The Jena group, too, has something to 
offer: the former collective combine was included in important 
Soviet space travel projects. Developments like the 
multispectrum camera in the 70's and astronavigation systems for 
satellites in the 80's are among their achievements. 
  Now the DARA contract was "enormously important for the area 
of astronomical equipment which is currently being 
restructured." Along with the new arrangement in the Zeiss 
Group, Jena has also assumed corporate responsibility for this 
systems area.
