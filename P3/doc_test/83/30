PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday set out a re-election strategy focusing on
attacks on the Democrat-controlled Congress, whose 'sorry record' he will
link directly to his opponent, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas. In a
pre-recorded interview with ABC News broadcast yesterday, Mr Bush said he
would take as his model former Democratic President Harry Truman, who won
re-election in 1948 by fiercely attacking a 'do-nothing' Congress.
Against the background of a Washington Post/ABC News poll yesterday showing
that 61 per cent of Americans do not know what Mr Bush wants to do in a
second term, the president sought to portray himself as having been too busy
in Washington dealing with Congress to lay out an agenda. Congress had 'let
me down and the American people.'
As the Republican party faithful began gathering in Houston for their
party's convention, which begins today, Mr Bush defended moving Mr James
Baker from his role as secretary of state into the White House to assist his
re-election campaign.
'He's been at my side in every political battle, and I think there's so much
at stake in terms of what we can do to help this country, that I wanted to
have this trusted friend and adviser, with a proven record, running the
White House.'
The president also said he would come forward with new ideas on education
programme, health care reform and taxes, so that voters had 'a major
choice'.
Convention speakers in Houston were preparing for a concerted assault on Mr
Clinton. Mr Rich Bond, the party chairman, said Mr Patrick Buchanan, who
unsuccessfully challenged Mr Bush in this year's Republican primaries, would
'tear the bark' off the Democratic candidate in his speech today.
