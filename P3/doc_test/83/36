COLD WAR: WE HAVE BEEN PORTRAYED AS INEPT DIPLOMATS, ROGUES, IMPERIALISTS, BUT 
U.S. STEADFASTNESS BROUGHT PEACE.

For more than 40 years the United States has waged the Cold War, despite 
ceaseless deprecation from many who benefited from American sacrifices without 
ever pausing to say thanks. 
</P>
<P>
Sophisticated Europeans such as Gen. Charles de Gaulle made us out to be 
reckless one minute and faithless the next. Through the decades we have been 
portrayed as inept diplomats, trigger-happy rogues, imperialists and, in the 
1980s, cowboys -- Hollywood cowboys, not even real cowboys! Now Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl of West Germany has expressed his gratitude, a wondrously 
appropriate sentiment. We who may now enjoy the benefits of peace should be 
grateful to many veterans of the Cold War, many of whom were Europeans and even 
Soviets.

There are the writers who braved abuse and poverty by exposing the brutal 
nature of communism. When Malcolm Muggeridge returned to Britain from Russia in 
the 1930s to refute such celebrated defenders of Stalin as the playwright 
George Bernard Shaw, Muggeridge lost his job, leaving his wife and four 
children on hard times. 
</P>
<P>
George Orwell was not accorded a much friendlier reception for blowing the 
whistle on the communists in the Spanish Civil War and for satirizing communist 
totalitarianism. Let us also express thanks to Arthur Koestler, whose "Darkness 
at Noon" exposed Stalin's show trials, and to Whittaker Chambers, who in 
"Witness" exposed communism's versatile evil and who died in despair for the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
And let us give thanks for the Cold Warriors themselves, beginning with Winston 
Churchill, who had the grit to notify the world in his March 5, 1946, speech in 
Fulton, Mo., of the Iron Curtain drawn across Europe and of the dangers ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Let us be grateful for America's greatest secretary of state, Dean Acheson, 
whose diplomatic career was crucial to the establishment of the Truman 
Doctrine, Point Four, the Marshall Plan, NATO, the end of the Berlin air lift 
and the pursuit of the Korean War. Let us be grateful for Presidents Harry 
Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, who kept the United States on an 
internationalist course. The academic treatise of George Kennan gave the United 
States a scheme for pursuing the East-West conflict, namely: "containment." And 
a remarkable collection of American diplomats implemented the policy. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years every President, from John F. Kennedy to Richard Nixon, paid 
an onerous price for waging the Cold War. In the 1980s Ronald Reagan faced the 
renewed challenge of Leonid Brezhnev and his successors and demonstrated that 
an arms race is a race the United States could and would win. If there was one 
politician who brought the Cold War to an end, it was Reagan. And if there was 
one writer to rouse the West to a final awareness of the horrors behind the 
Iron Curtain, it was Alexander Solzhenitsyn, whose pitiless "One Day in the 
Life of Ivan Denisovich" began the tolling of the bell on Marxism. 
</P>
<P>
But of course no one person can be cited for bringing to an end so epic a 
conflict. Millions deserve gratitude. For instance: the voters who supported 
the aforementioned leaders and paid the bills; the intelligence agents and 
military personnel; the dissidents behind the Iron Curtain countries, many 
still incarcerated; and even the Communist leaders who now seem to realize that 
their opposites in the West only want peace and prosperity for all.
