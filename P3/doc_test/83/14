FT  07 MAY 91 / Leading Article: The Quayle factor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is nothing like a president confined to a hospital to quicken the
pulse of US politics. Mr George Bush's release from one yesterday with
apparently the full confidence of his doctors ought to set to rest all the
obvious questions about the succession, but in practice it will not.
Suddenly there is renewed interest in next year's presidential election
campaign. What had appeared a mundane event, with the incumbent's return a
near certainty, has been rendered full of intrigue, for both parties.
The reason for this is Dan Quayle, the vice-president, to whom is attached
no sense of political invincibility or governmental desirability. The
prospect of running against Mr Quayle, as the man who might take over from
Mr Bush, is far more enticing than going against Mr Bush alone. Any doubt
about the president's health makes the vice-president, if still running
mate, an issue in a campaign.
Mr Quayle was a cynical political choice in 1988 and, thankless as the
vice-president's job often is, he has done little since to convince that he
is qualified to serve as chief executive in his own right. Some
vice-presidents have so graduated. Gerald Ford, much helped by an able
cabinet, did so after the Nixon resignation in 1974, while Harry Truman and
Lyndon Johnson went on to some great things, including winning elections on
their own. But Mr Quayle, on all available evidence, has nothing like their
experience or intrinsic qualities.
Widespread assumption
Mr Bush has not stated unequivocally that he intends to keep Mr Quayle on
the ticket in 1992, though it was the widespread assumption in Washington
that he would. With Mr Bush healthy, this would not have mattered too much,
since other Republican contenders would still have had plenty of time to
position themselves for the race to usurp Mr Quayle as heir apparent four
years later.
Mr Bush, it is to be hoped, will serve out two full terms, as did President
Eisenhower in spite of severe heart trouble and President Reagan after being
shot early in his presidency. But this latest reminder of mortality for a
man who pushes himself very hard means that the question of who stands the
proverbial heartbeat away takes on new importance. Presumably men like James
Baker, the secretary of state, Dick Cheney, the secretary of defence, and
perhaps even, if he is indeed a Republican, General Colin Powell, of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, will be engaging in quiet recalculation.
Enfeebled Democrats
The Democrats, on the other hand, have less need for discretion. After the
disaster of the Dukakis campaign and some underwhelming House and Senate
performances last year, they have appeared quite leaderless, even further
enfeebled by their opposition to the Gulf war. Normally, at this stage in
the political cycle, candidates have already begun to proclaim themselves
but so far only the quixotic - George McGovern and Paul Tsongas from the
party's left, old and new - have actively explored running. Not for the
first time, Governor Mario Cuomo of New York has started behaving like one,
though with plenty of room for withdrawal.
The conventional wisdom was that the only reason to run next year against Mr
Bush would be to put down a marker for four years later. But this itself is
a high-risk and expensive proposition, not lightly to be undertaken. The
landslide defeats suffered by Mr McGovern in 1972 and Mr Walter Mondale in
1984 were not long-term investments in the future.
But Mr Quayle is a different proposition from Mr Bush, as is undoubtedly
under discussion this week in Cleveland where the Democratic Leadership
Conference, representing the party's middle-of-the-roaders, is holding one
of its regular get-togethers.
Mr Quayle may wrap himself in the flag and the Gulf, but his power base is
essentially on the Republican right, which has been in progressive eclipse
with the passing of the Reagan era. Mr Bush, after the war and perhaps
before it, was a difficult target. Mr Quayle, relatively, is a sitting duck.
