One of George Bush's first acts as President was to pick up his 2-year-old 
granddaughter, Marshall, and give her a hug as he entered the inaugural parade 
reviewing stand Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall, shoeless in white tights, a dark blue dress with white lace collar 
and a white bow in her blond hair, promptly planted a kiss on the cheek of 
"Gampy," which is what 10 grandchildren call the new leader of the Free World. 
</P>
<P>
The scene was typical of the easy-going affection that marks the huge Bush 
family, whose presence has dominated inaugural activities this week. About 250 
children, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, cousins, nieces, 
nephews and in-laws streamed in from 22 states and three foreign countries for 
the big celebration. They filled up both a local hotel and every guest room in 
the White House Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comparisons to Reagans 
</P>
<P>
Bush, like his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, has taken the political posture of a 
champion of family values, and he highlighted them in his inaugural address. 
But unlike the Reagans -- who were estranged from their daughter, Patti Davis, 
and seldom saw Michael, or his children -- the Bushes exuberantly surround 
themselves with their family. Michael is Reagan's son from his first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
And it is going to stay that way, Barbara Bush said in a CBS-TV interview on 
the eve of the inauguration of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have our children and their friends over and our friends and their 
children over," she said. "We've done that every Sunday of our married life and 
we're not going to change on that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother on Hand 
</P>
<P>
Bush's 87-year-old mother, Dorothy, the widow of Sen. Prescott Bush of 
Connecticut, was on hand for the swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol, along 
with the new President's four sons, daughter and other kin. 
</P>
<P>
As he walked onto the inaugural platform, Bush leaned over and kissed his 
mother, who has been suffering from a bad back and calcium deterioration in her 
bones. She said after her son took the oath that she felt "very exhilarated." 
</P>
<P>
"I loved his remarks," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Bush spoke of the need to care for homeless people who are "lost 
and roaming," and for children "who have nothing, no love, no normalcy." He 
also said that there are "young women to be helped who are about to become 
mothers of children they can't care for and might not love." He added that 
"they need our care, our guidance and education, though we bless them for 
choosing life." 
</P>
<P>
As a clan, the Bushes tend to express their emotions freely, and shortly before 
the inauguration, Bush's son, George Jr., said in an NBC-TV interview that he 
expected it would "hit hard" when "I see my dad have his hand on the Bible and 
his right hand up, with mother holding it, looking out over the mall . . . . 
All of us will be restraining ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Son Neil added, with a laugh, that "we've had a history of teary-eyed" 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Before moving into the White House, about two dozen members of the immediate 
family stayed at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters across 
Pennsylvania Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush said that the family had turned parts of Blair House into a 
playpen. 
</P>
<P>
With grandchildren running around, "I wonder that some flying missile will 
clean out some plates over there," he said, jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
Amid toys strewn everywhere, Barbara Bush was observed by reporters Thursday 
playing "Simon Says" with the grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Draws Parallel to Mrs. Truman 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mrs. Bush said in the CBS interview that she has two goals as First 
Lady: "I'd like to make George happy, and I'd like to do my own thing." In that 
respect, she said that she would follow the example of Bess Truman, President 
Harry S. Truman's wife. 
</P>
<P>
George Jr., Neil and Jeb all have expressed interest in running for office. 
</P>
<P>
George Jr., 42, an oilman from Midland, Tex., ran unsuccessfully for Congress 
in 1978 and said that he may run for governor in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Jeb, 35, resigned his position as secretary of commerce in Florida to work on 
his father's presidential campaign. Now he is a real estate developer in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Neil, 33, is in the oil business in Denver, and Marvin, 32, is an investment 
counselor in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
The Bushes' only daughter, Dorothy, 29, lives in Maine with her husband, 
William LeBlond, and their two children.
