JAMES Baker is, according to those who never see him, moving might and main
behind the scenes to bring off the greatest political resurrection since
Lazarus (also known as Harry) Truman. President George Bush as good as said
on Sunday that he looked forward to having his good friend running the
nation's foreign policy again in a second term.
Some of those who have caught sight of Mr Baker in the flesh recently report
something different - that he is playing more weekend golf than he ever did
as secretary of state. This denotes, in the view of Washington gossips,
either massive confidence that Mr Bush will win or that only a miracle
beyond his earthly powers can save the Bush presidency from defeat a month
from now.
The second opinion was in the ascendancy yesterday with the publication of
new national and state polls. Their message was virtually uniform; that the
political balance in the US, having been volatile for the first 7 1/2 months
of the year, has become stable and that the election looks sewn up for
Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate.
A national Harris poll gives Mr Clinton 53 per cent, Mr Bush 36 per cent and
Mr Ross Perot, the independent, 9 per cent. The Washington Post/ABC News
split is 48-35-9 and that of the New York Times/CBS News 46-38-7.
An ABC 'map' of the 10 biggest states, comprising 257 of the 270 Electoral
College votes needed for victory, finds Mr Bush ahead in none, with serious
chances only in Texas and Florida.
Overall, it has Mr Clinton leading in 31 states with 367 college votes, Mr
Bush up in 11 with 71 and the remaining nine, with 100 electors, too close
to call. New state polls show Mr Clinton up by 20 points in Illinois, 19 in
Colorado, 13 in Michigan and Missouri, and seven in Ohio and Kansas. Mr Bush
is ahead by six points in Wyoming and two in South Carolina.
It seems that virtually nowhere is Mr Perot having any significant impact.
The New York Times poll reported 'overwhelming hostility' among voters to
his entry into the race. Nearly three quarters of those surveyed said he
should never have returned to the race.
This poll found that such limited support as Mr Perot was getting was drawn
equally from Mr Bush and Mr Clinton. The Washington Post survey, however,
found Mr Perot's presence on the ballot hurting the president more as it
offered an alternative to those strongly opposed to Mr Clinton.
But the worst news in all the surveys concerns the prevailing pessimism
about the state of the nation and Mr Bush's perceived ability to do anything
about it. The Washington Post, for example, reported that eight in 10
thought the country was headed in the wrong direction and six in 10 that the
economy was getting worse.
It found that one central thrust of the Bush campaign - that Mr Clinton
would tax Americans into poverty - was simply not working. Of registered
voters, 40 per cent thought Mr Clinton would do a better job on taxation,
against 28 per cent for Mr Bush and 16 per cent for Mr Perot.
The New York Times found the president's overall approval rating down to 37
per cent, a five point drop over the last month.
Only 16 per cent approved of the way he was managing the economy.
Mr Bush's best, perhaps only, hope now lies in the three upcoming televised
debates, starting in St Louis on Sunday. The president and Vice-President
Dan Quayle, who squares off with Senator Al Gore next Tuesday, have both
been playing down expectations. Mr Quayle has been somewhat embarrassed by
his assertion that his modest state education in Indiana could not compare
with the smoothness that the Democratic vice-presidential candidate acquired
at expensive Washington private schools. He was forced to issue a home state
apology.
There is an unpredictability to the debates, particularly in the extent to
which over-coached candidates find themselves thrown off course by the
unexpected.
Apart from the inevitable round of television interviews, Mr Bush took most
of the day off yesterday, preparing for the debates, while Mr Clinton was
still out stumping in Florida and Mr Perot put the final touches to a
half-hour paid TV commercial last night. As is now customary, Mr Baker was
nowhere to be seen.
