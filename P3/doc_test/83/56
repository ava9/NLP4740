KANSAS CITY, Mo.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Williamsburg, once Harry S. Truman's official presidential yacht, is 
rotting near a sewage plant on the Potomac River outside Washington and faces 
demolition. 
</P>
<P>
The vandalized, 243-foot-long hulk is covered with broken glass and empty beer 
bottles, the Kansas City Star reported. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing but a rusting hulk," said Richard Lynn, a Kansas City, Kan., 
riverboat operator who researched the possibilities of restoring the craft. 
</P>
<P>
If no one takes the former beauty of black steel, teak trim and mirror-polished 
brass, it faces demolition in July, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, the Williamsburg has had a variety of owners. It had a brief 
stint as a floating restaurant in New Jersey in 1969, and before that the 
National Science Foundation in Norfolk, Va., used it as a laboratory, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The ship became available about two weeks ago to anyone who could prove to the 
District of Columbia that it would be restored, said Kim Nielsen, chief of 
photography for the Smithsonian Institution's Freer and Sackler museums. 
</P>
<P>
"People have no conscience about destroying things of historic value," Nielsen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen is trying to find a future for the yacht, and he envisions the Midwest 
as its brightest hope. Independence, Mo., to be more specific -- Truman's home. 
</P>
<P>
But the idea of moving the Williamsburg to the Midwest is hopeless, local 
leaders and entrepreneurs say. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those cases where the powers that be have turned their backs on 
it," Lynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen estimated that even though the ship would be donated, the restoration 
would cost about $7 million -- more if the ship is to ever sail again. 
</P>
<P>
Dan McGraw of Independence looked into bringing the yacht to Independence about 
four years ago. When he finally tracked it down, it was privately owned and 
scheduled to again become a floating restaurant in New Jersey. The city of 
Independence dropped its queries. 
</P>
<P>
Then Nielsen called McGraw two weeks ago to say the ship was available. 
</P>
<P>
But now, McGraw said, "I don't think the city's going to get involved in it. I 
don't know what the city of Independence would do with it."
