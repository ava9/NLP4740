The battle for reform of the US healthcare system will reach its height this
week as Congress and the public get a full sight of the two principal
alternative bills on offer.
Today Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, will unveil his version
of healthcare reform for consideration next week by the Senate. It is likely
to be significantly different from the bill proposed last Friday by the
Democratic leadership in the House which will also go to the floor next
week.
President Bill Clinton has already pretty much cleared his schedule to focus
on the issue. Yesterday he was campaigning in New Jersey and tomorrow he
will greet the first of the bus caravans of reform supporters arriving in
Washington from all corners of the country to lobby Congress.
The president's weekend line during campaigning in President Harry Truman's
old home town of Independence, Missouri, was to urge Americans not to shirk
the challenge of healthcare reform and to praise the House blueprint, which
is not dissimilar to his own even though it is now being touted by its
sponsors as 'not the Clinton bill'.
Mr Mitchell, who conferred with the president yesterday morning, has already
given some clues to his thinking, both in television interviews and in
presentations to pro-reform lobbyists. He said he had urged representatives
of organised labour and the elderly that 'they should not let the perfect
become the enemy of the very good'.
As an inducement, he will propose that both prescription drug coverage and
long-term home care for the elderly be included in any legislation. The
Senate labour committee has endorsed this approach but its finance committee
has not.
But Mr Mitchell's bill will not compel employers to pay a substantial
portion of the insurance premiums of their workforces before the year 2002,
and only then if a combination of subsidies to small companies and changes
to insurance laws have not raised to 95 per cent the number of Americans
with insurance coverage. Even then he envisages only a 50 per cent 'mandate'
on employers.
The House bill, sponsored by Mr Richard Gephardt, the majority leader, and
very much along the lines of the measure already approved by its ways and
means committee, would require employers to foot 80 per cent of the cost to
achieve universal coverage by 1999. The president's plan also proposed 80
per cent mandates, to take effect by 1998.
Extensive subsidies to small companies to offset the cost are proposed. The
national Medicare programme would be extended to cover the unemployed and
part-time workers and those who cannot obtain workplace coverage, while
changes to insurance laws would make it much harder to deny protection to
those with long-term pre-existing medical conditions.
The real problem for both Mr Mitchell and Mr Gephardt is that each chamber
is going to be looking across the Capitol building at the other, with the
House especially nervous that it might end up passing a bill which, mostly
because of the employer mandates and the extension of Medicare, will be
unacceptable to the Senate.
That assumes, as is often the case because of its tighter procedural rules,
that the House comes to a vote first. But, with both debating
simultaneously, this usual order cannot be guaranteed.
No Republicans are expected to support the House bill, though Mr Mitchell's
less ambitious plan could conceivably win the odd vote from the other side
of the aisle in the Senate. Congressman Barney Frank, the Massachusetts
Democrat, predicted passage in the House 'because we have more Democrats and
fewer neurotics'.
Broadly speaking, the medical and insurance industries and most of big
business (except the car companies) are dead set against the House bill and
suspicious of Mr Mitchell's, though it may come to be seen as the lesser of
two evils.
