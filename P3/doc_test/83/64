FT  03 OCT 94 / Comeback kid shows no fight: Jurek Martin examines a
battered President Bill Clinton

Franklin Roosevelt created it, Ronald Reagan perfected it and it is now on
every US president's Saturday morning schedule.
It is a short radio report to the nation, from the White House or wherever
the president is, lasting no more than about five minutes. An hour later, a
representative of the opposition party of the day gets equal time to
respond.
There was more reason than usual to tune in to President Bill Clinton's talk
last Saturday. Last week, the Republican party's 'scorched earth' policy
eviscerated in Congress what had remained of his domestic legislative
agenda.
On Friday afternoon, campaign finance reform had gone the way of healthcare
reform. Approval of the Gatt trade treaty was put on hold - by a Democrat at
that, Senator Ernest Hollings of South Carolina. Bills covering cleansing of
contamination by toxic waste, western land preservation, housing, and
telecommunications were all dead or dying.
Even popular proposals, such as reform of lobbying and education, needed
respirators.
As the week ended, Democrats, like Senator George Mitchell, the majority
leader in the Senate, were openly apoplectic about Republican
obstructionism. The opposition, the senator charged, was determined to bring
Congress further into disrepute 'so they can inherit the rubble'.
Yet, on Saturday morning, the Democratic president did not even allow the
word 'Republican' to pass his lips. He did try to parade his achievements,
and bemoaned what had been lost, but the culprits were always unnamed
'lobbyists' or Senate 'filibusters', which, as every Congress-watcher knows
full well, have virtually all been orchestrated by the Republican party.
Almost as an indication of Republican contempt for the president, the
party's response, by Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, hardly referred to
Mr Clinton's remarks. Instead, it assaulted his policies on Haiti, which the
president had not even mentioned.
Mr Clinton's reluctance to come out fighting may reflect immediate political
concerns, not least the fate this week of the bills to reform lobbying and
education. However, by that token, he might even be persuaded to hold back
until the Senate has reconvened at the end of November to consider the Gatt
agreement - and that will not be until after the mid-term congressional
elections on November 8.
Survey after survey of US opinion shows the elections as likely to be
potentially disastrous for Mr Clinton and the Democrats, who now represent
the political establishment in the widely loathed capital.
Both the New York Times and the Washington Post yesterday carried extensive
analyses, pointing to the likelihood of Republican control of the Senate,
possibly of the House of Representatives and even of most state
governorships.
Some Democrats in rock-solid seats are now fighting for their lives,
including Senator Edward Kennedy in Massachusetts. Many have chosen to
respond by shifting themselves to the maximum distance from their president.
A mid-western fundraising trip by Mr Clinton a week ago was poorly attended
and its financial gain was disappointing.
In fairness, the electoral season will not really begin until Congress
adjourns, probably at the end of this week. Incumbents have been kept in
Washington by the heavy congressional schedule, though some, like Mr Tom
Foley, Speaker of the House, were forced back home at the weekend by polls
indicating the depth of their difficulties.
But, even if the public perception is that Mr Clinton is a drag on
Democratic candidates, a deferential silence from him in the five weeks
before November 8 might be yet more devastating. It would risk leaving the
impression that he is prepared to face two more years of Washington
'gridlock', which is the certain result of large Republican gains.
As R W Apple noted in the New York Times yesterday, this impasse with
Capitol Hill could be turned to the president's advantage in 1996, as it was
did in 1948 when President Harry Truman ran for re-election in the last
months of the 'do nothing' Republican Congress returned two years before.
But a more common view among Democrats, especially those up for re-election
now, is that it would be folly to let the Republicans 'get away with it'
now.
Mr Clinton, self-styled 'comeback kid' of the 1992 race, can still be a
formidable campaigner when his heart is in it. But, on Saturday, in front of
a clear target and a ready-made forum, there was no hint of fighting spirit.
His wife, Hillary, who also has much to lament with the loss of healthcare
reform, was at least back in political harness campaigning for her brother,
Hugh Rodham, a Senate candidate in Florida. But the nation still waits on
its president.
