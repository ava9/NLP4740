Marks and Spencer's chairman Sir Richard Greenbury does not have much time
for modern management gurus. He is more likely to turn for inspiration in
running his company to one of his heroes, former US president Harry S
Truman.
Part of the reason could be that Truman was a man after the spirited M&amp;S
chairman's own heart: 'He was feisty. He said what he thought.'
Perhaps more importantly, Sir Richard regards a passage in Truman's memoirs
summarising his thoughts on running large organisations as one of the best
management texts ever written. Truman, like Sir Richard, thought management
was largely a matter of good sense. Running a country was little different
from running any large body.
Marks and Spencer has had a century to shape its philosophy and style. It
has stayed close to its founders' principles.
The company grew out of a market stall in Leeds, northern England, set up in
1884 by a Polish-Jewish immigrant, Michael Marks. Ten years later Marks
moved to Manchester and went into partnership with a Yorkshireman, Tom
Spencer. They founded a string of Marks and Spencer's 'penny bazaars', with
the slogan: 'Don't ask the price, it's a penny'.
From market stalls to shopping arcade stores, the business evolved into a
chain of department stores and later into the familiar format offering
clothing and food.
The business was driven forward by a partnership between Michael Marks' son
Simon and Israel Sieff in 1915. They ran the company as a chain of stores
until the 1960s and laid the foundations underpinning today's success.
One was a policy of acquiring freehold and long leasehold properties.
Another was cutting out wholesalers and middlemen to buy goods in bulk
direct from manufacturers. A third was an emphasis on quality and
innovation.
As Simon Marks said in 1936: 'Efficient distribution is not a static
conception. It involves constant alertness and study of the changing habits,
desires and tastes of the consumer.' He might have had difficulty grasping
the scale of the company today. It has 354 stores, 72 of them in seven
countries outside the UK, as well as owning Brooks Brothers in the US and
Japan, Kings supermarkets in the US, and the D'Allaird's chain in Canada. It
also has 76 franchise stores in 18 countries. M&amp;S employs 62,000 people, and
made profits last year of Pounds 851m on sales of Pounds 6.54bn.
The guiding philosophy has changed little from Marks' time. Sir Richard sums
this up as 'giving customers the best value for money - that is the price
paid in relation to the (quality of) the good - and the best service.'
Sir Richard acknowledges his debt to his predecessors. He summarises the
strengths of Marks and Spencer as 'the three Ps' - people, property and
product.
M&amp;S has a reputation for taking on young people, training them, and keeping
them. Sir Richard joined at 16 and many of its senior executives are
career-long employees.
Staff are wrapped into a corporate welfare and benefits system which
includes competitive pay, and a non-contributory pension scheme which costs
the company Pounds 50m a year.
Sir Richard says M&amp;S promotes young talent and attempts to nurture
'mavericks and entrepreneurs'.
One of the company's most valuable legacies is a property portfolio of which
93 per cent is freehold or long leasehold - a great asset when many
retailers are struggling to pay rent.
The policy of buying freeholds continues today.
'Buy a prime freehold site and get the business right,' says Sir Richard.
'If you don't get it right, it's still a prime freehold site, and you can
sell it and kiss it goodbye.'
The third 'P' - product quality - is inextricably linked to Marks and
Spencer's relationship with its suppliers, regarded by many as the most
important feature setting it apart from its rivals.
M&amp;S was one of the first retailers, in 1935, to set up its own
quality-control and research laboratories. It specifies stringent standards
to its suppliers, many of which it has been dealing with for decades.
At the same time, by buying early in large quantities, it can get very good
prices. M&amp;S has a reputation for being a tough negotiator; Sir Richard says
it is hard, but fair.
Fairness, he adds, is another guiding principle. 'If I was asked the two
qualities that mean most to me, I would say integrity and fair dealing were
number one. Number two is courage, not physical courage, but courage to make
decisions and get on with things.'
The company's reputation for integrity - exemplified by its policy of paying
suppliers within 20 days and food suppliers within 10 days - is one of the
factors that has enabled it to expand into other areas such as financial
services.
As for courage to get on with things, M&amp;S is planning a Pounds 1bn
investment programme over the next three years to increase its UK floorspace
and expand its overseas operations. Its main targets are France and Spain,
south-east Asia where pilot stores have proved successful and, eventually,
Japan and China.
The pace of expansion will, however, be measured and will be through organic
growth and franchising, not through acquisition. Marks and Spencer has had
less than happy experiences with acquisitions. Its acquisition of Brooks
Bros in the US and Japan is regarded as a rare mistake. Many retail analysts
believe M&amp;S paid too much (Dollars 750m) for a business which is yet to
match the performance of the rest of the group.
As the business expands, Sir Richard says another principle will guide his
strategy. It is a principle he illustrates by reference to another of his
passions - football. 'I used to love the Brazilians, and I still love my own
team Manchester United, because they have a belief that winning is very,
important . . . but if you win with a bit of style it helps.'
