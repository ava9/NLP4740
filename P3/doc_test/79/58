<P>
The Italian Renaissance-style structure on Workman Street a few miles east of 
downtown is an architectural gem, honored as one of Los Angeles' most 
distinguished buildings when it was constructed in 1916. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the two-story, yellow brick-stucco building has become an integral 
part of the Lincoln Heights community as a Los Angeles Public Library branch 
housing about 39,000 books and a public meeting room. 
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday, it was on the Board of Library Commissioners agenda as one of 
10 inner-city libraries to be closed because of structural damage sustained in 
the October, 1987, Whittier earthquake. All were given closing dates Thursday 
except the Lincoln Heights branch. 
</P>
<P>
Five other inner-city branches, also damaged in the quake, already have been 
shut down. Four of these five have been moved to temporary, storefront 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The city, lacking sufficient funds to make the old buildings safe, has decided 
to close them until enough money is found to bolster them. The federal 
government and the city have together earmarked a total of $16 million toward 
the 10 libraries, but the city must come up with another $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, the Los Angeles City Council asked voters to approve a bond 
measure that would have provided remodeling funds for the branch libraries and 
the fire-ravaged Central Library downtown. But it was narrowly defeated after 
it was opposed by Councilman Nate Holden, who vigorously objected to including 
the Central Library. 
</P>
<P>
City voters will again be asked -- on April 11 -- to approve a bond measure, 
but this time the Central Library is not included. Holden, who is running for 
mayor, said he supports this measure, which calls for $53 million to repair or 
expand these and other old libraries and to build three new ones in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Heights got no closing date Thursday only because Department of 
Building and Safety officials have not yet submitted one to the library board, 
a library spokesman said. However, it is one of the branches facing serious 
financial problems -- requiring $1.3 million for reconstruction with, so far, 
only $250,000 in hand. 
</P>
<P>
The branch's librarian, Jose Taylor, said in an interview that he is optimistic 
that city officials will somehow find a way to save the historic building. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel they will come up with money one way or another," said Taylor, 58, who 
has been the branch's chief librarian for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
If the bond issue is again rejected -- it needs a "yes" vote of at least 
two-thirds of the ballots cast -- Taylor said he was confident lawmakers "would 
try again" to raise the cash. Simply closing down the branch was unthinkable, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Holden wondered why the library board did not wait to proceed with the closing 
preparations until voters can decide on the bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
Fontayne Holmes, assistant director of the library branches, said the bond 
measure would come too late to avoid closing the libraries for at least a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a ploy," Holmes said. "We would be dealing with this even if there 
was no bond issue. But passage of the bond will help us deal with this problem 
in a speedier manner." 
</P>
<P>
