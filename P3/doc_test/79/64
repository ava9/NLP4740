Horror film villains Freddy Krueger and Jason are better known to children than 
Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and Martin Luther King Jr., according to a 
survey conducted by the Champaign, Ill.-based National Coalition on Television 
Violence. Jason, the hockey-masked killer in the "Friday the 13th" movies, was 
correctly identified by 72% of the 100 10-to-13-year-olds surveyed. Krueger, 
the razor-gloved killer from the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series, was 
identified by 66%. King and Washington were each below the 60% mark, while 
Lincoln was only identified by 36%. The best-known historical or political 
figure in the survey was Vice President Dan Quayle, who was correctly 
identified by 62% of the students. (President Bush was not included on the 
survey.) Shauna Snow and ALEENE MacMINN
