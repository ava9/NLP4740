<F P=106> [Interview with General Paul Kagame, leader of the rebel </F>
Rwandan Patriotic Front, by Renaud Girard in Byumba; date not 
given: "Kagame Still Distrusts France"] 
  [Text] [Girard] Alain Juppe is envisaging French 
intervention. What is your reaction? 
  [Kagame] I have heard your minister's statement. I do not 
understand exactly what he is demanding. I do not see how an 
intervention of the kind he is considering could improve the 
situation. If France wants to do what we are doing itself, it 
would be better if it left us to do it. 
  [Girard] Do you not actually fear that the arrival of French 
soldiers might prevent you from continuing your action? 
  [Kagame] France's involvement in the Rwandan conflict has 
been proved. It has clearly shown that it is partisan. The 
return of its soldiers here would merely complicate matters. 
  [Girard] French policy has nonetheless changed from 
Mitterrand to Balladur. 
  [Kagame] In Rwanda, France has taken sides since the 
beginning of the war in 1990. This partisan spirit has 
continued over the past few months. I have not noticed any 
change of French policy. It has given its support to the 
so-called interim government, this regime of militiamen, and 
Rwandan officials have recently been received in Paris. France 
has not openly condemned the interim government for the crimes 
it has committed in Rwanda. And if France now wants to do 
something here, it would do better to wait for us to invite it. 
  [Girard] The French are nonetheless not responsible for the 
genocide of which Rwanda has been the theater since 7 April, 
when President Juvenal Habyarimana was assassinated? 
  [Kagame] It is obvious that the French are partly 
responsible 
for what has happened. France trained the militias and the 
Army. It has not condemned the assassins. 
  [Girard] What role would you agree to the United Nations 
playing in your country? 
  [Kagame] The United Nations can pursue its humanitarian 
mission, its aid to the populations that have survived the 
massacres. This is the maximum that the United Nations can 
achieve here. The Blue Helmets have shown themselves to be 
incapable of protecting the civilians who are being murdered by 
the militias. At present, I do not see who they could aspire to 
save by military means. 
  [Girard] Do you support the Security Council's decision to 
send 5,000 additional Blue Helmets to Rwanda? 
  [Kagame] It is a question which still has to be debated. 
First, the United Nations must clearly define its mission. Only 
then will we be able to tackle the question of the number of men 
likely to accomplish that mission effectively. 
  [Girard] But once the United Nations has clearly defined its 
humanitarian mission, you would not oppose the dispatch of these 
reinforcements? 
  [Kagame] General Dallaire (head of UNAMIR, the UN Assistance 
Mission in Rwanda) is in fact demanding 5,500 Blue Helmets. We 
think that is a large number. We are currently negotiating to 
arrive at a reasonable figure. 
  [Girard] What figure do you advocate? 
  [Kagame] The same sort of number that UNAMIR had when the 
war 
resumed in April, in other words, around 2,500 men. But the 
United Nations must first have a clear humanitarian mandate. 
What it lacks in this crisis is not numbers but a mandate. 
Otherwise the United Nations would have been able to protect 
the civilians from the start of the massacres. The Blue Helmets 
have always told us that they did not have a mandate to do so at 
the time. 
<H5>  `Minimizing Losses in Our Ranks' </H5>
  [Girard] Your movement, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], 
was known for its discipline. But the archbishop of Kigali was 
murdered by the RPF men who were guarding him. What is your 
explanation? 
  [Kagame] We still maintain very strict discipline in our 
movement. But this does not rule out some loss of control, 
individual crimes. You have blunders of this kind in all 
armies, even those of the developed countries. 
  [Girard] Will those responsible be prosecuted? 
  [Kagame] Of course. One of the assassins was killed when 
resisting arrest. Three others are on the run. We are actively 
seeking them. I will arrest the officer commanding the unit in 
question. He is not directly responsible for what happened, but 
as chief he is responsible. 
  [Girard] What is stopping you from capturing Kigali? 
  [Kagame] We are taking our time. We are making plans to 
minimize the losses in our ranks. 
  [Girard] Do you still refuse to negotiate with the interim 
government while agreeing to have discussions with the military? 
  [Kagame] Yes. But the FAR (Rwandan Armed Forces) have 
disappointed us. They do not keep their promises. Scarcely was 
the cease-fire signed than the massacres resumed and the 
civilians were prevented from going to the area of their choice. 
The general staff told us that they did not control the 
militias. But how can anybody think that professional soldiers 
are unable to control militiamen armed with machetes?
