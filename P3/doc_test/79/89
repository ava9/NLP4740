  [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
Li Lanqing, in meeting here today with Ian m. Rolland, chairman 
and chief executive officer of the U.S.-based Lincoln National 
Corporation, said that developing bilateral economic and trade 
cooperation is beneficial for both China and the United States. 
  Li said that China is the biggest developing country, the 
U.S. is the biggest developed one, and the economies of the two 
countries are mutually complementary. 
  Developing bilateral economic and trade cooperation is 
conducive to the economic development of the two countries and 
global economic development as well as to maintaining world 
peace and stability, said Li. 
  Developing bilateral trade and strengthening exchanges in 
culture and education between the U.S. and China are good for 
the two countries and their peoples, said Rolland, adding that 
he believes that the majority of the businessmen in the U.S. 
share the same view. 
  "We believe that more and more U.S. politicians will also 
share the same view," Li said. 
  Rolland said there is no such force that can hold back the 
momentum of the development of bilateral trade. 
  The Lincoln National Corporation, founded in 1905 and named 
after late U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, is one of the top ten 
insurance companies in the U.S. 
  Rolland said that his company is deeply impressed by China's 
economic development and is interested in its insurance market. 
  He said that his company will set up a Beijing office on 
April 28, and that they are looking forward to developing the 
China market. 
  Li expressed his congratulations on the opening of the 
Beijing office, saying that "a thousand-li journey is started by 
taking the first step" and that he is convinced that the office 
will experience good development in the future. 
  Rolland and his party arrived here April 22 as guests of the 
China Association for International Friendly Contacts.
