An original manuscript of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address was put back on 
public display today because tests determined the document has suffered no 
apparent damage from its years on exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency removed the document 
in August, 1989, to test it for decay and to evaluate the risk of theft. Gov. 
James R. Thompson protested the action and said the state would find a means to 
return the document to public viewing. 
</P>
<P>
The historic manuscript is one of only five remaining original handwritten 
copies and has been valued at $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Preservation agency officials timed the re-display of the speech to coincide 
with special exhibits marking the 125th anniversary of Lincoln's assassination 
Saturday, Blanchette said. 
</P>
<P>
"A fine balance must be struck between the public's right to view that document 
and our duty to protect it for future generations," agency spokesman David 
Blanchette said.
