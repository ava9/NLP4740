Worms - The French holding company's restructuring

THE history of Worms et Cie, one of France's oldest holding companies,
stretches back for more than a century. However, when Mr Nicholas Clive
Worms, the present chairman, addresses his shareholders in Paris today, he
will be talking about a completely new company.
A year ago Mr Clive Worms outlined Worms' new structure to his shareholders.
At today's meeting, he will be reporting on the company's progress in its
first year under its new guise.
Worms et Cie is one of the quintessentially French breed of holding
companies, with an assortment of interests in different sectors often in the
form of minority shareholdings that may carry controlling status.
It began life as a trading company in 1848 and swiftly diversified into
shipping. Worms et Cie retains the relics of the old shipping business, but
it is also involved in insurance, luxury goods, property, banking, sugar and
paper. It controls some companies, such as Athena, its insurance business,
and the Financiere Truffaut luxury goods vehicle. But it does not control
others, such as the Saint-Louis sugar and paper group. Until last year's
restructuring, its interests were even more diverse and split between two
companies, Pechelbronn and Simer.
Such company structures are common in France, where the corporate sector is
riddled with cross-shareholdings. Suez, the diversified industrial and
financial group, is another example, as is Compagnie de Navigation Mixte.
However, they tend to be incomprehensible to the international investors
which are a prime source of capital for French companies. It was this
concern that prompted Mr Clive Worms to restructure the group last year.
He made his decision against the backdrop of a disagreement with Assurances
Generales de France (AGF), one of the large French insurers and a long-term
investor which had wanted to increase its holding. AGF eventually agreed to
sell part of its stake back to the company, thereby reducing its holding to
8.2 per cent. Mr Clive Worms wanted to bring in other minority investors,
such as IFIL - the company controlled by the Agnelli family of Italy, that
two years ago bought a 7.4 per cent stake - to buy the old AGF shares.
'In France things tend to be very incestuous, with the same names cropping
up again and again as investors,' he said. 'We thought it would be more
exciting to go further afield. We needed a simpler structure to become more
accessible to international investors and also because, after our expansion
in the 1980s, we were a much bigger group.'
Pechelbronn and Simer were merged into one company, Worms et Cie, and the
group shed a string of its minority stakes. Truffaut, for instance, has
rationalised its portfolio by selling its stakes in some companies, such as
the Jean-Louis Scherrer fashion house, and reducing its holdings in others,
notably Christian Dior. Other holdings, including Suez itself, are engaged
in the same process. But they are doing so on a piecemeal basis, whereas
Worms has acted quickly.
Mr Clive Worms is convinced that he has achieved his goal of making Worms,
which recently announced net profits of FFr1bn (Dollars 186.9m) for 1991,
simpler and more efficient. Earlier this year he sold the rest of the AGF
shares to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which now owns 5.5 per cent,
and to Temasek of Singapore with 4.5 per cent.
The jury is still out on whether Worms has succeeded in making itself more
comprehensible internationally. One Paris analyst applauded it for the speed
with which it had rationalised its interests. Another said that 'despite all
the changes' it was 'still a mystery' outside France.
So far, Worms' share price has sided with the sceptics. It closed yesterday
at FFr341, well below FFr400 where it hovered immediately after its change
of name.
