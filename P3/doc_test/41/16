Do not be surprised by the paucity of published examples of computer fraud.
Perpetrators and victims feel it is in their interests to keep quiet.
Financial institutions, in particular, do not relish admitting that their
systems' security has been compromised.
Fortunately, the danger of 'hackers' breaking into corporate computer
systems is often exaggerated by the press and by security consultants; it is
nevertheless real.
Philip Swallow, a specialist in security with Andersen Consulting, says:
'Hacking is far from being a myth but neither is it endemic. Managers have
to be aware of the risks involved. Computer fraud by its very nature can be
difficult to detect.'
The European Information Technology Observatory (EITO), an organisation of
European IT companies, noted earlier this year: 'With the increasingly
pervasive usage of computers in all contexts and activities, the security of
information and of the systems that manage the information is becoming of
great importance.'
EITO points to two important developments in recent years: the definition of
security standards within the rules devised to allow computers from
different manufacturers to work together (Open Systems Interconnect or OSI)
and the establishment of criteria and rules for the security evaluation of
information technology products.
A critical point is that computer security is relative. It is possible in
theory to create a completely secure system, but cost and inconvenience
would make it unattractive. The level of security implemented represents,
therefore, a balance of business interests.
The diversity of ways of attacking a system lends itself to colourful
descriptions. There are trap doors (part of the software written in such a
way that the security of the system is compromised), Trojan horses (parts of
the software written so the system performs unauthorised and covert
operations), logic bombs (part of the software written to trigger an
operation at a subsequent date) and masquerades or piggy backs where a
fraudulent terminal pretends to have legitimate access to the system.
Most of these attacks depend on a corrupt member or members of the data
processing department. Only a software specialist with intimate knowledge of
a company's software would have the skill and opportunity to insert a trap
door or logic bomb. Systems compromised by trap doors or logic bombs are
difficult to detect; the very complexity of many systems makes it difficult
to check every program and section of computer code.
Attacks on computer systems from the outside are increasing. In one survey
in the UK, about a quarter of the companies questioned said there had been
unauthorised attempts to gain access to their systems. The National
Computing Centre in the UK estimates the average cost of a security breach
to a company is Pounds 9,000.
Alan Stanley of the consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand says the most recent
figures for the UK show that some 40 per cent of companies believe their
systems have been hacked into, although the damage level is low. Some 13 per
cent of mission critical operations had been compromised, but again, little
damage was done.
Measuring the level of security afforded by a computer system has been
simplified by the publication of evaluation criteria. The lead was taken by
the US in 1983 with the Orange Book; it provides essentially a set of
standard security measures for implementation by computer users each with an
indication of the level of confidence afforded.
European users, however, have never been wholly satisfied with the Orange
Book, arguing that it is chiefly geared to military systems. The European
Union has now published its own set of criteria, the White Book, which EITO
says 'could be considered as the beginning of European standards for
evaluating computer trust'. It is, EITO argues, 'one of the most significant
events in the last decade in the European IT security scenario and it might
cover the shortcomings and gaps of the Orange Book'.
The White Book evaluates systems in terms of their functionality and
effectiveness, with special reference to database management, process
control, exchange data integrity, high confidentiality and high integrity
environments.
The fact remains that computer systems, no matter how secure, greatly
increase the possibilities for fraud. Funds can be moved virtually
instantaneously anywhere in the world through computer networks. Is fraud on
the increase? There is a simple, positive correlation between the level of
fraud, the number of computers in use, the number of people who have
knowledge of and access to computers and the number of termin-als attached
to computers.
The Internet, the world's largest computer network with more than 25m users,
represents a special case. Designed as a channel of electronic communication
between scientists and technologists, it was intended to be as accessible as
possible. There is little in the way of built-in security. Earlier this year
thousands of Internet passwords were stolen giving the thieves access to
secret messages and files.
Now that commercial companies are taking an interest in the Internet for
communications, the question of security is more than academic. Managers are
becoming interested in electronic 'firedoors', methods of preventing
security lapses on the Internet from compromising their systems. An example
would be a minicomputer controlling access to the Internet, collecting and
authenticating messages.
Encryption is one way to make electronic messages secure but it is
controversial. The US administration was forced to abandon efforts to
introduce a special encryption chip, the 'Clipper', which would have allowed
pc users to protect themselves from hackers and fraudsters. Developed by the
National Security Agency and the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, its use would have allowed secret service personnel to decrypt
the messages.
