BANQUE Worms, part of the Union des Assurances de Paris insurance group,
fell into the red in the first half of this year with a net loss of FFr350m,
(Dollars 73.22m) against net profits of FFr90m in the same period of 1991.
Worms, like other French banks, has been forced to make steep provisions
(FFr353m in Worms's case) mainly due to the fall in property values.
Remy Cointreau, the French drinks group, announced that Andromede, an
investment consortium, has acquired two-thirds of its voting shares.
The future of Remy, which now has 31 per cent of its voting stock in the
hands of the founding Cointreau family, has for some time been shrouded by
speculation.
