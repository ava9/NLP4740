Ireland has suffered a mysterious invasion from the other end of the Earth that 
threatens to do serious long-term damage. The invader, which has spread out 
across Northern Ireland and is now entering the Republic of Ireland, is a lowly 
New Zealand worm called Artiopositalthia triangulata, which is slowly wiping 
out the native population of Irish worms. 
</P>
<P>
How the 6-inch-long New Zealand worm got to Ireland nobody knows. But it is 
thought that it probably arrived in Northern Ireland as egg capsules on the 
roots of a shrub more than 20 years ago. Since then it has proliferated in 
Northern Ireland and has recently been found on the southern side of the 
border.

<P>
The respected British journal The New Scientist reported recently, 
"Agricultural productivity in Northern Ireland could dip by at least one-third 
because a plague of flatworms has depleted the province's population of native 
earthworms by 90%."
