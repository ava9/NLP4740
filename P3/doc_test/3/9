Two weeks ago, the Isle of Dogs enterprise zone in London's Docklands came
of age. But its 10th anniversary, which brought the area's tax holidays to
an end, provided little cause for celebration.
The towering Canary Wharf development, which has come to symbolise
Docklands, is teetering on the brink. The failure of Olympia &amp; York, the
Canadian developer which created the project, would seal Dockland's
reputation as a developers' graveyard.
The area has been visited by the extremes of both success and failure. When,
in 1981, Mr Michael Heseltine, the then environment secretary, set up the
London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) to oversee the regeneration
of 20 square miles of derelict land, he described the region in damning
terms.
'The area displays more acutely and extensively than any other area in
England the physical deterioration of the inner city and the need for urban
regeneration,' he said.
Six years later, it was dubbed an economic miracle. 'It is seen as the most
exceptional development location in the UK and, perhaps, the most dynamic in
Europe,' said Mr Reg Ward, chief executive of the LDDC in 1987. At the time,
land values had doubled over the previous year, yields had dropped to 5 per
cent and the ratio of private investment to public money was 7:1.
But five years on, the miracle has turned sour. Docklands is seen as the
most costly disaster in the history of UK property development, following a
collapse in property values and a glut of vacant property.
It is also seen as a planning and architectural disaster. 'London's
Docklands contains one of the worst collections of late 20th century
buildings to be seen anywhere in the world,' says the Architecture, Design
and Technology press, an architectural guide.
Around the world, Docklands is seen as an example of how not to regenerate
urban areas. It was intended to be a model of what could happen without
government interference. But in practice, the government has heavily
subsidised the area through tax breaks and infrastructure investment: Pounds
5bn is due to be ploughed into east London's infrastructure by 1995.
Moreover, the government may end up bailing out Canary Wharf by building the
Jubilee Line railway extension, transferring civil servants to the area and
developing the East Thames Corridor.
The government's avowed goal was to cut red tape and give private enterprise
its head. Yet even the government was surprised by the way matters turned
out. The philosophy behind the enterprise zones was to attract industrial
development to the area. Instead, the LDDC decided to attract commercial
users.
'We used the enterprise zone in a somewhat maverick way by bringing together
our totally optimistic aspirations to make the Isle of Dogs an office and
commercial location rather than confirming it as a industrial one,' said the
LDDC's Mr Ward.
Under Mr Ward, a visionary, exuberant and headstrong character, Docklands
built up a powerful momentum. Tax breaks, advertising, the light railway,
the London City airport and the British Telecom satellite station helped
transform the character of the area.
The turning point for Docklands  - and with hindsight, its biggest mistake
 -was the decision to raise its sights and compete with the City and West
End.
The potential seemed obvious, however, following the arrival of O&amp;Y, the
world's largest property developer, which decided to invest Pounds 3bn in
Europe's biggest office scheme.
O&amp;Y recognised that London had the most expensive and old fashioned office
stock in Europe, which fell a long way short of the aspirations of potential
tenants. Tenants wanted large, cheap and high technology offices; the
Docklands provided an abundance of cheap, empty land, just 15 minutes away
from the City. The logic seemed impeccable.
It did not work out as planned. O&amp;Y had to offer generous incentives to
tenants; yet 40 per cent of the buildings within Canary Wharf which are
complete are still unlet. In part, this reflects the severity of the
property recession in London. But to a greater extent, it is a result of
London's haphazard approach to its own development.
This lack of an overall planning strategy allowed the City of London and
surrounding boroughs to relax their own planning controls, creating a glut
of space that undermined demand for offices in Docklands. The sheer enormity
of the Canary Wharf development put far too much strain on existing
infrastructure and improvements, such as better transportation, came far too
late. As a result, the image of the area was tarnished and Canary Wharf
failed to attract any big UK companies.
The Docklands experiment failed in other ways, too. It was launched in the
teeth of hostility from neighbouring local authorities, and it inspired
intense opposition from the local community. This was highlighted by a
Pounds 100m law suit from local residents against O&amp;Y and the LDDC because
of the noise, dust, dirt and disruption from the construction works.
To its critics, Docklands demonstrates the flaw in the Conservative party's
philosophy of urban regeneration. 'It is a fundamentally flawed approach,'
says Mr Bob Colenutt of the Docklands Consultative Committee (DCC), a local
authority association. The benefits of developments in Docklands have yet to
trickle down to the local community, he adds.
Three quarters of the jobs in the enterprise zone have simply involved
relocation of jobs from other parts of London; in total the enterprise zone
has resulted in the creation of just 2,733 jobs, says the DCC. Assuming the
cost of tax breaks and infrastructure totals Pounds 2.9bn - according to the
LDDC  - the DCC calculates that the government will have spent more than
Pounds 1m for every new job in the Isle of Dogs enterprise zone.
The LDDC, however, says that the costs of the enterprise zone have been
exaggerated and, furthermore, it is proud of its employment record: between
1981 and 1992 unemployment within the development area increased by 33 per
cent; in Greater London as a whole unemployment has increased by 47 per cent
over the same period.
Opinions differ on the future of Docklands. A substantial, albeit biased,
section of the property industry thinks it should scale back its ambitions
and settle for being a cheap location for clerks and computer installations.
'It should be like Croydon or Hammersmith,' says one consultant. The
problems of O&amp;Y, which may well result in the cancellation of the Jubilee
Line extension and the end of more development at Canary Wharf, make this
outcome likely.
The DCC thinks Docklands should concentrate on more modest development
including the allocation of half the Royal Docks for social housing. 'The
fantastic visions of the 1980s have to be reassessed,' says Mr Colenutt.
But the LDDC refuses to amend its plans, arguing that the DCC's ideas would
merely accelerate the spiral of decline. The LDDC sees the recession as a
chance to catch up on the development of infrastructure, which should
finally be in place when the UK economy picks up.
'London needs Docklands to enable it to remain one of the world's top three
cities,' says Mr Michael Pickard, chairman of the LDDC. 'Why should we not
be able to compete with the City of London and the City of Westminster?'
asks Mr Eric Sorensen, chief executive of the LDDC.
'Docklands will have important advantages in its communications,' he adds,
citing the following important additions: a broad highway running from the
City to the Royal Docks will be completed by the summer of 1993, coinciding
with the expansion and upgrading of the Docklands light railway.
The government's belief was that it could not justify building roads and
tube lines across wasteland. Its policy of no subsidies and no
infrastructure gradually turned into one of subsidies and infrastructure.
The message of the Docklands enterprise zone simply underlines what the
property industry always knew: infrastructure is the key to development.
