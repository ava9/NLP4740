ANY FUTURE owner of Canary Wharf would be held to an agreement to contribute
Pounds 400m towards the planned extension of the Jubilee Line Underground
railway if Olympia &amp; York collapsed, ministers insisted last night.
But, amid disquiet about the severe blow it would deliver to the future of
Docklands, ministers accepted that the government would face intense
political pressure to inject more public money into the area to sustain
confidence.
With O&amp;Y seeking protection from its creditors, the government faces an
acute dilemma over whether to scrap the rail scheme if the banks refuse to
meet, or seek to scale down, the developer's contribution. Officials
predicted an intense cabinet debate before the government agreed an
approach.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, could be expected to
lead calls for an active role in preserving confidence. Last year he fought
successfully for the routing of the Channel rail link through east London as
part of an ambitious strategy to spur the development of the east Thames
corridor beyond Docklands. But the officials said he would face fierce
opposition from the Treasury to any increase in spending to support Canary
Wharf.
Downing Street said Mr John Major was being kept closely in touch with the
progress of negotiations between O&amp;Y and the banks. Following O&amp;Y's action,
it is thought that his first priority will be to limit the political damage
but also to minimise any immediate commitments until the future of Canary
Wharf becomes clearer.
There was little surprise at the suggestion that negotiations between O&amp;Y
and its creditors might collapse, but there was acknowledgment in Whitehall
that the final demise of the developer would mark a severe setback for the
government's ambitions for the area.
The ministers said that the departments of the environment and of trade and
industry were still talking about the possibility of moving civil servants
to Canary Wharf. But, so far, O&amp;Y's package had not been sufficiently
competitive to match a Commons pledge by Mr Michael Howard, environment
secretary, that any decision would be strictly commercial.
A minister closely connected with recent talks insisted that, if Canary
Wharf went into admin-istration, the government would expect the banks to to
contribute towards the rail extension.
The government plans to inject more than Pounds 1bn into the Jubilee Line.
It argues that the Pounds 400m due to be contributed by O&amp;Y is significantly
less than the additional value that a rail link would place on Canary Wharf.
There is private acknowledgement, however, that there is no binding contract
to force O&amp;Y or any subsequent owner to contribute to the line.
