FT  14 DEC 92 / Decision on plans for Jubilee line postponed

LONDON TRANSPORT has dropped plans to announce a go-ahead for the
long-awaited Jubilee line extension to London's Docklands today because
there is still no sign of an agreement with the private sector over the
funding of the Pounds 1.8bn scheme.
One London Transport source said negotiations over the private sector
contribution were 'completely and utterly bogged down in detail' and there
was no hope of an agreement this year.
London Transport had privately earmarked today as the launch date for the
line in the expectation that a deal with the private sector would be ready
for signature by now.
LT's London Underground subsidiary still believes a deal will be reached. 'I
don't believe that, having got this far, we are going to stumble over
detail,' it said. 'But clearly it is taking a good deal longer than we had
hoped.'
The postponement of the Jubilee line launch coincides with the publication
today of a hard-hitting report by the Confederation of British Industry
criticising the government for failing to evolve an integrated transport
strategy for London.
The report is expected to say that any business given the job of providing
the best possible transport services for the capital would have been sacked
if it had done as badly as the Treasury and the Department of Transport.
Work on the Jubilee line extension was to have started in April. It was put
on hold when the Olympia &amp; York Canary Wharf project in Docklands, which had
undertaken to pay Pounds 400m towards the scheme, went into administrative
receivership.
Last month Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced in his autumn
statement that the government was still prepared to fund the bulk of the
scheme, but only if the private sector paid up.
Canary Wharf's 11 bankers have agreed in principle to come up with the
Pounds 400m, but negotiations over the terms have proved unexpectedly
complex and now threaten to delay a start to the project until well into
next year.
Issues holding up an agreement are believed to be the bankers' insistence
that the deal should incorporate guarantees about the timing of the line's
completion and its levels of service.
