FT  17 MAR 93 / Management: A fast track to efficiency - London's Docklands
Light Railway is now being managed by the private sector

Here is a novel idea for public sector railway managers. Tired of complaints
about unreliable trains? Easy: take Pounds 30m of taxpayers' money, give it
to an independent contractor and leave the private sector to put things
right.
That, at least, seems to be the thrust of the unprecedented deal struck by
London's Docklands Light Railway last week in appointing Brown &amp; Root, the
US engineering group, as its prime contractor.
Brown &amp; Root will not take over the day-to-day running of the railway. But
over the next three years it will manage the remaining stages of an Pounds
800m expansion and improvement programme. At the end of that time it must
deliver a railway that works. Its Pounds 30m fee is geared directly to
results.
The significance of the deal is that it is wholly uncharacteristic of the
railway industry. Railwaymen fervently oppose the notion that anyone should
come between them and their trains. They insist on controlling every aspect
of building and running the system, with the private sector's role limited
to that of sub-contractor and supplier.
But the Docklands Light Railway's managers are not railwaymen. Since
November 1991, they have been a team of defence procurement experts drafted
in from the Ministry of Defence. Their chairman, Sir Peter Levene, is former
head of defence procurement at the MoD. He also heads the prime minister's
efficiency unit.
When Sir Peter and his team arrived, the Docklands Light Railway was in such
disarray that the government had seized control of it from London Transport
and passed it to the London Docklands Development Corporation.
Its poor performance can be partly blamed on the fact that it was built on a
shoestring budget of Pounds 77m at a time when the government's ambitions
for Docklands were modest. When Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property
developer, proposed transforming Canary Wharf into London's third commercial
centre, the toy-town railway had to be improved.
When the government responded by authorising an Pounds 800m expansion and
upgrading of the line, the immediate effect was to make matters worse.
Already incapable of meeting the demands being made on it, the system had to
cope with being rebuilt while trains were still running. Consequently,
services deteriorated to the point of chaos.
But was there more to its poor performance than this? Today, the railway is
running 98 per cent of scheduled train mileage compared with a low of 67 per
cent before the management changeover. What caused such a drastic turnround?
Sir Peter says some simple manAgement actions produced quick results. For
example, his team discovered that the computer controlling the train
operations was overloaded. That was rectified through the seemingly obvious
action of trimming the train service.
Another step was getting to grips with the contractors responsible for
supplying track, trains and so on.
'Some of contractors were performing extremely badly,' says Sir Peter. 'The
DLR people said: 'We've written to them and asked them to do better, but
they're just not doing that.' I said: 'Well, let's stop paying them.' They
said: 'You can't do that - they'll sue.' So I said: 'Let them'.'
The result? 'Some sharp words were exchanged, but the performance of those
contractors changed overnight.'
To be fair to London Transport, it could be argued that the improvements in
the railway's performance might have happened without the change in
management. Conceivably, Sir Peter's team simply enjoyed the fruits of
action initiated by the previous incumbents.
London Transport, however, acknowledges Sir Peter and his colleagues wrought
changes. One advantage they enjoyed was the freedom to act without constant
reference to headquarters. Another was their reputation for tough dealing
with contractors such as GEC while at the defence ministry. Indeed, that was
one of the main reasons for bringing them in.
It was a logical extension of this last point that led to the decision to
appoint a prime contractor. The team is now applying the techniques of
defence contracting to railway projects, says Sir Peter. If the defence
ministry wants to order a new fighter aircraft, it does not deal with dozens
of contractors making all the sub-systems. It defines the performance it
wants, signs a contract for delivery with a single company such as British
Aerospace and leaves it to the prime contractor to deliver the aircraft it
wants.
As in the defence industry, so in transport. Sir Peter's team will no longer
deal with dozen contractors involved in the extension of the railway to
Beckton, the installation of a new control system and the supply of new
trains. That - and the integration of these parts into a smoothly-running
whole - will be Brown &amp; Root's job.
Is this the way of the future for other railway projects? Possibly. One
worrying factor, however, must be cost. Theoretically, a private-sector
contractor motivated by a performance-related fee will do a better job at
project management than a flabby public-sector body. But the Docklands Light
Railway only brings in Pounds 3m a year in ticket sales. Seen in that light,
Pounds 30m seems an awful lot to pay.
The cynical view might be that the government is prepared to nod the deal
through, hoping it will better prepare the railway for its planned
privatisation. So it might; but that, says Sir Peter, is not the point.
'The question is whether it represents good value for money. Everyone's been
satisfied that's the case, and now we are going ahead. I think we would be
criticised for spoiling the ship for a ha'p'orth of tar if, having spent
Pounds 800m on the railway, we had not spent another Pounds 30m in getting
it to work.'
