FT  29 MAR 94 / Light rail link open after long delay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Environment secretary Mr John Gummer yesterday opened the five-mile
extension to the Docklands Light Railway to Beckton in east London after a
delay of 18 months.
The Pounds 280m project to extend the railway has been dogged by problems
with construction and systems installation.
The extension, which connects Beckton with the Isle of Dogs and the City, is
funded by the London Docklands Development Corporation, set up to regenerate
the old docks area.
The extension takes the DLR to within a few hundred yards of the City
airport in east London but, in a hangover from the poor transport planning
which has bedevilled development of the area, there is still no station at
the airport.
Mr Gummer also launched the West Silvertown Urban Village, a development of
1,500 homes by Peabody Trust, the charitable housing provider, together with
the LDDC, the local authority and Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar and sweeteners
group.
The scheme, based on the Prince of Wales' ideas of integrated communities,
is being backed by the government's private finance initiative and will be
built over eight to 10 years.
