'NORBERT SMITH' A WITTY BRITISH PARODY

In "Sir Norbert Smith: A Life," a British send-up of the reverential TV 
biography, English comedian Harry Enfield plays an 80-year-old Olivier-like 
actor whose life and career are chronicled in an insufferably stuffy television 
retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
The parody, airing on "Great Performances" tonight (9:30-10:30 on Channel 28, 
9-10 p.m. on Channels 15 and 24) is delicious, managing to be droll and pungent 
at the same time.

<P>
Here's a show to tape and keep in your library and play back at parties. 
British humor doesn't always cross our shores intact, but "Sir Norbert Smith," 
with a swipe at the superior manner of British interview shows, is hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
The British are making fun of themselves here, but it's easy to imagine 
American celebrity TV shows, too. Barbara Walters' post-Oscar star interviews 
come instantly to mind. The high-toned interviewer prodding Sir Norbert Smith 
is smugly played by British TV host Melvyn Bragg, who, in fact, once 
interviewed Lord Olivier on "Great Performances' " "Laurence Olivier: A Life" 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Enfield, who's 29 and something of a cult figure in London, is a discovery -- 
for this viewer not unlike catching Sid Caesar on television for the first time 
in "Your Show of Shows." 
</P>
<P>
In "clips" affectionately staged by director Geoff Posner, Enfield's takeoffs 
on beloved British movie actors and their famous roles are ripe. Among other 
gems, the comedian (who co-wrote the material with Geoffrey Perkins) plays a 
gay, chain-smoking Hamlet "with additional dialogue by Noel Coward," and, in a 
commercial for a detergent called Sudso, recreates in a savory satire the 
doomed romance in "Brief Encounter." His Andrew Lloyd Webber impersonation is 
choice, too. RAY LOYND
