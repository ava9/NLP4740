A theatergoer in Pittsburgh found out first hand Wednesday night what it means 
to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. During a fight scene in 
the final act of the Three Rivers Shakespeare Festival's production of 
"Hamlet," a dagger sailed into the third row and hit Mrs. Patricia Spahic. The 
blade glanced her forehead, leaving a cut. Richard McMillan, who was playing 
Hamlet, immediately stopped the show and asked if there was a doctor in the 
house as the lights came up. A physician rushed to the woman's side and helped 
the stage crew escort her to an ambulance. The play resumed within minutes. 
Mrs. Spahic, 63, of Ambridge, was treated at a hospital and released. The 
mishap occurred during the fight in which Hamlet and Laertes both die. As 
Hamlet drew his dagger, it slipped from his grasp. ALEENE MacMINN
