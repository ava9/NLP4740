FT  26 MAR 94 / Lib Dems play down fresh race row

Embarrassed Liberal Democrat leaders were yesterday playing down the second
race-relations controversy involving the party's controversial Tower Hamlets
branch in three months.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, said attempts by Tower Hamlets activists to
achieve an 'ethnically balanced' election ticket were 'well-intentioned, but
misguided'.
Mr Ashdown was responding to disclosures that a ballot of members in two
wards in the Liberal-Democrat controlled east London borough had been used
to produce a mix of white, Asian and Afro-Caribbean candidates for the local
elections in May. The disclosures were doubly embarrassing for Mr Ashdown,
who warned last month that the politics of race must not be allowed to get a
grip in London's east end.
The issue is sensitive for the Liberal Democrats after the internal party
inquiry last year, which ruled that some of the party's activists in Tower
Hamlets had pandered to racist sentiment during the Isle of Dogs by-election
campaign. The poll was won by the extremist British National Party (BNP),
which could win further east London seats in May.
Mr Graham Tope, president of the Liberal Democrat's London region, said the
Tower Hamlets party was trying to fight racism by fielding a slate of
candidates reflecting the borough's complex ethnic mix.
'There was no attempt to be racist by anyone,' he said. 'Their view was that
a balanced ticket reflecting the makeup of the area was the best way of
defeating the BNP.'
Tower Hamlets party leaders are expected to meet tomorrow to recount the
ballot results without regard to ethnic background.
