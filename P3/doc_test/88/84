  [Text] John Major's grip on the Tory leadership was visibly 
weakened today after a night in which his shattered party 
surrendered some of its prized possessions. 
  Britain's most dramatic local government elections for 
decades became the Conservatives' worst and most humiliating 
showing of all time, as the Liberal Democrats swept to victory 
after victory, with Labour making some surprising gains as well. 
  Conservatives stood by helpless as their power sensationally 
deserted them in some of their most diehard heartlands. Now 
they face a nerve-racking five weeks before the Euro-elections, 
where all the signs point to further setbacks and catastrophes. 
By 6am Labour had made a net gain of four councils, the Liberal 
Democrats had made a net gain of nine councils and the Tories 
had made a net loss of 17 councils. 
  In an astonishing catalogue of misery, the Tories lost 
control of, or failed to capture, a series of authorities which 
for decades have been Tory through and through. These 
included: the flagship Basildon, the Essex seat which epitomises 
Toryism, Epping Forest, Woking, Worthing, Birmingham, 
Stratford-upon-Avon, Southend, Enfield and Croydon -- where they 
have held power for more than a century -- and even Tunbridge 
Wells. 
  Now, the clamour will mount -- possibly irresistibly -- for 
a 
leadership election in the autumn, even though Tory business 
managers will warn dissidents that a challenge will plunge the 
party into even further and possibly irreparable disarray. But 
Michael Portillo, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and the 
choice of the Right to succeed Mr Major, insisted that the 
night's "disappointments" would have the reverse effect and 
rally the party behind the leader. 
  If the pattern of yesterday's voting is repeated at the 
Euro- 
elections, experts have predicted that Labour leader John Smith 
would have 55 of the 86 seats, Mr Major would have 18, and Paddy 
Ashdown 10. Repeated in a general election, today's figures 
would also give Labour a massive 125 overall majority in the 
House of Commons. 
  At the Liberal Democrat headquarters the party celebrated a 
night of triumphs -- flawed only by a blemish at the troubled 
East End Tower Hamlets council, the scene of allegations of 
racist campaigning. And jubilant Labour not only ousted the 
Liberal Democrats from control, but celebrated, too, their 
defeat of the British National Party in the Millwall ward -- 
"the most important ward in Britain tonight", said Frank Dobson, 
Labour's election coordinator. The Liberal Democrat trophies 
included Eastleigh in Hampshire -- where the Tories will soon be 
defending a vital parliamentary by-election. All the signs are 
now that the Conservatives' 17,000-plus majority at the general 
election will be wiped out by Paddy Ashdown's party. Paddy 
Ashdown was in ebullient mood. He told PA News: "The Liberal 
Democrats are the clear winners in these elections. This has 
been a vote of confidence in the Liberal Democrat councils, 
councillors and campaigners." The Liberal Democrat roll of 
triumph is Worthing (from the Conservatives) plus, Bath, 
Colchester, Congleton, Eastleigh, Kingston-upon-Thames, Mole 
Valley, Rochford, St Albans and Winchester, all of which had no 
overall control. 
  The Tory loss of Basildon, where John Major personally 
campaigned, was a bitter blow. But even worse was the failure 
to capture Birmingham from Labour, whose management of the city 
has been pilloried ceaselessly and without mercy by ministers. 
Birmingham was Target Number One on the Tory hit-list. But 
Labour managed to keep control. Labour gained Croydon, Enfield 
and Welwyn Hatfield from the Tories. Croydon was a special 
prize, in that it has been in Tory hands for more than a 
century. And the victory at Enfield is a direct body-blow for 
Michael Portillo, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Tories' 
London election coordinator. But Labour lost control at 
Kirklees, Oldham and Pendle. Even so, John Smith the Opposition 
leader, commented: "This has been a splendid night for Labour. 
"We have achieved far more than could have been expected, in 
particular the stunning victories in Croydon and Enfield, a 
swing to Labour in Birmingham and the destruction of the 
Liberals in Tower Hamlets." 
  Conservative chairman Sir Norman Fowler's assertion that 
they 
would emerge with net gains now has a hollow ring about it. But 
he underlined his view -- shared by Michael Portillo -- that the 
Prime Minister is safe in his job. Mr Portillo said the night's 
"disappointments" meant that the party would rally behind the 
Prime Minister. "These are disappointing mid-term results. 
But we will recover from them. What has happened is that some 
Conservative voters stayed at home. They did not transfer over 
to Labour."
