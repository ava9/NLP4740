AS I climbed the path to the great rampart surrounding Broadmoor Hospital,
the air was suddenly filled with the shriek of a siren. I clutched my
folding umbrella more tightly, expecting every moment to see wild-eyed
figures clambering over the high brick wall in front of me.
'Just a test,' said the man at the main gate. 'We do it every Monday
morning.'
Nobody entering this 130-year-old asylum for the criminally insane can avoid
a shiver of voyeuristic apprehension. Not all of the 500 occupants, men and
women, have killed. But many have, and some of their names are known to
every newspaper reader in Britain.
Inside the walls, the place is more spacious, quiet, clean and modern than a
jail - no sign of state penny-pinching here - and enjoys a panoramic
southward view over Berkshire and Hampshire. I began to forget Broadmoor's
fearsome reputation and the recent allegations of cruelty by a former
resident doctor.
I began to believe, instead, in the truth of a book which movingly describes
an extraordinary experiment which has been going on here for the past three
years.
The author of the experiment and editor of the book is Dr Murray Cox,
consultant psychotherapist and Shakespearean scholar.
In 1989, as a result of a chance meeting between Dr Cox and the actor Mark
Rylance, then doing a season with the Royal Shakespeare Company, Hamlet was
performed in front of 105 Broadmoor patients. That was followed by the RSC's
Romeo and Juliet, a local amateur group's Measure for Measure, the National
Theatre's King Lear and, most recently, the RSC's performance of A Woman
Killed with Kindness by Thomas Heywood.
Now Aristotle, as every theatre-goer knows, described the purpose of Greek
tragedy as 'catharsis': the purging of the audience's emotions through the
dramatic depiction of pity and terror.
But there was something shocking about the idea of showing madness,
mutilation and murder - I thought of the scene in King Lear where
Gloucester's eyes are gouged out - to people with a psychotic or
psychopathic condition, whose own horrifying deeds had caused them to be
locked away.
Dr Cox demurred. 'What this is doing, I think, is opening up a safe way for
people to face unfaceable things in their inner world.'
He explained that psychotics (mostly schizophrenic) need more protection
from the real world than confrontation with it, whereas psychopaths need
both.
'Watching first-class drama is an encounter with truth of all kinds. It is
one of the great aspects of drama that it gives you the support and the
confrontation in an interesting amalgam.'
Interviewing Dr Cox, I found it impossible to pursue a straight line. His
discourse spun like a Catherine wheel and he threw off quotations from
Shakespeare and other poets like sparks. At one point, I entirely lost the
drift and apologised for the fact that we were going round in circles.
He was delighted. 'Absolutely. We go in spirals actually. Spirals are very
important. It's like therapy in some ways. You think you're going in circles
but actually you're going in spirals and you get deeper and deeper into the
material.'
Dr Cox was reticent about his own life. Apparently, it can damage a
psychiatrist's relationship with his patient if he discloses too much about
himself and, Dr Cox assured me, the Broadmoor patients would be reading the
interview.
But I learned that he read medicine at Cambridge University and was a
general practitioner for 10 years until his interest in poetry and language
and the way patients talked about themselves - the 'deictic stress' or
signalling function of their words - took him first into prison psychiatry
and then, in 1970, to Broadmoor.
Bringing Shakespeare himself to Broadmoor had been therapeutic, he said, but
it had not been designed as 'dramatherapy'.
Did you think it would be good for patients to see enactments of their own
offences? I asked.
'Yes, I did think that; but then it's good for all of us to see enactments.
This is not something special for patients here. Ibsen, for instance, is
full of the idea that there are things people just don't do. But people are
always doing things that 'people just don't do'.'
I asked about what seemed to me the obvious dangers. Are there people here
for whom seeing these plays is a mistake?
'I'm not sure you can say that. Their own defence mechanisms would on the
whole have defended them against seeing what they weren't ready to see.
There is a sense in which we are kept at a distance from what is perceivable
because it is too horrific.
'Gradually during psychotherapy and maturation and a hundred and one other
things one can gradually . . . let's go to Macbeth: I am afraid to think
what I have done. To look on't again I dare not. Or again: But when we have
our naked frailties hid, that suffer in exposure, let us meet again and
question this most bloody piece of work to know it further.'
Cox told me that many patients had televisions and could watch whatever they
wished. I asked: Including scenes of violence and rape?
'But we all know that every news bulletin has the most horrific scenes. This
is part of the web of life that we're all in and it's something that's woven
into virtually every therapeutic session here. This is the human predicament
and in a curious way one needs to undramatise a great deal of it because the
offences - it may be one act, years ago, and of course it's very serious -
are part of life too.'
Why didn't you start with Alan Ayckbourn and work up, so to speak?
'That's a very good question. It just so happened that Mark Rylance said it
would be good if we could come to Broadmoor. It was totally an accident . .
. That's a good Shakespearean word,' he mused.
But why tragedies?
'I happened to meet Mark and he happened to be playing Hamlet and Romeo that
year.'
Are there disadvantages in this experiment?
Dr. Cox pondered. 'I'm thinking of this word experiment . . . Is it an
experiment? Yes, it is . . . One negative would be if it ever became
compulsory.'
Would it be a negative if actors got a thrill out of performing in front of
a lot of homicidal maniacs?
'Those are your words, not mine. I think that would wear off very quickly.
In the workshops afterwards, both groups quickly recognised the other as
human beings and the homicidal maniac stereotype simply vanished.
Paradoxically, it was almost a de-dramatising of patients in Broadmoor and
of actors, too.'
How do you answer the charge that you are just curious to see how patients
will react, and the actors are curious to see what killers look like close
up?
'That is a charge which could be levelled and if that is the overall
impression people get, I'm sorry, but it just isn't like that. I can tell
you it just isn't so.'
At this point I used the word 'inmate' and got a severe ticking off. However
neutral the dictionary definition, at Broadmoor the word is verboten.
'This is definitely a hospital. I mean, seriously. It is a secure
psychiatric hospital and the people here are patients.'
Of course, I resumed, if you show murder on the stage to murderers it's
bound to make a big impact . . .
'But that's the point. We're not showing murder on the stage. What we are
doing is performing Hamlet. To say that is showing murder on the stage is
taking one small fragment of a hugely important drama. I'm well aware this
is an extremely important point. What you see is Shakespeare's huge
presentation of life: he's not simply demonstrating murder . . .'
There was a knock on the door and one of Dr Cox's colleagues poked her head
in to ask a question. When the door shut he asked: 'Where were we?' and
immediately plucked out another quotation, from Richard II: Where was I when
weeping made me break the story off? This led to a long and emphatic
digression, laced with quotations, on the productive accidents that can
occur during therapy sessions, on the 'existential aspect of therapy' and on
the 'paraclinical precision' of Shakespeare's poetry. Although I followed
his every word, the purpose of Dr Cox's digression quite escaped me.
I steered him back to the subject. Are some people too disturbed to benefit
from Shakespeare?
'It's a huge question. It depends on the perspective from which he or she
sees the world: that will fluctuate as it does for all of us. For example,
someone will see Hamlet stabbing Polonius and might easily say: 'that's
nothing to do with my life, that's simply an actor stabbing another actor.'
The person sitting beside might say: 'that stabbing is exactly like what I
did, except I stabbed a young man not an old man like Polonius.''
Does all this mean that once patients can distinguish between fantasy and
reality with the help of drama, they are cured and can be trusted to go out
into the world?
'No, it certainly doesn't. Drama is a generic human encounter. Patients have
to be treated as appropriate. There must be other signs of a more integrated
life, evident on the playing fields or in the workshop.
'Everything I say about the therapeutic aspects of drama must be seen not as
replacing, but supplementing, conventional clinical approaches, such as
psychotherapy, medication. That's very important.'
As he escorted me back to the gate of Broadmoor, and suspecting I had missed
something vital, I asked Dr. Cox to explain again the purpose of his
digression. I still didn't understand his reply.
But what I did understand, even as I felt the relief of crossing back into
the real world, was his fascination with the human mind - normal, poetic, or
deranged. Perhaps it is only by getting to grips with madness that we can
come to terms with the dreadful deeds of mankind. And that, after all, is
what Shakespeare was all about.
