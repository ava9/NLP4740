several results are far too close to call

Breakthroughs by Labour and the Liberal Democrats in London seem a real
possibility in today's local government elections.
In several boroughs, opponents to the Conservatives have abandoned the usual
pre-election cageyness and predict victories.
London politics remain more dominated by local issues than virtually any
other area of the UK, and several boroughs will not follow the national
swing.
According to Mr Tony Travers, head of the Greater London group at the London
School of Economics, there will be a series of two-party battles, with the
impact of the Liberal Democrats, who seem certain to improve on their 15 per
cent share of the vote in the last elections four years ago, making a number
of elections hard to call.
Conservative boroughs will attract the most attention. Statistically the
most 'winnable' for Labour are Hillingdon - already won by Labour in a
by-election - Enfield, Brent and Ealing.
But the Conservatives in Ealing say that the former Labour council's 65 per
cent rate rise in 1986 is still frequently volunteered on the doorsteps.
They are confident they will keep control.
In Tory-controlled Brent the contest will also be very close. Conservative
Central Office has repeatedly depicted Tory Brent as a highly efficient
council with a low poll tax, in much the same way that Wandsworth and
Westminster were portrayed in the 1990 campaign. Mr Leslie Winters, one of
the Tory campaign organisers, predicted a 6-seat Conservative majority, up
from the current three.
But Mr Paul Daisley, Brent's Labour leader, said his party is well ahead in
the 5 or 6 marginal wards that they need to win control.
In marginal Kingston the Liberal Democrats are the greatest threat, and Mr
John Tilley, the Liberal Democrat leader on the council, predicts his party
will have an overall majority of at least 2 seats.
'The big surprise was that the Tory vote turned out to be non-existent,' he
said.
Another band of seats in outer London boroughs will require a greater swing.
In Croydon Labour has fought hard to engineer a Tory defeat. Croydon is the
biggest London borough by population, Labour needs a handful of votes in the
right wards to win control from the Conservatives for the first time.
Neither party was confident of victory yesterday.
Mr Jeff Dixon, Labour's energetic campaign director, said: 'I'm cautious.
It's not easy to believe that 120 years of Tory rule in Croydon could now
come to an end.'
Sir Peter Bowness, the Tory leader, said the Tory vote was holding in the
right wards, but believed that the turnout would be decisive. 'It's vital we
get our people out,' he said. 'People must remember it's about who controls
this borough.'
In Harrow, the Liberal Democrats are the opposition and hope to pull off an
extraordinary coup. The Tories have a 10-seat majority, but Mr Ralph
Bancroft, Liberal Democrat campaign manager, believes his party could get
outright control if it wins seats in 3 crucial Tory wards, where there a
large number of 'don't knows'.
Mr Donald Abbot, the Tory leader, admits that the Liberals have an 'outside
chance' of taking control, but still claims his party has won through. His
campaign has emphatically distanced itself from government policy.
In Bexley, Labour believes it has a chance of outright victory. Mr Leonard
Newton, the Conservative leader, admitted that it had been difficult to
persuade voters to consider local rather than national issues and said: 'I'm
fairly confident that if we don't keep control then we'll still be the
largest party.'
Elsewhere, Waltham Forest, Lambeth and Southwark feature strenuous Liberal
Democrat campaigns against allegedly 'loony left' Labour councils. Gains of
seats, but not of overall councils, seem likely.
Tower Hamlets sees another battle between Labour and the Liberal Democrats,
complicated by the presence of the far-right British National Party, which
won its first ever by-election success in September.
Canvassers for the main parties admit there is still substantial BNP support
on the Isle of Dogs, scene of the by-election victory.
According to Mr Travers, defeats in a further six boroughs would be
impossible for the Conservatives to explain away - Bromley, Barnet,
Redbridge, Wandsworth, Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea.
Labour are carefully circumspect about their chances in Wandsworth and
Westminster - the 'flagships' of four years ago when the poll tax dominated
other issues.
The two boroughs still have the lowest council tax figures in London and
Labour campaigners seem pessimistic that this financial obstacle can be
overcome.
