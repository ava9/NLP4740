ADRIAN Noble has emerged at the best Shakespeare director of our time. His
King Lear at Stratford is every bit as good as the Hamlet that he introduced
at the Barbican last year. It is an even greater achievement because Lear is
a more difficult play. We should also remember his recent productions of
Henry IV and The Winter's Tale.
Noble works by seeing a Shakespeare play as a whole. He stands back and
looks at the entire environment. No character is too small not to be
developed, though without gimmicks; few lines are as irrelevant or obscure
enough to be cut. His Hamlet was as much a play about the court and society
as about Hamlet the man. Even in Lear we notice that there are long periods
when the king is off-stage. The action does not slow, nor the interest wane,
as a result.
The difficulty with King Lear is the absence of sympathy with the main
protagonists. It is not naturally a warm play. Noble has overcome that by
giving the title role to Robert Stephens, an actor whom he had already
brought back into the mainstream as Falstaff in Henry IV.
The gamble, if such it was, has paid off in gold. Stephens starts well and
gets steadily better as he goes on, like a man who knows how to conserve his
energy to the end, though not without electric flashes in between. At the
beginning he is in a long, smart, scarlet cloak, the colour worn by his
retainers. He is just as impressive in pyjamas and dressing gown in a
hospital bed in Act V. For this is a Lear who fears he is going mad, knows
he is going mad, does go mad and comes out serene. The transitions are most
marvellously paced.
Stephens has a distinctive voice with the ever-so-slight suspicion of a
lisp. He also has a beautiful smile, which he uses sometimes for the
audience, sometimes for the cast as though suggesting he can see through it
all. His presence is huge. At times, when peering at the audience, he makes
the Stratford stage seem small. The voice is used sparingly: often he seems
to be barely whispering, yet there is no chance of failing to hear him.
Lear's lines can seldom have been better spoken. Above all, he turns the
king into a sympathetic figure whom people can love, as Cordelia does.
Here is another Noble masterstroke. It is plain from the first scene when
Cordelia declines to go along with her father's division of the kingdom that
she is already regarded as a powerful personality at the court, way above
her sisters. The bond between Lear and Abigail McKern's Cordelia is thus
established at once. That is what holds the drama together.
Meanwhile there is the Fool, played with exquisite sensitivity by Ian
Hughes. Lear's affection for him is deep and vice-versa, though in the
latter case it is tinged with fear and foreboding. Again the symmetry of the
play emerges. The Fool is there when Cordelia is not.
Yet another mark of Noble's direction is the way he handles Simon Russell
Beale as Edgar. Normally Beale is a mannered actor whom some praise highly
while others demur. Here he is disciplined and without affectation, part of
the play, not the act itself. In short, he is absolutely right. Noble had
the same salutary effect on Kenneth Branagh in Hamlet.
One could scatter praise all round. Goneril and Regan, Janet Dale and Jenny
Quayle, would not expect much of it since Noble makes no excuses for their
behaviour. Nevertheless, they play the bitches that they are with great
competence. It is not their fault that this production is on the side of the
angels.
Look at David Calder's decent, loyal Kent, and the plain, blunt David
Bradely as Gloucester. They are both gems. Indeed the only character Noble
has trouble with is Albany, but the reason, I suspect, is that he is the
least satisfactory figure in the play: never properly developed.
The set, designed by Anthony Ward, is cosmic, as it should be: a largely
abstract backdrop with changing colours and images, and a huge suspended
globe, sometimes the moon, sometimes the earth looking as if Lear were
bearing it on his shoulders. To keep a sense of perspective, across the
floor is a map of Britain, subsequently torn up. Of course, the globe
cracks. No symbolism is missed, and none is overdone. This Lear and Robert
Stephens's Lear are magnificent.
