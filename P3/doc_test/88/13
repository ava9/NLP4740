Scotland Yard said last night it had been asked by Sir Nicholas Lyell,
attorney-general, 'to look at the allegation of incitement to racial hatred'
made against Liberal Democrats in Tower Hamlets.
The investigation will centre on whether a leaflet issued by the party in
the east London borough amounts to an incitement to racial hatred. Scotland
Yard said the instruction by Sir Nicholas had been made at the request of Mr
Jack Straw, chief Labour environment spokesman.
Earlier, the local Liberal Democrats faced a split over the issue after an
internal inquiry recommended the expulsion of three party members.
Mr Jeremy Shaw, one of three accused of circulating racist leaflets, said
local members were 'very likely' to set up a splinter group. A substantial
breakaway could deprive the Liberal Democrats of its eight-seat majority on
Tower Hamlets council, which the party won from Labour in 1986.
The internal inquiry, chaired by Lord Lester, a Liberal Democrat peer, was
set up after controversial leaflets were published during a council
by-election won by the far-right British National Party.
The report contains an indictment of campaigning tactics by Tower Hamlets
Liberal Democrats during the past three years. The tactics continued after
the inquiry was established.
The report also urges the national party to appoint a campaigns officer to
monitor Tower Hamlets until after local elections next May.
The three members, who deny racism, have the right to appeal to an
independent panel to be set up by the party. The report says the members
involved did not intend to stir up racial prejudice. But their populist
approach pandered to resentment and anxiety among local white voters.
The report's most damaging section asserts that the national Liberal
Democrat party knew what was happening in Tower Hamlets three years ago, but
took 'no effective concerted action'.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, tried quickly last night to
limit electoral damage to the party by making clear that it would act firmly
to end racism.
Mr Graham Tope, president of the Liberal Democrat London region, said the
exposure of racism in Tower Hamlets was unlikely to affect the party's
prospects in the elections.
He said: 'Where people comment at all, they recognise that this party has
not tried to sweep it under the carpet. Far from hurting us next May, I
think it is going to help us.' Mr Straw called the report 'a whitewash'.
