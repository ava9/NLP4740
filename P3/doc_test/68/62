Mongolia's premier on Thursday held inconclusive talks on live television with 
opposition leaders and hunger strikers demanding a multi-party system, 
diplomats in Ulan Bator said. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Dumaagiyn Sodnom met with 30 to 40 representatives from five unofficial 
political groups, including several hunger strikers, but the televised debate 
broke off after 90 minutes, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the hunger strikers are continuing their protest. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 members of Mongolia's infant opposition groups started the hunger 
strike Wednesday after the government failed to respond to their demands for 
reforms that were outlined in a petition delivered Sunday, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The petition, signed by the Mongolian Democratic Union and three other 
unofficial political groups, calls for the Communist Party to give up its 
monopoly on power and hold new parliamentary elections.
