</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parliament today overwhelmingly approved constitutional amendments that are to 
transform communist Hungary into a multi-party democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 94 changes passed by the 380-member Parliament were amendments 
eliminating all references to the leading role of the newly dissolved Communist 
Party. Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar said they effectively end one-party rule 
in the East Bloc nation. 
</P>
<P>
The country's formal name also was changed from People's Republic of Hungary to 
Republic of Hungary to reflect a break with the communist past. 
</P>
<P>
Another change in the 1949 Constitution abolishes the 21-person collective 
presidency and replaces it with the office of the president.
