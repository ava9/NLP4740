Most participants in an almost two-month hunger strike at the Baja California 
state penitentiary in Tijuana have suspended their protest and begun to eat 
after Mexican authorities vowed to investigate their allegations of torture and 
other improprieties by Mexican federal police. 
</P>
<P>
The 30 inmates who have agreed to suspend their strike contend that they were 
wrongly jailed by federal authorities, mostly on drug charges -- a common 
allegation in Mexico. Nationwide, there have been widespread allegations that 
federal police have resorted to torture, murder and other unlawful means in an 
effort to make arrests and demonstrate Mexico's commitment to combating 
narcotics trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the federal prisoners participating in the strike contend that they 
were beaten into signing false confessions, purportedly spelling out their 
involvement in international drug trafficking networks. 
</P>
<P>
A separate group of about 15 Tijuana prisoners seeking early parole after being 
convicted for a variety of crimes is continuing the hunger strike this week, 
although prison officials said that some or all are expected to be released 
within days. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 70 prisoners were participating in the strike at one point, although 
the total number had declined to 45 last weekend, strikers said. Most have 
refused food for seven weeks, strikers say, but some joined in later and have 
participated for shorter durations. There are about 2,500 inmates at the 
prison, which was built for 600 prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
The strikers, who based their protest in and around a two-story gazebo amid the 
crowded grounds of the prison complex, say they have only been taking liquids, 
including honey. A number have been treated at the prison clinic and one 
ex-striker is in grave condition at a Tijuana hospital, with internal wounds 
allegedly inflicted in a police beating. 
</P>
<P>
Among those expressing support for the strikers' cause have been several 
prominent human rights activists and Tijuana Mayor Carlos Montejo Favela, who 
even staged a symbolic hunger strike aimed at demonstrating his sympathy for 
the prisoners' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials have denied any abuse by federal police, contending that 
inmates who say they were wrongly accused have the option of submitting 
evidence of abuse to judges. The inmates contend that Mexican federal judges 
are as corrupt as the federal police and are disinclined to listen to tales of 
official wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to suspend the strike and resume eating was made this past 
weekend, after a government human rights official vowed that officials would 
review the 30 disputed cases, said Valentin Tapia Aguilar, the leader of the 
strikers. The human rights official, who met with the strikers at the 
penitentiary, is a member of a national commission set up earlier this year by 
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who created the body in response 
to complaints of abuse by federal police. 
</P>
<P>
The strikers agreed to give government officials until next Tuesday to complete 
their inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
The strikers also have asked for a broader review of the cases of 763 
non-striking inmates, most of whom were charged with drug trafficking, Tapia 
said. They have expressed the hope that their strike could become a national 
movement, leading to vast reforms of the Mexican criminal justice system.
