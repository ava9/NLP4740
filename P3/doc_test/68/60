<TEXT>
<P>
Nationalism, ethnic identity and religion played crucial roles in shattering 
the communist domination of Eastern Europe. As the extraordinary forces of an 
extraordinary 1989, they were more powerful than the Moscow brand of 
Marxism-Leninism imposed four decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
Identical forces rise in non-Russian republics of the Soviet Union and they 
erupt in communist Yugoslavia. The process seems to portend the end of a 
historical cycle begun with Russia's 1917 Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Yet nationalism, ethnicity and religion may also create problems no less 
profound in post-communist Eastern Europe -- antagonisms between countries and 
within them. Positive forces can become negative forces, undermining the effort 
to build democracies, reconstruct economies and assure reasonable social 
harmony. 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult problems could involve relationships between Poland and the 
German Democratic Republic -- East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In the immediate aftermath of World War II, Stalin annexed Poland's easternmost 
territories, roughly one-third of the country, while awarding to Poland 
Germany's eastern provinces up to the Oder and Neisse rivers. Millions of 
Germans were expelled in the process, losing homes and businesses, and being 
forced to flee to East or West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Long before the fall of communist regimes in Poland and East Germany this year, 
serious frictions had developed between the two governments despite mutual 
memberships in the Warsaw Pact and Comecon, the communist common market. Polish 
and East German warships fired at each other off the Baltic coast over fishing 
rights; East German organizations kept alive anti-Polish revanchism. 
</P>
<P>
A territorial issue exploded only last month, with the collapse of the East 
German communist regime. The sudden possibility of German reunification 
reopened old sores on both sides of the Oder-Neisse border. Ethnic Germans who 
had stayed behind on the Polish side began organizing what Warsaw regarded as 
anti-Polish associations. The East German regime forbade Polish citizens to 
shop for goods on the German side of the frontier. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Warsaw's Gazeta Wyborcza, the new democratic newspaper with 
the largest circulation in Poland, charged that "explosions of anti-Polish 
phobia" among Germans were threatening the democratic order in Europe. The 
front-page editorial appeared just as the Polish government headed by Prime 
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a Solidarity leader, made clear that Poland would 
accept German reunification only after all Germans, East and West, formally 
recognized the Oder-Neisse line (as the Western Allies had done long ago). 
</P>
<P>
Finally, West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher felt the need to 
announce that "it is completely clear that Germans do not question the Polish 
western border -- now or in the future." But the issue remains. Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl made no such assurances to the Poles in his 10-point program for 
German unification and Genscher's comment may have no impact on German public 
opinion, East or West. 
</P>
<P>
The peril is not a new Balkanizing of sovereignties or frontiers but the threat 
of confrontations among former Soviet satellites and internal chaos. Throwbacks 
to oppression, if not neo-Fascism and anti-Semitism, could result. 
</P>
<P>
Nationalistic or ethnic resentments were papered over during the decades of 
Soviet control, to present an image of communist unity to the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
Problems in Czechoslovakia also date back to the 1940s. At the end of World War 
II, more than 2 million ethnic Germans were expelled from Czech lands by the 
Soviets. Those people are now agitating in Germany for what they regard as 
their right to return and regain their properties. 
</P>
<P>
In Poland and Czechoslovakia, domestic public opinion angrily opposes such 
agitation, emphasizing that the Germans appear to forget that the existing 
state of affairs was a response to Hitler's war and Nazi occupation. 
</P>
<P>
To protect themselves from German demands, the Poles insist on a clear 
understanding with both Germanys on the inviolability of present borders 
"before it is too late," as the Solidarity newspaper put it the other day. 
</P>
<P>
Territorial problems also exist between Hungary, now moving toward 
parliamentary democracy, and Romania, still under a Stalin-style dictatorship, 
over Transylvania. Stalin had given almost half of the long-disputed 
Transylvanian territory to Romania as a reward, because her armies joined the 
Soviets in the closing days of the war after abandoning the Wehrmacht. Hungary 
did not switch sides. Now Budapest complains that ethnic Hungarians are 
ill-treated in Romanian Transylvania -- and thousands try to flee. 
</P>
<P>
Then come the internal problems, no less divisive, already developing in the 
nations barely out of communist control. In both Poland and Hungary, groups 
that until recently formed anti-communist opposition movements are now in 
power, especially in Warsaw where Mazowiecki is Eastern Europe's first 
post-communist prime minister. Yet deep rivalries are already emerging within 
those groups. 
</P>
<P>
New Polish and Hungarian political organizations are spawning right-wing 
factions that seem to be gaining strength. Renascent anti-Semitism is too often 
their common denominator, although Poland's prewar Jewish population of 3 
million has shrunk to about 12,000 as a result of the Holocaust. Hungary's Jews 
number fewer than 85,000. In both countries, however, many key figures in the 
democratic leadership are of Jewish origin -- as is East Germany's latest 
Communist Party boss, Gregor Gysi -- and the ancient prejudices boil to the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
In West Germany last week, the ultra-right Republican Party, headed by a former 
SS officer, announced plans to form a "sister" party in East Germany. In the 
Soviet Union, more than 70,000 Jews departed this year, a record exodus partly 
stimulated by relaxed emigration rules but also partly impelled by fear of 
nationalism and anti-Semitism within Russian, Ukrainian and Muslim republics. 
</P>
<P>
Old tensions in Czechoslovakia, between Czechs and Slovaks, reappear. During 
the war, a Nazi puppet state was created in Slovakia, headed by Slovaks. Gustav 
Husak, who resigned last week as Czechoslovakia's hard-line president, is a 
Slovak. As the new national leadership takes shape in Prague, one of the major 
issues will be balancing Czech and Slovak sensitivities to prevent a rekindling 
of inter-ethnic hatreds. 
</P>
<P>
In Yugoslavia, still a communist state, the national unity enforced by Marshal 
Tito is crumbling. Since Tito's death in 1980, ethnic and economic differences 
among the six republics and two autonomous regions that make up the Yugoslav 
federation have brought the nation to the brink of conflict and collapse. 
Serbia, the largest republic, is battling the more affluent republics of 
Croatia and Slovenia for political primacy. Croats and ethnic Albanians in the 
southeast have had physical confrontations. The economy is in shambles. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the new decade, at the threshold of a free political and economic 
order, Europe's infant democracies face severe growing pains.
