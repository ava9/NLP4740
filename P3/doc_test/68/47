  [Text] Tirana -- The hunger strike in Kukes, an event 
whose drama shocked the entire country at the end of last week, 
has ended. After a meeting with a delegation of the strikers 
lasting many hours, the government has promised to meet most of 
the demands so strongly put forward by many inhabitants of the 
villages of Kukes. 
  Finally, after many days of bargaining, the government's 
representatives and the strikers whose land had been inundated 
succeeded in finding a common language. This was confirmed to 
journalists on 12 May by the chairman of the strikers' 
delegation, chosen unanimously the day before at the joint 
meeting of the strikers holed up in the local government 
building and the Lake of Fierze Association of the Flooded Out. 
"We are now sort of satisfied," the strike chairman said as he 
emerged from his meeting with Prime Minister Meksi, "because 
our main demands were met." He also expressed confidence that 
the government's latest promises would also lead others to give 
up their hunger strike. 
  The government has agreed to quickly implement various 
measures designed to ease the burden of poverty under which 
these areas labor. The peasants of Kukes have first been 
promised compensation with land or in cash for their land 
inundated by the Lake of Fierze. These people will also benefit 
from long-term loans for house-building and preferential loans 
for the development of private agriculture. For those 
inhabitants who even after these measures will still find it 
difficult to live on their small areas of infertile land, the 
government has undertaken to organize emigration to more 
prosperous areas of the country where there is still free state 
land. Specialists will review once again social welfare for the 
inhabitants of Kukes. One of the measures promised by the 
government has been an increase in the level of social support 
for these people. Kukes will also be given preference in the 
distribution of humanitarian aid and other forms of assistance. 
  The government's representatives failed to agree to only two 
of the demands included in the strike program: co-ownership of 
the Fierze hydroelectric station and the payment of rent for the 
inundated land.
