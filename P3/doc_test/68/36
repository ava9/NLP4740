<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman </F>
Gyula Horn by Szendrei in Miskolc on 11 May: "The Country Has 
To Be Put In Order"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Szendrei] Would you now 
have the courage to predict the final results for the Hungarian 
Socialist Party [MSZP] at the elections? 
  [Horn] Naturally, it is difficult to enter into such 
predictions. I would very much like our individual candidates 
to gain as many mandates as possible. There is a chance for the 
majority to win the elections. It is no accident that they had 
such good results in the first round. I continue to have faith 
in the sober judgment of the voters. 
  [Szendrei] Do you think it possible for the MSZP to gain an 
absolute majority in parliament? 
  [Horn] I think this is also possible. The MSZP was the 
party that offered the real political change, therefore, it is 
not out of the question for us to reach more than 66 percent. 
  [Szendrei] Does this mean that Hungary might end up with a 
one-party government? 
  [Horn] I continue to hope for the government to have as many 
political forces as possible, or for it to have their support. 
This would be good for the country and for handling the very 
serious heritage we are facing. We will have to begin putting 
this in order immediately after the round on 29 May. The 
country has to be put in order. It cannot carry on the way it 
is. 
  [Szendrei] I will ask again: Will your party be willing to 
govern on its own? 
  [Horn] If the voters wish, and if our support is so big that 
we can undertake this on our own, then we will. We have never 
yet run away from any tasks. 
  [Szendrei] After the first round, have you discussed a 
possible coalition with the Free Democrat leaders? 
  [Horn] No. I know that, after my accident, the Free 
Democrat leaders immediately spoke to [Deputy Chairman] Imre 
Szekeres and wished me a speedy recovery through him, but 
political talks did not take place between the two parties at 
all. [passage omitted] 
  [Szendrei] In the interview you gave to the Television's 
News program, you categorically refuted that you might be 
supporting Gabor Kuncze [prime ministerial candidate of the 
Alliance of Free Democrats] as prime ministerial candidate. 
Does this mean that you will apply for the prime ministerial 
position? 
  [Horn] As it has already been announced, the MSZP will hold 
an extraordinary congress and the party's prime ministerial 
candidate will be selected there. 
  [Szendrei] How will the MSZP begin to govern? 
  [Horn] First of all, it is most important to get a realistic 
view of the country's situation. We have only partial 
information on the past four years, we do not have a full view 
of the situation. I am afraid that, when it comes to defining 
the practical tasks of governing, we will find far graver 
details than those we are aware of at present. [passage omitted]
