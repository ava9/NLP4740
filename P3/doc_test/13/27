The Baltimore Orioles wear black stirrups instead of orange . . . and win a 
game. Slugger Mickey Tettleton puts on a Dick Tracy T-shirt . . . and breaks 
out of a slump. Relief pitchers pose Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle figures, hop 
over white foul lines or sing on the mound . . . and save games. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidence? You decide. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball players have long been a superstitious lot. And who are the Orioles to 
mess with tradition, especially when they're having an on-again, off-again 
season like this year? 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone believes in their own way," Tettleton says with a smile that 
barely cracks a jaw as square as Dick Tracy's own. 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton gave an inadvertent boost to the big upcoming flick by letting on 
that he was wearing a Dick Tracy T-shirt under his uniform when he recently 
emerged from a frustrating slump at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"I got it in the mail, I don't even know where it came from," he demurs. 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton probably isn't the most superstitious Oriole -- despite his current 
streak, he hasn't even decided whether to keep wearing the T-shirt. But he's 
the most highly publicized one when the subject comes up. During a hot streak 
last year, for example, it was Froot Loops: His wife revealed that the cereal 
was the breakfast of this particular champion, and a legend was born. 
</P>
<P>
"You play so many games," the catcher says with a shrug, "more than anything, 
this sort of thing breaks the routine." 
</P>
<P>
Athletes, and baseball players in particular, can be more prone to 
superstitions than the rest of us, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"There is such an element of chance in baseball, it makes it vulnerable to 
magical thinking," says Jim McGee, the Orioles' former team psychologist. "And 
there may be the sense that baseball, compared to other sports, is 
extraordinarily traditional. They still do things in 1990 that they did in 
1890." 
</P>
<P>
And who's to argue with someone like Joe Orsulak? His team-leading batting 
average -- for the third straight year -- lends credibility to his particular 
superstition. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like pitchers touching my bat. It's bad luck," says the outfielder. "I 
won't use it if a pitcher's touched it." 
</P>
<P>
Orsulak also has used a sort of personal voodoo to psyche out a pitcher who has 
caused him difficulty in the past: He wore a T-shirt with the pitcher's name 
and face on it the next time he had to face him. 
</P>
<P>
"I got hits off him," he reports. 
</P>
<P>
But certainly the most superstitious player award on the team goes to Brian 
Holton. Hey kids, you, too, can be a major league relief pitcher! Clip and 
save: 
</P>
<P>
"I get dressed the same way every day. Then I button just three buttons of my 
warm-up jacket. I go and get a towel and wrap it around my neck, and the tag 
always has to be on the right side," Holton says. "I put two cans of Copenhagen 
(smokeless tobacco product) in my pocket, one from spring training and a new 
one. In my left pocket I carry a lasso. ... I found a piece of rope in San 
Diego once (in 1988) and made a lasso out of it and we went on a winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
"I always sit in the same seat in the bullpen and in the dugout," he continues. 
"I come up on the mound from the first base side. I wipe the (pitching) rubber 
four times with each leg and spin around clockwise. I catch the ball with one 
foot on the dirt and one foot on the grass. I never change catchers. If he's 
not ready (after batting in the last inning), I wait for him, I don't throw to 
anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"I always sing on the mound to myself, whatever they're playing," Holton adds. 
"If they're not playing anything, I'll sing, 'You take the high road, I'll take 
the low road."' 
</P>
<P>
Holton says he started this routine as a 10-year-old (hmmm, perhaps not the 
part about the tobacco) and sees it more as a way to relax himself rather than 
to soothe the gods. 
</P>
<P>
Relief pitchers, said McGee, who was team psychologist from 1980 to 1986, may 
need such rituals more than other players because of the unique nature of their 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
"Their tension level is always high, they can't tell when they're going in," he 
says. "If they don't perform their rituals, they feel anxious." 
</P>
<P>
McGee likens ritualistic superstitions to a behavior observed in animals. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a naturally occurring form of superstitious behavior in animals. Take 
a little dog who every time he hears a big noisy truck runs to the same part of 
the back yard and starts to dig madly," McGee says. "The dog isn't digging 
because it thinks the truck will go away if it digs a hole. It's digging to 
avoid anxiety." 
</P>
<P>
McGee says superstitions have such a hold on us because, every once in a while, 
they "work." Actually, a lot of times they don't work, but you remember the 
payoffs rather than all the other times, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer you go without a payoff, the more you think it must be right around 
the corner," McGee said. "So, ironically, the longer you go without the 
superstition being reinforced, the more powerful the superstition becomes." 
</P>
<P>
Either that, or you try a new one. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been switching batting gloves, wrist bands, changing bats. Nothing's 
really working," first baseman Randy Milligan says with a laugh. "I just keep 
doing things till it clicks." 
</P>
<P>
Some baseball superstitions, though, are immutable -- don't jinx a no-hitter by 
saying one's in progress. And watch the lines! 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing I don't do is step on the white lines," says relief pitcher Mark 
Williamson of this commonly held superstition. "I just never have." 
</P>
<P>
And other superstitions are quite idiosyncratic -- probably no one in the 
majors besides Rene Gonzales tucks his glove in a Wonder Bread bag. 
</P>
<P>
"That goes back a long way, to my first year of college when a coach called me 
'Wonder Bread' because my defense had no holes. That was when there was that 
ad, 'Wonder Bread, it has no holes,"' the infielder says. 
</P>
<P>
There are some legendarily superstitious baseball players elsewhere -- the 
Boston Red Sox's Wade Boggs, for example, has a host of superstitions ranging 
from eating chicken to running sprints to, yes, road-trip girlfriend Margo 
Adams' underwear or lack thereof. 
</P>
<P>
Which could be why Brady Anderson, the Oriole outfielder who came up through 
the Red Sox farm system, has his unique superstition. 
</P>
<P>
"My superstition is not to have any superstitions," Anderson says. "I don't 
want to get any started."
