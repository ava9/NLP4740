Rest easy, folks. Whatever you might have supposed, baseball is the same as it 
ever was. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, at Bobby Maduro Miami Stadium, that's a mixed blessing. The crack of 
the bat was muffled by the roar of planes flying overhead, and the elevator was 
in mid-season form, briefly trapping one unfortunate. There was a fire sighted 
somewhere in the distance, a dark cloud befouling the blue skies, and it seemed 
just like home. 
</P>
<P>
Only 1,959 hardy souls braved the 80-degree temperatures (it was slightly 
overcast) for the Baltimore Orioles' spring opener. The small crowd was almost 
certainly less a statement on the recent labor strife than it was one more 
reason why the Orioles would rather be playing their spring games elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to begin, the Orioles played two Monday, starting with a "B" game, 
featuring mostly minor leaguers. In the fourth inning of the first game, 
Orioles Manager Frank Robinson leaned over from the dugout to pronounce his 
team "unbeaten and unbeatable." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, they lost both games, by identical 5-3 scores. Not that it 
mattered. Spring games are public rehearsals that don't merit serious review. 
The idea is to learn your lines. 
</P>
<P>
For Phil Bradley, it is the 10th such rehearsal, but this one differs 
significantly from the others. He prepared himself for the 1990 baseball season 
by sitting through labor negotiations in the face of a lockout, arguing the 
players' cause, helping to sort out an agreement that took longer than anyone 
should have guessed. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me to be patient," Bradley was saying Monday, "but I didn't 
understand what they meant. Now I do." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the same kind of patience demanded of a batter facing a breaking-ball 
pitcher. Lawyers understand this kind of patience, wherein delay is a weapon 
and obfuscation is the name of the game. If you ask Bradley what he did in his 
off-season, he'll tell you he learned a whole new ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
First, he volunteered to be elected to serve on the executive board of the 
players' association, knowing full well that it meant he'd have to become a 
labor negotiator, for good and ill. He said that the choice wasn't as difficult 
as it might seem. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to know what's going on," he said. "The only way you could know was to 
be a part of it. From early December, I was involved in almost every 
negotiation that took place. I was in L.A. and I was in Tampa. I must have made 
eight or 10 trips to New York. 
</P>
<P>
"The frustrating part was that so many of the issues seemed so direct, but they 
were never dealt with directly. Eventually, I figured out this thing wasn't 
going to end until the owners wanted it to end, no matter what I did. When I 
understood that, it took a lot of pressure off me. They were the ones who were 
going to decide when we were going to get things resolved." 
</P>
<P>
And so, Bradley was involved, up to his numbers. He's that kind of person 
anyway, one who takes life a little more seriously than the rest of us do. If 
you were a member of a union, he's just the person you'd want negotiating on 
your side. 
</P>
<P>
For a ballplayer, though, there is a downside to that degree of involvement. 
</P>
<P>
For today's player, at least for those players who don't have to drive a truck 
to support themselves, the off-season is a time to prepare for the on-season. 
Players take better care of themselves than they used to in the supposed good 
old days, when the only wintertime conditioning in which your average player 
partook was to pay someone to shovel the snow off the walk. Today, a player 
comes to camp in shape. He has stretched out his arm and probably taken some 
swings in a batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until March, I was working out three times a week," Bradley said. "After 
that, I didn't get as much work in. Am I behind? I don't know. I feel good. I 
know I haven't had a good start since 1985, no matter what I've done over the 
winter. I told myself when I got involved in this that I wasn't going to blame 
a slow start on the negotiations. If I did that, how was I going to explain the 
other years?" 
</P>
<P>
Last year was not everything Bradley wanted it to be. Although it was the first 
year in six big-league seasons he had played on a team to have won more than 
half its games, he hit only .277 -- 16 points below his lifetime average. A big 
second-half hitter for all his career, Bradley slumped after the All-Star 
break, and he may have been pressing during his first pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
For this season, he has changed the number of his uniform from 16 to 1, and 
maybe that will help. But he wouldn't change anything about his role as a labor 
negotiator, except its duration. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want me to do it again the next time, I'd be happy to do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, there was baseball to be played. Bradley, batting leadoff in 
Monday's spring opener, had a single and a walk and reached base on an error in 
three trips to the plate. It didn't seem so bad, and the best part was nobody 
tried to talk him out of it.
