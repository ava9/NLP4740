frustration over missed opportunities at Lyons

LAST weekend the doors of the new Lyons opera house opened at last. Bright
splashes of ceremony marked the end of the six long years France's second
city has had to endure without one. There were speeches by the mayor and the
new Culture Minister. There were two new opera productions, both conducted
by the company chief, Kent Nagano: the long-awaited premiere of a Debussy
reconstruction and a High-Concept new version of The Tales of Hoffmann. On
both evenings in the magnificent Hotel de Ville across the square there were
post-performance canapes and champagne for notables, local dignitaries and
the specially-invited French and international press.
And in between there were opportunities to examine from many angles the
realisation of Jean Nouvel's bold design for a state-of-the-art
opera-theatre built up out of the old Lyons opera house. Tres controversee,
the mayor called it. That is, I think, putting it mildly. On the evidence of
these first encounters I shall risk describing the new theatre as at once a
brilliantly-imagined art-object in itself and, in practical terms, a pretty
considerable disaster.
The architect, prevented by on-site limitations of space from enlarging the
old theatre, pursued instead the idea of expanding upwards within its frame.
The original facade and grand foyer have been preserved; the rest was boldly
germinated to provide sharp distinctions of new-versus-old visual contrast.
A great half-tunnel roof crowns the edifice; within it a new theatre (1,300
seats, 500 more than in the old) is supported by an elaborate suspension
system (the technology of the building is a source of great fascination),
and above the auditorium itself there is provision for much-needed
administrative and rehearsal space.
The marriage of past and present, of glass panes, metal girders and
warm-toned classical columns, is distinctive. Viewed from the surrounding
square late at night the whole complex leaves an impression of glamour and
confidence of style and purpose. But a theatre is for rather more than
street-level gazing. It is for audiences and performers, and for effecting
with maximum efficiency and ease the artistic link between them. Nouvel
seems not to have understood these most basic of requirements.
The entrance foyer and main passageways are painted in Stygian shiny black,
as is the theatre auditorium itself. The antechambers are in screaming red,
with lighting to match. A single pair of escalators is all there is to lift
1,300 people from entrance to theatre level (the pre-performance crush on
both opening evenings was simply frightful); and the connecting stairways
are made of bouncing thin perforated metal rather like a lemon zester - just
the thing for filtering footwear dirt and dust onto the heads of people
below.
The sense of rat-in-a-psychologist's-cage unease induced by the blanketing
colours of death and emergency is completed by arrival in one's narrow seat,
with its insufficient leg room and cold metal arm-rests. The reasoning
behind the black-and-red ordinance was that this would force total
concentration on the stage; what it induces instead - in my case at least -
are feelings of claustrophobia and irrational loathing of all architects.
Before the Saturday Hoffmann there were cries from the upper tiers of 'Go
ahead, we can't see anything anyway]', which raised again the already vexed
topic of upper-level sightlines; and a Deep Throat from the chorus told me
of physically nightmarish conditions backstage.
The new theatre has cost under FFrs 480m - peanuts compared with the sums
lavished on the Bastille. It scores over the Paris theatre in one crucial
respect - its well-balanced acoustics. For the rest, and with the Paris
mistakes in mind, one wanted to howl with frustration at the waste all over
again of time, effort and precious resources. When the building's various
ills finally prove intolerable, as they soon must, one can only hope that
action both swift and clear-minded will be taken to heal them.
Given all this, and the various necessary feats of co-ordination required to
put on two operas and a new Coppelia in a brand-new opera house, it was to
Nagano's great credit that musically the two opera productions were of a
standard to make the Lyons visit worthwhile malgre tout. Rodrigue et Chimene
is the Grand Opera, on a flatulently verbose libretto by the playwright
Catulle Mendes distantly related to Corneille's Le Cid, that Debussy began
(in 1888) but never completed. It has been pieced together from various
piano-score sources by the Debussy scholar Richard Langham Smith, with
textual help from Georges Beck; Lyons commissioned the Russian composer
Edison Denisov to score the three substantial acts thus created.
The result is not a complete opera (Langham Smith looks forward to the day
when a putative fourth act materialises) nor even a 'real' opera (pace,
timing and narrative sequence are clumsy). But musically it is two hours of
continuous richness, a pre-Pelleas web woven out of the influences of
Parsifal, Mussorgsky and Massenet, as well as the language of Debussy's own
early songs and Blessed Damozel cantata. It affords a profound new insight
into the composer at a crucial turning-point in his artistic development.
Hearing it as played by the excellent Opera de Lyon orchestra under Nagano's
lucid baton, and sung by a strong cast (Laurence Dale and Donna Brown in the
title roles, Jean-Philippe Courtis and Jules Bastin as their warring
fathers) and the no less strong Lyons chorus, was a pleasure. Seeing it in a
grey-toned, stiff-gaited production by Georges Lavaudant was rather less so
 -this was hardly the spirit-lifting piece of work needed to relieve the
gloom of the theatre.
But totally, horribly faithful to the worst aspects of the architectural
enterprise was the unbroken two-hour version of Hoffmann the following
evening. Comparable with the theatre, this was Opera as Art-Object: cut-down
Offenbach devised by the Lyons dramaturge Michel Vittoz, produced by the
company boss, Louis Erlo, and re-titled . . . Des Contes d'Hoffmann (note
the dots and the 'des').
A more frustrating exercise in 'structuralist' intellectual posturing of the
French persuasion would be hard to imagine. The setting was that weariest of
modern-opera cliches, the mad-house. Olympia was a crippled inmate released
from her wheelchair and callipers during the Doll Song, a gruesome scene.
Drawing high-fashion operatic frisson from presentations of madness and
physical handicap is a base pursuit. A lesser cause of dismay was the waste
of Nagano, the orchestra and a classy cast: the sympathetic young tenor
Daniel Galvez-Vallejo (Hoffmann), Barbara Hendricks (Antonia), Nathalie
Dessay (Olympia), Brigitte Balleys (Nicklaus) and the great Jose van Dam as
nemesis-figure.
