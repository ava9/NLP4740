The amount of opera available in Paris this season is astonishing. In terms
of quantity, at least, the city is currently the world's most varied
operatic emporium. Rarities and novelties of all kinds find outlets at the
Chatelet, pro the Champs-Elysees and the Opera-Comique. At the new Bastille
theatre, in its first full season, a groundplan of repertory works is being
fulfilled. After Otello, Figaro, Berio's Un re in ascolto, and Queen of
Spades comes the Puccini Manon Lescaut; Samson et Dalila, Flute and Katya
Kabanova follow shortly. The list is an intelligent piece of
bread-and-butter planning; the early Puccini opera, a copious lyrical
outpouring of youthful passions, is just the sort of work to set a large
theatre Italianately ringing the way opera audiences love it to do.
At a Manon Lescaut performance in the middle of the run, a uniquely
depressing and alarming experience, that seemed the foremost problem: the
theatre doesn't allow ringing. The acoustics have been the source of
controversy since it was opened, but there can surely be no disagreement
over the wrong-end-of-the-telescope reductive impact they are forcing on
Puccini's vocal lines. Placed anywhere but at the very front of that
incommodiously broad, deep stage, the singers are audible  - but as if their
voices were coming in on the breeze from the next quartier.
As in this unevenly shaped, narratively zigzagging opera it is in the vocal
outbursts, solo or duet, that dramatic impetus is most strongly sustained,
it is impossible to exaggerate the cumulatively disastrous effect of the
acoustics on the voices and on the opera. Puccini distanced, Puccini
prevented from hitting a listener smack in the solar plexus, is Puccini
denatured; the orchestral sound is clear, if not exactly ripe in bloom, but
from pit and stage no sort of musical blend or even balance seems possible.
As if in covert admission of all the theatre's self-generated handicaps, the
production by Robert Carsen seeks to plump out the stage with huge, glitzy
spectacle. The stage is at almost all times chock-full of supers - Mardi
Gras revellers wearing gaudy capes and carrying huge umbrellas, perruqued
and white-powdered courtiers at the stage margins, Act 2 servants in endless
formations. The designs (by Anthony Ward) suggest touches of theatrical
avant-garderie (with mirrors, huge falling drapes, skewed walls) without
making the audience nervous; the tricks of novelty in the staging do
likewise.
It's the latest form of what Brecht deemed 'culinary' entertainment. Since
the production bears surtitles in French and English, and is shared with
Antwerp, it's also, I would say, International Opera in its most worrying
incarnation: opera that looks good, means nothing, can be taken from house
to house, and is capable of supporting a procession of unrehearsed singers
without much damage. For the Manon Lescaut run the house had planned
alternate casts, but on this occasion there were substitutes - unexplained -
for those alternates: the conductor Nello Santi was replaced by Maurizio
Barbacini, the tenor Vasile Moldoveanu by Antonio Ordonez.
In the circumstances, it was something of a miracle that things held
together as well as they did (Mr Barbacini is obviously a conductor worth
trying out in better-ordered conditions); one saluted the professionalism of
Patrick Raftery (Lescaut), and the trenchant delivery of Ian Caley (Edmondo)
and Jules Bastin (Geronte): no holding their voices back] I had been looking
forward to a first hearing of Ordonez, a Spanish tenor who burst on the
European scene a few years ago; the timbre is plangently appealing, but the
loud high phrases are all in overdrive, and on this occasion he simply ran
out of them in Act 3.
The heroine was Barbara Daniels. She is what the Italians call a vero
artista: a performer who communicates warmth and engagement, a sense of the
words, a feeling for the musical style. In these disconnected circumstances
her Manon came across in eye- and ear-catching bursts, not all of a piece;
but at least she came across. It is time for those in charge at the Bastille
to stop pussyfooting about. The scale of the acoustical problems is immense,
and no earthly purpose is served by the continuing denial of their
existence.
