MALLE DISSECTS FRENCH FAMILY LIFE IN 'MURMUR OF THE HEART'

Young Laurent Chevalier, hero of Louis Malle's sunnily sensual reissued "Murmur 
of the Heart" (opening Friday at the Music Hall) has a wide, droll mouth that 
curls up at the ends like a Picasso line drawing and ears almost like a faun's. 
Something about that look, combined with his skinny skittishness, lets us 
tolerate 14-year-old Laurent even when he behaves like a consummate brat; when, 
for example, in an agony of jealousy he deliberately drops a bottle of milk for 
their aging family maid to clean up. 
</P>
<P>
Also, it's 1954. Horrific manners are the mark of the lordly young Frenchman, 
these three particularly; sons of a well-off Dijon gynecologist and his 
free-spirited Italian wife. Their world would change soon enough; it is already 
changing: the French are losing at Dien Bien Phu; in a little more than a 
decade, kids this age from the bourgeoisie would became radicalized. 
</P>
<P>
Writer-director Malle, who wrote the film in one firestorm week in the spring 
of 1970 and finished it the following year, conjures up that family, that time, 
that insular smugness with a notable mixture of affection and observation. It's 
his family, something we recognize even more clearly after "Au Revoir Les 
Enfants." 
</P>
<P>
Malle, too, had the two older brothers, the love for Charlie Parker and Jelly 
Roll Morton, the heart murmur and the summer at the spa that his young Laurent 
shares. Even the hilarious game of spinach tennis is from memory. But the 
funny, earthy, faintly unhappy Italian mother, Clara, a wild bird untamed by 
her 20 years stifled in the bosom of the French bourgeoisie, is Malle's 
creation. 
</P>
<P>
She has been given indelible life by Lea Massari, an apricot-colored goddess 
whose charm lies in her exuberance, her physicality, her very un-Frenchness, 
and in an utterly disarming sprinkling of freckles. Clara, the daughter of a 
radical political exile, was a 16-year-old visitor to France when Charles 
Chevalier (Daniel Gelin) became her first lover and then her husband, to the 
consternation of his moneyed parents. 
</P>
<P>
Of their three sons, Laurent (Benoit Ferreux), the youngest, is her favorite. 
She adores and babies him; (somehow) he sees her spirit for what it is. His 
older brothers, Marc (Marc Winocourt) and Thomas (Fabien Ferreux, Benoit's own 
brother) have fallen into the habit of putting her down, telling her that she 
couldn't even pass their exams. 
</P>
<P>
When scarlet fever leaves Laurent with a heart murmur, Clara goes with him to a 
health spa up in the mountains. The two are like one closed fist against the 
young prigs and Royalists Laurent encounters, these children of the stuffy, 
social French families who populate the spa. Clara, by being herself -- playing 
her first game of tennis in sneakers and street clothes -- seems marvelous to 
these 16- and 17-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
It's at the spa, triggered by an evening of Bastille Day celebration, that the 
scene that made the film a cause celebre occurs. It's a subdued, nuzzling 
moment between boy-child and intensely affectionate mother, when all his 
impacted jealousy, fascination, adoration and curiousity carry Laurent across 
the line into incest. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen years ago, some of us were so busy priding ourselves on being 
shockproof that we didn't really think to question Malle further: to wonder at 
how firmly he denied the moment its reverberations -- to both parties. If this 
was incest, tasteful, "open," utterly without consequence, then what was all 
the fuss about? Actually, what today's audiences may wonder is what the movie 
is about if this moment, toward which the film is so insistently pointed, is so 
without effect. 
</P>
<P>
From today's vantage point, "Murmur of the Heart's" strongest memory becomes 
its climate: political, familial, full of warmth, family jokes and indulged bad 
manners, brotherly acts of rivalry and support. This may be just what Malle was 
aiming for: in his words, "a contemporary comedy of French bourgeois 
education." (The film is MPAA-rated R.) What we see now is elegant detail, 
sharp observation, perfect performances (especially by Benoit Ferreux and the 
sublime Massari). And a possibly far-reaching moment that becomes simply one of 
those enigmatic Gallic shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
Could it really be as weightless as all that? Perhaps. Possibly. One wonders.
