THIS morning the builders will arrive with their bulldozers at the Quai de
la Gare in eastern Paris to begin work on the Bibliotheque de France, the
new national library which is the latest and most controversial of the
French government's recent architectural monuments.
The project, known as the tres grande bibliotheque in France, has been
clouded by controversy ever since Mr Dominique Perrault, its architect,
unveiled his first designs for a building with sunken study cloister and
giant glass storage towers.
Mr Perrault had conceived a building in which the readers would be 'buried'
underground in the cloister and the books, now in the old Bibliotheque
Nationale at the back of the Palais Royal in central Paris, would be stacked
in the 20-storey towers.
His design provoked a storm of criticism in the French press and from
scholars who claimed that France's academic treasures would be roasted by
the sun streaming through the glazed towers. President Francois Mitterrand
eventually agreed to consider the complaints, despite the opposition of Mr
Jack Lang, his minister of culture, who still supported the original design.
Mr Perrault was forced to modify his plans. The much-criticised glass towers
have been scaled down in size and more of the books will be stored
underground.
Even so, the construction of the library, scheduled to start last November
and to open in 1995, had to be delayed when a group of homeless families
squatted on the Quai de la Gare site. They have moved away, however, and the
Conseil Superieur des Bibliotheques, which runs France's libraries, has
approved Mr Perrault's new design. So the builders are finally free to begin
work on France's tres grande bibliotheque.
