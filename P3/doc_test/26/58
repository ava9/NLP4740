Torrance City Council members on Tuesday selected a nonprofit research firm 
from Menlo Park as their nominee for safety adviser at Mobil Oil's Torrance 
refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Describing SRI International as "clearly the best" out of an original field of 
30 candidates, council members said they were impressed by the firm's 
experience analyzing safety in the petrochemical field and in a number of other 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
The safety adviser position is a major component in the October pretrial 
settlement of a public nuisance lawsuit Torrance filed against Mobil in 1989. 
Under the terms of the agreement, the adviser will analyze safety at the 
refinery, make recommendations to improve safety measures and oversee the 
phasing out or modification of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil, however, has chosen another nominee for the position, and 
representatives of the company and the city will now try to work out a 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Tim Mock cast the only vote against SRI's selection, saying he 
wanted further details about a safety audit the firm conducted recently for an 
unnamed oil refinery. SRI's contract for that audit prevents the consultant 
from revealing who the client was or where the refinery is located. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Kenneth L. Nelson said city officials know only that the client was 
not Mobil Oil. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council's discussion of the safety adviser candidates took place 
behind closed doors, but the 6-1 vote was taken in public. State open-meeting 
laws prevented council members from conducting private interviews of the 
candidates, and council members said they did not want to conduct such 
interviews in public. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, a committee of city officials -- including the city manager, city 
attorney, fire chief, fire marshal and outside legal counsel -- screened the 
consultants. SRI was their unanimous recommendation from a list of four 
finalists, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil informed the city last month that its nominee for the position is 
Westinghouse's Energy Systems Business Unit, which is primarily involved in the 
design and service of commercial nuclear power plants but which also provides 
risk assessment for the nuclear and petrochemical industries. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil's Torrance refinery manager, Joel Maness, said Mobil is withholding 
judgment on SRI. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for me to say much at this point because I'm not at all familiar 
with SRI," Maness said. "We'll interview them and see what kind of experience 
and expertise they can bring to the role and then I'm sure we'll have more to 
say." 
</P>
<P>
City officials, who had until Wednesday to notify Mobil of their nominee, now 
must meet with Mobil representatives to try to work out a compromise on which 
consultant ultimately will serve as safety adviser. 
</P>
<P>
If the two sides cannot agree -- which Nelson said is likely to be the case -- 
the decision will be made by retired Superior Court Judge Harry V. Peetris, who 
is overseeing the consent decree. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said compromise negotiations will not begin until the second week in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Council members criticized Westinghouse as having little experience with 
refinery audits. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these organizations can go out and get you the expertise you want, 
but when somebody already has the experience, that's better than having someone 
else go out and put together a team for you," Councilman Bill Applegate said. 
"We feel that SRI is the best firm available to do the job." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said the city will remain open-minded during compromise discussions. 
</P>
<P>
"When we sit down (to talk), we may hear about experience that Westinghouse has 
had that we did not know about," he said. "Westinghouse is very, very good. I 
think SRI is a whole lot better." 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1946 as Stanford Research Institute, an arm of Stanford University, 
SRI gained prominence for its pioneering research in radar and laser technology 
for the U.S. Defense Department after the Korean War. The firm became 
completely independent of Stanford in 1970, said Dennis Maxwell, vice president 
for corporate marketing and communications. 
</P>
<P>
Now one of the largest nonprofit research firms in the United States, SRI 
employs more than 3,500 people in laboratories ranging from Princeton to 
Australia. At least 2,000 workers are employed at the company's headquarters in 
Menlo Park near Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"We do everything from pharmaceutical research . . . to policy work for 
economic competitiveness of states and countries to health care cost 
containment to physical sciences work and engineering work," Maxwell said. 
</P>
<P>
If selected to be safety adviser, SRI would view the project as a cross between 
health and safety consultation and environmental risk assessment, said William 
Ralston, manager of environmental business programs. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary objective of the consent decree is to protect the health and 
safety of both employees and the local residents," Ralston said. "We have 
worked for companies in the past who have asked us to do similar types of 
reviews of their facilities, really with the same objectives in mind. . . . 
This is right up our alley."
