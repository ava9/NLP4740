William Fairbank, whose work in low-temperature superconductivity laid the 
foundation for hundreds of scientific experiments worldwide, has died. He was 
72. 
</P>
<P>
Fairbank, professor emeritus of physics at Stanford University, suffered a 
heart attack Saturday while jogging near the Palo Alto campus, university 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fairbank researched the nature of superconductivity and participated in the 
search for gravity waves, subatomic particles called quarks, and monopoles, 
believed to be a component of magnetism. 
</P>
<P>
His work is the basis of a multimillion-dollar project to test a final unproven 
prediction of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. 
</P>
<P>
Fairbank, who worked in his lab the night before his death, believed in what he 
called the "Anti-Murphy Law of Physics." This held that when one understands an 
experimental situation correctly, three or four things come together to make 
the impossible possible. 
</P>
<P>
He performed his first superconductivity experiment in 1947 with his brother 
Henry, also a physicist.

Laser Advancement 
</P>
<P>
Fairbank's work centered on the ability of some materials to offer no 
resistance to an electrical current if they are cooled to near absolute zero. 
Stanford said Fairbank's influence on physics included the development at 
Stanford of the superconducting accelerator in which a linear accelerator is 
cooled to 2 degrees above absolute zero. The superconductivity allows for 
greater degrees of sensitivity and led to the first demonstration of a free 
electron laser. 
</P>
<P>
His research often led into other areas. In 1975 he developed a machine in an 
experimental program that killed cancer cells without damage to organs or 
tissue. Designed for use on cancers of the mouth and throat and certain brain 
and lung tumors, the "Medical Pion Generator" used a stream of pions -- 
subatomic particles generated by a high-energy accelerator -- to kill the cells 
with minute nuclear explosions. 
</P>
<P>
Fairbank was born in Minneapolis, graduated from Whitman College in Washington 
and earned his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining Stanford in 1959, he taught at the University of Washington, 
Amherst College and Duke University and worked on the staff of the Radiation 
Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
