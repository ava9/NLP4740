A drug used for more than a decade to treat psoriasis is preventing and halting 
the rejection of transplanted organs in animals, a Stanford University 
researcher said. The compound will be tested on human transplant patients 
pending approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said Dr. Randall 
Morris, director of Stanford's laboratory for transplant immunology. The drug 
mycophenolic acid inhibits the formation of DNA, critical in the growth of skin 
lesions common to psoriasis. Researchers altered mycophenolic acid to make it 
more easily absorbed by the body. In its altered form, it defuses the DNA 
process required for white blood cells to attack transplanted organs, Morris 
said.
