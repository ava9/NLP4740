<F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "People": "Jerzy </F>
Milewski"] 
  [Text] The person of Jerzy Milewski has become, following 
the reorganization by Minister [of Defense Piotr] Kolodziejczyk, 
a bone of contention between the coalition government and the 
Belweder [presidential residence, hence a reference to President 
Lech Walesa's role]. Jerzy Milewski currently holds in his hands 
three functions: deputy minister of national defense; chief of 
the National Security Office (BBN), which comes under the 
Belweder's jurisdiction; and secretary of the National Defense 
Committee. 
  Defense Minister Kolodziejczyk's expansion of Milewski's 
duties in MON [Ministry of National Defense] is seen by the 
coalition government as an attempt to prevent the coalition from 
gaining access and influence in that ministry. Jerzy 
Szmajdzinski of the SLD (Democratic Left Alliance), chairman of 
the Sejm Commission on National Defense, is demanding that the 
prime minister explicitly state the scope of Milewski's 
authority. Lech Falandysz, the Belweder secretary of state, does 
not think that Milewski's being dismissed from his position 
comes into play because "the prime minister would have to take 
into account that, following Milewski's dismissal, the MON chief 
does not intend to propose anyone else, and, without his 
recommendation, the prime minister cannot appoint anyone else." 
  Jerzy Milewski was born in 1935 in Lopuchowek. He completed 
his studies at the Gdansk Polytechnic [Institute of Technology], 
followed by a doctorate in 1966. He continued his scientific 
career at the Institute of Flow Mechanics Machinery of PAN 
(State Academy of Sciences) in Gdansk, at the University of 
Illinois in Chicago, at Stanford University in California, and 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was in charge 
of the Coordination Office of NSZZ Solidarity [Independent 
Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity"] in Brussels. Following 
his return to Poland, he aligned himself with the presidential 
center of power--he has headed the BBN since January 1991. 
  Milewski is divorced and has two children. In his free time, 
he enjoys mountain climbing.
