NEW LESSONS AT STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week a bucolic corner of the Stanford University campus produced one 
rather commonplace lesson: Never throw anything away just because it is not 
absolutely up to date. From that, though, will flow cosmic lessons almost 
beyond the imagining of ordinary folk, let alone their comprehension. As Burton 
Richter, director of Stanford's Linear Accelerator Center, puts it, what comes 
next will help scientists who are "trying to understand what's in the mind of 
God." 
</P>
<P>
The something not quite up to date is the 20-year-old accelerator, which 
Richter and a team of scientists modified for $115 million -- peanuts in the 
big-science business where people think in billions -- by adding a loop to the 
end of an existing 2-mile-long tunnel through which sub-atomic particles ride 
waves of electric power. The accelerator now sends positrons into the loop in 
one direction and electrons in the other so that they collide at nearly the 
speed of light. The nuclear debris from what used to be called atom-smashing is 
scattered into a big concrete pillbox packed with instruments that sort out and 
identify the bits and pieces. 
</P>
<P>
The cosmic aspect stems from the fact that after two anxious years of trying to 
calibrate the modified atom-smasher, Stanford's instruments detected a Z 
particle in the debris Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Z particle is what Richter and his colleagues had been looking for. With 
the tricky business of calibration apparently solved, according to spokesman 
Michael Riordan, Stanford may become the world's largest supplier of Z 
particles by the end of summer. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the Z particles important to physicists is that they existed 
naturally for about one-trillionth of a second after the Big Bang that 
scientific theory says created the universe, and then they decayed. By creating 
Zs in a collider and observing the artificial particles decay, physicists can 
add one more level to what they know about how and why our galaxy and other 
galaxies arranged themselves as they did. 
</P>
<P>
It also is a crucial step toward what Sidney Drell, co-director of the 
accelerator center, calls the Holy Grail of physics, a grand unifying theory 
that would explain the relationship between gravity and electromagnetism. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's Z is not the first ever trapped in an atom-smasher. The first was 
detected six years ago in the collider of the European Center for Nuclear 
Research near Geneva by a team of researchers who were awarded the Nobel prize 
for physics for their effort. 
</P>
<P>
But Stanford may become the first mass producer of the heaviest sub-atomic 
particle now known to exist, the one that may hold the key to understanding 
how, in a trillionth of a second, the pattern was set for everything that 
exists billions of years later. It is good to see California again on the 
cutting edge of science. But the real cause for celebration is one more lesson 
wrung from science, one more lesson that compels us to ponder once more the 
wonders of physical discovery, discovery with the power to make the mind both 
wince and dance.
