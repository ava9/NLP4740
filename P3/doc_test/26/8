Stanford University officials proposed to ban alcohol consumption at all 
Stanford athletic events. The proposal was prompted in part by the 27 
alcohol-related arrests at the Stanford-UC Berkeley football game in November.

Stanford has been the only school in the Pacific-10 athletic conference to 
allow spectators to bring alcohol inside a stadium. Three years ago, Stanford 
banned hard liquor at games and limited each person over 21 to carrying in one 
six-pack of beer. The proposal would also prohibit advertising of alcohol at 
university events, declare anyone convicted of drunk driving ineligible for 
university parking permits and ban the purchase of alcohol with student fees 
collected by the university. Final approval by President Donald Kennedy is 
expected later this year. "We're probably at the point now where we are better 
off saying 'no alcohol.' I find it hard to believe that people can't go three 
hours without a drink," said Marv Herrington, the university's director of 
public safety.
