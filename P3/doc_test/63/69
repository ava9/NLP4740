campaign: Even in one of the president's best states, his advisers warn they
may be unable to cut Buchanan's share of the vote to below 30 per cent

FOUR years ago South Carolina gave a crucial lift to Mr George Bush on his
road to the presidency.
The southern Atlantic state, home of the late Mr Lee Atwater, Republican
party chairman and Bush campaign manager, produced for Mr Bush a primary
victory over his main challengers, Senator Robert Dole and Mr Pat Robertson,
the revivalist preacher.
Later, in his general election battle against Governor Michael Dukakis, Mr
Bush won 62 per cent of South Carolina's vote, one of his highest scores
anywhere.
Today, Mr Bush needs an even more emphatic victory as he seeks an early coup
de grace over his outspoken right-wing challenger, Mr Patrick Buchanan.
The Bush campaign no longer has Mr Atwater to guide it, but it still has the
vigorous support of Governor Carroll Campbell, South Carolina's dominant
politician.
Mr Campbell also spearheaded Mr Bush's campaign in the neighbouring state of
Georgia, where Mr Buchanan won 30 per cent of the vote in last week's
primary. Even with the behind them, Mr Bush's advisers are warning they may
still be unable to cut Mr Buchanan's share of the vote below 30 per cent.
But Bush campaign officials also acknowledge that, with Governor Campbell's
strong backing, South Carolina ought to be one of the president's best
states.
Campaigning this week in Columbia, South Carolina's state capital, Mr Bush
declined to attack his rival by name. But he cautiously criticised the
protectionist theme Mr Buchanan has emphasised in his campaign. Closing the
US's borders to trade could put 125,000 export-oriented jobs in South
Carolina at risk, Mr Bush warned.
In the textile mills around Greenville and Spartanburg, however,
protectionism may win Mr Buchanan some votes. Senator Ernest Hollings, South
Carolina's Democratic senator since 1966, has long advocated textile import
quotas.
Senator Hollings has recently taken to Japan-bashing in a remarkably
tasteless fashion: responding to Japanese politicians who called American
workers lazy and illiterate, he noted that these same American workers had
produced a bomb and tested their handiwork at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
President Bush has refused repeated invitations to condemn Mr Buchanan's
overt appeals to racial politics. This reluctance may have little effect in
today's primary, but in the November general election it could cost him the
support of black voters, who make up 30 per cent of South Carolina's
population and who helped re-elect Governor Campbell in 1990.
Mr Buchanan, however, will have to share the racist vote with Mr David Duke.
South Carolina is the first state in which the former Ku Klux Klan leader's
name is on the ballot. Mr Duke's campaigning has been lackadaisical,
however, and he is not expected to win a big share of today's vote.
Mr Bush is competing with Mr Buchanan for South Carolina's large Christian
fundamentalist population. In 1988, one Republican primary voter in three
identified himself or herself as a born-again Christian.
Both Mr Buchanan and vice-president Dan Quayle have campaigned at Bob Jones
University, the Protestant university at Greenville, and Mr Buchanan has
made hay with a Treasury move to make churches submit lists of large donors
to the Internal Revenue Service.
Among the Democratic candidates, Governor Bill Clinton is expected to repeat
the formula with which he won Georgia's primary last week: strong
endorsements from local politicians, an overwhelming majority of black
voters, and a strong appeal to lower and middle-income whites.
Senator Tom Harkin, however, has sought votes in South Carolina's industrial
areas, and campaigned in the state last week with Mr Jesse Jackson, who
swept the Democratic caucus here in 1988 with 55 per cent of the votes.
