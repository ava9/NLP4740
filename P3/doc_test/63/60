THE Memorial Day holiday on Monday marks the official start of America's
summer. But this one only brings warmth to the most unlikely presidential
aspirant of this or any other year, the billionaire from Texas, Mr H Ross
Perot.
A poll out yesterday said he had a good chance of winning in November. The
CNN-USA Today survey gave him and President George Bush 35 per cent each and
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas 25 per cent. Perversely, it also found
that only one in five surveyed thought Mr Perot would actually become the
next president.
Recent opinion polls have settled down to a pattern with either Mr Perot or
Mr Bush in the lead and the likely Democratic nominee third, with the gap
usually in single figures.
But a pattern is emerging in the polls, with Mr Bush seen as the strongest
only on conservative social policy issues such as law and order and either
Mr Clinton or Mr Perot ahead in the perception of their abilities to handle
every other domestic and economic problem.
This gives the lie - at least temporarily - to the widely held belief that
an improving economy will come to the president's rescue in the end. In fact
the recovery remains generally weak and regionally spotty, explaining, for
example, Mr Bush's weakness in the west, where the economy lags.
The Arkansas governor's current problem is that although he is on the verge
of securing his party's nomination he has virtually disappeared from the
media.
Given the critical scrutiny accorded Mr Clinton earlier, he might have
welcomed this relief. But the inability to make the public aware of policies
he would implement to stop inner cities erupting again has left him
marginalised.
Yesterday he did secure a national television interview. He castigated
administration social policies, and described Mr Perot as 'a brilliant sound
bite politician', adding 'people don't know what he would do, but they think
they know what he stands for and it sounds good to them.'
Mr Clinton insisted that he and Mr Perot agreed on many issues, perhaps
because they were born only 35 miles apart. But, having campaigned as the
candidate of 'change', he senses Mr Perot is stealing his clothes. 'It's
harder for me to make that case because I've been a governor and an elected
official,' he said. 'I've got to show I've got a record of actually doing
some of the things Mr Perot is talking about.'
This explicitly recognises the reason for Mr Perot's current strength - a
great lack of public confidence in the ability of the conventional political
system to deliver the economic and social goods.
If Mr Perot is vulnerable, it will probably be on his record as a ruthless
tycoon intolerant of dissent and always willing to cut corners to achieve an
end. Meanwhile Mr Clinton struggles to be heard and Mr Bush lets Mr Quayle
preach the older doctrines of conservatism. It promises to be a long, hot
summer of political discontent.
