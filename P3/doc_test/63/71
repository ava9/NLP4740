Here we go again. An articulate, young(ish) Democratic presidential
candidate promising new ideas and a new direction for America is on the
brink of self-destruction.
All is not lost; but unless Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas manages a
reasonable showing in the New Hampshire primary election next Tuesday, he
faces the prospect of a fall from grace no less stunning than the collapse
of Senator Gary Hart's campaign in 1987.
Allegations of infidelity have hurt Mr Clinton, but they are less clear-cut
than those which ruined Mr Hart, whose philandering was captured in a
photograph of him with a pin-up girl aboard a boat, appropriately named
Monkey Business. Far more damaging to Mr Clinton are the charges of
draft-dodging during the Vietnam war, which now threaten to reawaken the
conflicts which polarised the country more than 25 years ago.
In some ways, the furore mirrors the controversy that erupted in the 1988
presidential campaign after it emerged that then-Senator Dan Quayle had
avoided combat duty in Vietnam by obtaining a much-coveted place in the
Indiana National Guard. Then, as now, many Americans asked themselves
whether anyone could run for president or vice-president who belonged to the
Vietnam generation and sought, however briefly, to avoid military service.
Mr Todd Gitlin, a sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley,
believes that the next two or three presidential campaigns will be haunted
by these conflicts. 'A whole generation of middle-class guys faced a moral
anguish and resolved it in a variety of ways. I'm not so sure there were any
clean outcomes, not with this sort of morality play.'
Even some of Mr Clinton's supporters voiced concern about his character.
Campaigning alongside the governor in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, last
Tuesday, Mr Don Mitchell, a former local mayor, said: 'It's not just
Vietnam. It was the sex, the drugs, the mini-revolution we had in 1968.
Anyone who steps up to run for president from this generation has this
problem.'
Just four weeks ago, Mr Clinton looked as if he had the nomination within
his grasp. Influential US newspapers wrote gushing profiles about the bright
young man who was ready to reform the 20-year-old liberal Democratic
orthodoxy which has led the party to five defeats in the last six
presidential elections.
Mr Clinton is not easily typecast. He talks about civil rights, such as the
right of women to choose an abortion, but stresses responsibilities, too. He
supports tighter work requirements for welfare recipients and sanctions
against high-school drop-outs such as the withdrawal of a driving licence.
He is without doubt the candidate who has thought most about the issues. He
is blessed with boyish good looks and an infectious charm, without the
brooding, loner instincts of Mr Hart.
Even the Democratic party establishment in Washington laid aside its doubts
about his pedigree. Sensing that President Bush might be vulnerable in
November, the elders embraced the outsider from the south who could appeal
across liberal/conservative lines. In a word, he possessed 'electability'.
This electability is now in grave doubt.
Mr Clinton's slide began when two New York City tabloids gave front-page
treatment to old allegations about an extra-marital affair put forward by a
cabaret singer in Little Rock, Ms Gennifer Flowers. These stories had been
checked and dismissed by the Arkansas press, according to Mr Ernie Dumas, a
columnist at the Arkansas Gazette.
At first, the mainstream US press was reluctant to run the adultery story,
knowing that Mr Clinton had sought to inoculate himself by admitting
publicly to unspecified marital difficulties.
More seriously, many in the media were wary of being accused of doing the
Republicans' dirty work. Memories of the shallow 1988 campaign - when
symbols such as pledging allegiance to the flag became more important than
the future of the US economy - remain fresh.
Thus, when Mr Clinton's strategists urged reporters to stick to issues, many
reporters were willing to accommodate them (even though the resulting
coverage favoured Mr Clinton, who carries five-point plans in his hip
pocket).
In the past fortnight, as the New Hampshire primary drew closer, all leading
news organisations lost their squeamishness. This shift in mood stems partly
from a realisation that the market in Clinton futures had skyrocketed in
December and January, without any real press scrutiny of the product. More
important was Mr Clinton's own inability to lay the rumours about his
extra-marital conduct to rest just at the time when he became the
media-crowned front-runner.
In an effort to salvage his campaign, Mr Clinton went on national television
with his wife, Hillary, and admitted to 'wrongdoing'. But the confession
raised more questions which the tabloid press eagerly followed.
Enter the Wall Street Journal. Ten days ago, the Journal reported that Mr
Clinton, when a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, gained a place in the Reserve
Officer Training Corps (ROTC) after pledging to attend the University of
Arkansas Law School - a ruse which allowed him to defer military service for
four years.
Again, the story was old, but there was a new twist: a disgruntled Arkansas
reserve officer, now retired, supplied ABC News with a letter in which Mr
Clinton expresses thanks for 'saving me from the draft'. He also
acknowledges misleading the ROTC about his opposition to the war and his
intention to serve in the programme.
Mr Clinton was forced to make public the whole letter, which makes poignant
reading. Here is a 23-year-old, a gifted student, from a troubled, poor
family, wrestling with his conscience. He is anxious to avoid any action
which could harm his future political career ('I do not think our system of
government is by definition corrupt') - a clear sign he wants to remain in
the political mainstream.
Consumed by guilt about his efforts to evade military service, he ended up
submitting himself to the draft. However tortured, this enabled him to argue
that he was, in fact, willing to serve his country (he drew a high lottery
number and was therefore not required to serve).
Mr Clinton's stand on Vietnam contrasts favourably with thousands of
middle-class Americans who were content to let less privileged minority
groups, notably black Americans, fight the Vietcong while they embarked on
their professional careers. Others, such as Mr Quayle and Mr Dick Cheney,
the defence secretary, secured deferments by dint of their college careers.
Vietnam was indeed a class war.
Yet these subtleties may not be so easy to convey in a modern US
presidential campaign, when television forces politicians to deliver their
messages inside 15 seconds, and TV demeanour is often viewed as the most
reliable gauge of personal trustworthiness.
Mr Clinton, nicknamed 'Slick Willy' in his home state, may come across as
just a little too smooth; the fact that he has admitted to personal mistakes
on two significant issues - marriage and the Vietnam war - at this juncture
in the campaign may cost him dear.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa pronounced, perhaps prematurely, that the Clinton
candidacy was doomed. Senator Bob Kerrey, himself a Vietnam war hero who
lost half a leg and ought to benefit from Mr Clinton's troubles, has
vacillated, as so often in this campaign. 'I do not want to re-open the
wounds of Vietnam,' he said.
Congressional Democrats such as Senator Lloyd Bentsen and Congressman
Richard Gephardt are taking a second look at the risks of entering the race
at this late stage. Governor Mario Cuomo of New York refuses to disown a
'draft Cuomo' movement in New Hampshire aimed at showing that voters are
unhappy with the current crop of candidates and want an outsider to enter
the race.
Any late-entering Democrat faces huge obstacles. When the polls close in New
Hampshire, primary filing deadlines will have passed for states that account
for almost 60 per cent of the delegates who select the presidential nominee
at the July Democratic Convention in New York.
Yet the party hungers for a winner. Mr Clinton's contribution to date has
been to push the party in a direction in which it can recapture the middle
class which deserted the Democrats in droves in the 1970s and 1980s. But he
is still dispensable. 'Remember,' said a southern supporter on Capitol Hill:
'It is the message, not the messenger, that matters.'
