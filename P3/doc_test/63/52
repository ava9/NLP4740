Closing a swift tour of four Latin countries, Vice President Dan Quayle arrived 
in impoverished Haiti on Thursday with a plea and a blunt warning that unless 
its military allows free elections in November, it faces more cuts in foreign 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
Using unusually tough language for a diplomatic setting, Quayle told a meeting 
of Haitian military officers in the Presidential Palace: 
</P>
<P>
"We take note of the assurances of the Haitian army that they will not allow a 
coup and that they will not allow the democratic process to be impeded. So my 
message is: No coup. No murders. No threats. And, instead, free and fair 
elections that will bring honor to the brave people of Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, speaking with reporters on his plane en route from Bolivia, the vice 
president, discussing the Haitian elections, said, "If you are going to have a 
country that is not democratic and is not respectful of human rights, they are 
not going to be recipients of the American taxpayers' money." 
</P>
<P>
American economic aid of $100 million a year was cut drastically in 1987 when 
the armed forces, still linked to the despised dictatorships of Presidents 
Francois Duvalier and his son, Jean-Claude, turned elections into a violent and 
bloody sham by allowing thugs to massacre more than 30 civilians trying to 
vote. Since then, U.S. aid has risen to $60 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
New elections have been set for Nov. 4, and Quayle, in his meetings with Gen. 
Herard Abraham, commander-in-chief of the Haitian armed forces, and his top 
officers, clearly wanted to ensure that these elections are allowed to proceed 
democratically. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Gen. Abraham is committed to having secure elections," Quayle told 
reporters. "The question is whether he can implement this." 
</P>
<P>
He said it was important that outsiders like himself come to Haiti before the 
elections to impress upon the military the importance of free elections. He 
mentioned former President Jimmy Carter and President Carlos Andres Perez of 
Venezuela as others who have come to Haiti on similar missions. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Haiti, despite the overthrow of the younger Duvalier in February, 
1986, stands with Cuba as the only holdouts against democracy in the 
hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Bush Administration, which has offered Haiti $3 million to organize 
free and secure elections, wants the United Nations to send observers to the 
Haiti elections. He discussed this Tuesday, he said, with Perez and President 
Cesar Gaviria of Colombia, but he ran into a snag. 
</P>
<P>
While the Bush Administration wants the United Nations to act swiftly through 
the Security Council, Perez and Gaviria want action to be taken by the U.N. 
General Assembly, which, unlike the Security Council, is dominated by Third 
World countries. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a plausible argument," Quayle said, "but time is of the essence." He said 
he fears that the General Assembly would act too slowly on observers for Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle seemed generally optimistic about the chances for fair elections in 
Haiti, but he told reporters: "I'm not going to disabuse you of the fact that 
there are some very bad people in Haiti. It's a very divided country."
