PRESIDENT George Bush promised yesterday to 'fight tough but fight fair' to
retain the White House against Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic party
nominee.
He told a conservative audience in Colorado Springs that perhaps he had been
'a little slow' in the campaign so far to the point that the election has
seemed 'a little one-sided'.
Complaining that Mr Clinton, whom Mr Bush still tries not to mention by
name, criticises him every five seconds, the president said the gloves would
be off after the Republican convention in Houston the week after next. 'I am
tired of being slugged by these people,' he asserted.
His pugnacity was well received, as similar performances before Catholic and
veterans' organisations had been a day earlier in New York and Nevada. But
in both cases he told his audiences what they wanted to hear - respectively
that abortion was wrong and that there was no substitute for a strong
defence.
But the wider American public still seems unimpressed. The latest national
opinion poll, compiled for the Washington Post and ABC News, has Mr Bush's
approval rating down to 33 per cent, a 5 point drop in a month, while an
earlier Gallup poll for CNN had him at an all-time low of 29 per cent, a
depth from which no incumbent president has recovered to win re-election.
Both surveys suggest Mr Clinton's lead has not narrowed since his party's
convention in New York last month. This contrasts with 1988, when Mr Michael
Dukakis, the Democratic candidate, lost half his 17 point post-convention
edge within two weeks.
His determination notwithstanding, this has also been a difficult week for
Mr Bush, first because he had to disown a savagely worded attack on Mr
Clinton by his political director and, second, because of new criticisms
that he was not doing enough to stop the slaughter in Bosnia.
Additionally, the Washington Post speculated yesterday that when Mr James
Baker, the secretary of state, takes over the White House and the campaign
later this month there will be a wholesale house cleaning of the present
re-election team.
This assumes that Mr Baker will come back, on which no announcement has yet
been made, and that he will bring with him his inner circle from the state
department, most of whom worked on the 1988 Bush campaign.
