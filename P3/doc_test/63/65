Leading Republicans have barely savoured the triumph of last week's crushing
victory in the US congressional elections before setting their sights on the
presidential election in 1996.
Small towns in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first states to hold ballots in
the 1996 primaries, have been crowded over the last three days with hopeful
Republican candidates, as Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Senator Arlen
Specter of Pennsylvania formally threw their hats into the ring for their
party's presidential nomination.
It came as no surprise that Mr Gramm, an abrasively conservative economics
professor, should announce that he was filing papers this week with the
Federal Election Commission to put the legal structure in place for a
campaign.
Mr Gramm has made no secret of his plans, and clearly wishes to capitalise
on last week's election success, for which, as chairman of the Republican
senate campaign committee, he can claim at least partial credit.
But Mr Specter's announcement that he is 'exploring' a candidacy is seen as
a more quixotic venture - and perhaps a sign that the Republicans' prospects
are not so unclouded as they might appear after last week's triumph, which
has led many in the party to conclude that President Bill Clinton is
destined to follow the last Democrat in the White House as a one-term
president.
For a moderate such as Mr Specter to run, with minimal hopes of winning,
suggests that the party could have trouble remaining united after its tilt
to the right in recent years.
His candidacy would resemble in some respects that of Mr Paul Tsongas in the
1992 Democratic primaries - a bid to pull his party back towards the centre,
more than a realistic quest for the nomination.
In his announcement yesterday Mr Specter took aim at 'spoilers' such as Mr
Pat Robertson, the conservative Christian leader, and Mr Pat Buchanan, the
former Nixon speechwriter whose maverick candidacy so irked former President
George Bush in 1992.
'It is important at the outset to focus on the far-right fringe,' Mr Specter
said.
A host of other Republican hopefuls could enter the lists. Senator Robert
Dole, the acid-tongued leader of the new Senate majority, said he would make
up his mind by February 15. At least six members of Mr Bush's cabinet -
secretary of state James Baker, defence secretary Dick Cheney, labour
secretary Lynn Martin, housing secretary Jack Kemp, vice-president Dan
Quayle and education secretary Lamar Alexander - are also possible
candidates.
Of these, Mr Kemp started with the most public esteem but it is Mr Alexander
who now appears to have the best position.
A former governor of Tennessee, he is not widely known but has built a
strong political network, and is likely to win wider support among the 31
Republican governors than other candidates more rooted in Washington.
Iowa, which holds party caucuses in January of a presidential election year
to decide who to nominate for the presidency, counted for little in 1992
because Senator Tom Harkin, a candidate for the Democratic nomination, was
widely expected to sweep his home state. New Hampshire holds the first
presidential primary in the country.
Both states have in the past provided an important springboard for
candidates to raise their national profiles and to attract money for their
campaigns in the rest of the country.
In 1996, however, California and New York will both hold their primaries
much earlier in the process, instead of waiting to the end.
Campaign managers believe, therefore, that a serious candidate will need a
good organisation and at least Dollars 30m in hand by January 1996.
