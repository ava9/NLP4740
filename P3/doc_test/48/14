<P>
A senior U.S. official embarrassed those attending a Pacific Rim trade summit 
and offended Soviet and Chinese delegates by attacking Marxism and using a 
mocking Chinese accent to tell a joke about Soviet women. 
</P>
<P>
Fred M. Zeder II, head of the government's Overseas Private Investment Corp., 
made the comments Tuesday in a speech that left organizers red-faced and many 
foreign delegates shaking their heads in embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
Zeder, 68, was the first speaker on the second and last day of the $1-million 
Pacific Summit, the centerpiece of Washington state's centennial celebration. 
He was appointed to head OPIC by President Bush earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Began With Joke 
</P>
<P>
Zeder began his address with a joke in which China's late Chairman Mao Zedong 
is asked by a foreign journalist what "might have happened if Lee Harvey Oswald 
had assassinated Khrushchev rather than President Kennedy." 
</P>
<P>
Mimicking a Chinese accent, Zeder said Mao replied: "Only one thing certain. 
Aristotle Onassis would not have married Mrs. Khrushchev." 
</P>
<P>
Few listeners were amused, delegates said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was only a joke, but I don't like the joke," said Lu Zu-wen, commercial 
consul for the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco. "He's a joker. I don't know 
what his purpose was." 
</P>
<P>
Zeder accused the Soviets of "marching into Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia," of 
"bringing Castro's Cuban mercenaries into Nicaragua, Angola and Ethiopia" and 
of spreading Marxism "every place in the world." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Dismal Failure' 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone who has tried that Marxist-Leninist form of economy and ideology are 
now openly admitting that their system was a dismal failure," Zeder said. 
</P>
<P>
Zeder described how shortly after World War II a German businessman introduced 
himself and then said, "I never was a Nazi" while giving a Nazi-style salute. 
</P>
<P>
"Now every place I go in the world, people say, 'I never was a socialist.' You 
know, they all want to get on the privatization bandwagon." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet delegate Vyacheslav Zilanov drew applause from other participants at a 
later forum when he criticized Zeder's remarks, particularly his harsh attack 
on Marxism. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't agree with some of the opinions put forward by Zeder in his morning 
speech," Zilanov said. "I don't feel this Pacific Summit is the right place to 
discuss Marxist-Leninist theory and its position right now."
