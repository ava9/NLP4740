IT IS the ultimate treasure trove for historians, journalists, conspiracy
theorists and Kennedy-worshippers: 800,000 pages of documents relating to
the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy, released to the public
yesterday.
The huge archive was opened for inspection in Washington nearly 30 years
after Mr Kennedy's death, following a bill passed in Congress last year that
ordered the disclosure of almost all government records on the case.
These include most of the few files which have not yet been published from
the Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination under the
chairmanship of former Chief Justice Earl Warren, as well as documents from
congressional committees and 90,000 pages from the Central Intelligence
Agency.
Early finds in the CIA records include a secret internal memorandum
speculating that the Soviet Union had most to gain from the assassination,
although offering no concrete evidence of Soviet involvement.
The Warren Commission's central conclusion, that Mr Kennedy was killed by
Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone, has been backed up by most serious inquiries
since then, with the exception of a 1979 House of Representatives select
committee chaired by Mr Louis Stokes, an Ohio Democrat, which found that a
second gunman probably fired at Mr Kennedy and missed.
Most recently, pathologists and doctors who examined Mr Kennedy's body in
Dallas in 1963 reaffirmed in the Journal of the American Medical Association
their original finding that the president was struck by only two bullets,
one of which caused the head wounds that killed him. Both were fired from
above and behind, they said.
Nevertheless, US public opinion has never accepted this verdict, preferring
a series of theories involving a second assassin, as well as Cuban, Russian,
Mafia or CIA backing for Oswald.
Oswald himself was shot before standing trial.
Even in the 1980s opinion polls showed two thirds of those questioned
believed there was a conspiracy to kill Mr Kennedy, compared with only 13
per cent who believed Oswald acted alone.
Mr Oliver Stone's film JFK last year brought a new intensity to the already
thriving Kennedy conspiracy industry.
The law ordering the opening of the assassination archive came in response
to an upsurge created by the film in public questioning of the Warren
report.
But members of Congress, including Mr Stokes, warn that no matter what is
released it will not be enough to quell public suspicion.
