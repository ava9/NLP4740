THE ANTI-CIA MURAL IN ECUADOR'S CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re James F. Smith's "The Painter and the Yanquis," Nov. 29: Smith writes, " . . 
. some Americans denounce (artist Oswaldo Guayasamin) as a leftist ingrate 
guilty of perfidious insult to the United States." This is in reference to a 
Nazi helmet with the letters "CIA" emblazoned on it which appears in 
Guayasamin's mural in Ecuador's Congress. 
</P>
<P>
If Americans such as U.S. Ambassador Richard Holwill find Guayasamin's mural 
offensive to the point of demanding that President of Congress Wilfrido Lucero 
climb a ladder in order to paint over the letters, then I suggest that this is 
a typically insidious case of Yanqui arrogance approaching Khomeini-style 
intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than removing the letters from the mural, the nefarious and completely 
un-American institution of the CIA should be totally and permanently removed 
from this hemisphere.
