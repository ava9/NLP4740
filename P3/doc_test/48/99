FAMILY OF MAN KILLED BY DEPUTIES YEAR AGO STILL MOURNS FOR HIM 
</P>

A year after an unarmed Cerritos man was shot and killed by Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies after a lengthy car chase, 30 family members and friends 
gathered Wednesday in Cypress at the grave of Hong Pyo Lee to remember him and 
to press their demands for legal action against the deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office, following a six-week 
investigation last spring, cleared five deputies of criminal wrongdoing in the 
shooting, which drew loud cries of racial discrimination and police brutality 
from the Korean community. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lee's parents have filed a $5.5-million federal lawsuit alleging 
that Lee's civil rights were violated. The U.S. Department of Justice is also 
conducting an investigation into the civil rights issue, according to attorneys 
for the Lee family and for the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday's service at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Lee's relatives and 
their attorney, George V. Denny III, maintained that pretrial depositions from 
two Long Beach police officers, Richard R. Boatwright and Mario Razo, reinforce 
their contention that the 21-year-old Lee was killed wrongfully. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach officers, who had pursued Lee along with the deputies and 
witnessed the fatal shooting, both stated in sworn depositions that they were 
"amazed" at the deputies' conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, according to the deposition transcript, seven-year police veteran 
Boatwright said that, after the shooting, he turned to Razo, and said, "We just 
observed the sheriff's execute somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Boatwright nor Razo, who said in his deposition that he could not 
remember Boatwright using the word execution, could be reached Wednesday for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney David D. Lawrence, representing the Sheriff's Department, Wednesday 
questioned the Long Beach officers' accounts, saying, "I'm confident the 
deputies acted properly and did what they had to do." 
</P>
<P>
At the graveside service, Lee's father, liquor store owner Sung Kyu Lee, 
tearfully declared, "It is wrong what happened and justice should be served 
here. . . . We have to get to the bottom of this." 
</P>
<P>
The incident began when Lee, driving late at night in an unincorporated area 
near Lynwood, was spotted by sheriff's deputies running a stop sign. Rather 
than pull over, Lee accelerated and led deputies on a 15-mile chase that ended 
in a north Long Beach industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guns Drawn 
</P>
<P>
The five deputies got out of their vehicles with their guns drawn, and one, 
John Chapman, 30, approached the driver's side of Lee's vehicle, demanding that 
Lee get out. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies told investigators later that they fired at Lee only after he 
suddenly shifted his car into reverse and attempted to run them down. That 
account was corroborated by a truck driver, who told investigators that he was 
parked nearby and saw the entire incident. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's report concluded that the deputies acted in 
self-defense when they shot Lee nine times. An autopsy had found traces of 
cocaine in his body. 
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard B. Healey acknowledged in his report that 
Razo and Boatwright contradicted the five deputies and the truck driver. The 
two Long Beach officers told investigators that Lee's car never moved backward 
toward the deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"Such conflicts in the evidence are not unusual," Healey wrote, "and do not 
necessarily have sinister significance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Give Added Details 
</P>
<P>
In their subsequent pretrial depositions last October, the Long Beach officers 
elaborated. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the lives of the deputies appeared to be in danger when they fired 
their weapons, Razo replied, "Not what I could see, no." The officer added that 
the shooting did not appear to be a justifiable homicide. 
</P>
<P>
Boatwright, when asked how he characterized the incident to Razo, said he "used 
the word execution." Razo, however, said he could not remember Boatwright using 
the term. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Lawrence on Wednesday questioned the "execution" statement, saying 
that "if it happened, it would have been remembered (by Razo)." 
</P>
<P>
Healey, contacted Wednesday, said Boatwright did not use the term execution 
during the district attorney's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Be Reopened 
</P>
<P>
"We're always open to the possibility of reopening a case if dramatic new 
evidence comes forward," Healey said. 
</P>
<P>
Denny, who is representing the Lee family in their civil suit scheduled for 
trial in July, said Wednesday, "I would like to see the case reopened (but) I 
have severe doubts whether, at this time, (the district attorney's office) has 
any inclination that way at all." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think justice has been served yet," Denny added. " . . . It is clear 
from the testimony there was no need to shoot (Lee)."
