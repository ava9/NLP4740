The man at the centre was a gifted professional politician reacting to
events he often neither foresaw nor understood, handling some well, others
badly, but always ready with a plausible explanation. He was intelligent,
detached, curious, candid if not always honest, and he was careless and
dangerously disorganised.'
He was also in his mid-40s, partly educated in Britain, married, a Democrat
and president of the United States. Just about every word quoted above could
be applied to the current inhabitant of the White House, Bill Clinton.
Of course, they do not. They are an extract from Richard Reeves's assessment
of the character of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. But as the world relives,
through written words and television programmes beyond number, what it was
doing on November 22 1963, when he was assassinated in Dallas, comparisons
between the second- and third-youngest presidents this century cannot be
avoided.
Kennedy and Clinton did once meet. On July 24 1963, the 17-year-old from
Arkansas, representing a youth group, shook hands with the president on the
White House lawn, a moment captured on film for the Kennedy archives and
shown to wild applause at last year's Democratic party convention. This was
no accident, for the Kennedy mantle is one which every aspiring young
Democratic politician has sought to put on.
America had changed much since then, for good (civil rights), for ill (the
rising tide of violence), and for even more in between. What Richard Reeves
has done, in his riveting President Kennedy; Profile of Power*, is to
provide all the benchmarks that make political comparisons possible. He
writes not of JFK's rise, nor of his death, but only about his term in
office. The subject of sex is not skimped but nor is it exaggerated.
If additional testimony for this exceptional book were needed, Bill Clinton
(henceforth, for stylistic juxtaposition, WJC) devoured it and promptly had
the author round to a White House lunch. Their conversation, reported Mr
Reeves, was all about then and now. 'His identification with Kennedy is
quite close,' he added.
Style and background apart, similarities and differences leap out of every
page. Both relied on those nearest and usually dearest - JFK on his brother,
Robert, whom he made attorney-general, WJC on his wife Hillary, an
ex-officio member of the government in most things and a policy maker on
healthcare. JFK hardly knew most of his first Cabinet, though it contained
some illustrious names (McNamara, Dillon, Heller) while the extensive WJC
network produced most of his from relative obscurity.
JFK came to office with little interest in domestic affairs. The only such
reference in his 1961 inaugural address were the words 'at home', inserted
at the last moment by a young aide, Harris Wofford (now the senator from
Pennsylvania). His principal concern about the civil rights 'freedom riders'
of his first year was the harm they - and less their repressors - might do
to America's image overseas. Early on, he avoided meeting black leaders.
WJC, always at ease in the company of minorities, has the self-defined
mission to set America right at home, a theme JFK never really picked up
until his third State of the Union message, mostly for electoral reasons.
Still, his language then was very much a harbinger of what WJC says today.
JFK, who never pretended to be an economist but surrounded himself with
Nobel Laureates-in-the-making, believed taxes should be cut. WJC, with at
least applied knowledge of the field but no towering intellects on board,
has come to a partly different conclusion. JFK muscled big steel into
rescinding a price increase, WJC took on big labour over Nafta. Both got
important trade legislation passed, though in JFK's days it was the Japanese
who were complaining about the US bilateral trade surplus.
Both had indifferent first years in the foreign policy arena. JFK's crosses,
mostly self-inflicted, were the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, a disastrous
first summit with Khrushchev in Vienna ('worst thing of my life; he savaged
me' was his own verdict), and the fateful first steps into the Indochina
quagmire. Only avoidance of outright conflict with the Soviet Union over the
building of the Berlin Wall was a mitigating factor, but, in 1962, the fear
of annihilation by nuclear war was real.
WJC may have inherited Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti, but he has solved none of
them and Europe has as many misgivings about him as Harold MacMillan and
Charles de Gaulle initially had about JFK. Nor does he have JFK's perennial,
but accepted, excuse of the need to fight communism. Perhaps Cuba, with
Castro near the end of his reign, will give him a victory, much as it did
JFK in the shape of the 1962 missile crisis. WJC can only hope that the
irrational Kims of North Korea do not fire off a bomb.
JFK had fewer external constraints than WJC. He could order assassinations
which worked (Vietnam's Diem) and did not (Castro), interfere in Africa and
tell off President Sukarno of Indonesia when he presented a non-aligned
report JFK did not like. The US may be the only remaining superpower, but
the CIA's hands are pretty much tied and WJC's inclinations to order foreign
leaders around are less evident, poor Mr Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan excepted.
Congress was a blight to both, in spite of nearly identical Democratic
majorities. JFK's biggest problem was with conservative southerners,
committee chairmen who simply sat on any legislation they did not like,
especially on civil rights. WJC has a moveable feast of an opposition
depending on the issue, though his first-year record with Congress,
especially after this week's Nafta triumph, is much more substantive than
JFK's.
In no areas are the differences more marked than in their relationships with
the media, even though both knew how to use television and both professed to
enjoy the company of journalists. JFK was ruthless. He socialised heavily
with the Washington big shots - Krock, Bradlee, Bartlett, Reston. They
responded by drawing a veil not only over his sexual affairs but also over
his health, which often left him a near-cripple. But he thought nothing of
ordering stories to be pulled from the New York Times nor of bugging the
media. And inexorably, to quote Richard Reeves, he directed 'their attention
away from the edges of government to the very centre' - himself.
More than that, TV transmission 30 years ago was neither instant nor
ubiquitous. It could take days for bad news to come through from Indochina
or Berlin, giving JFK precious time. Today WJC may hear about crises first
from CNN. He cannot even get a haircut, let alone go to the doctor or dine
out, without it being reported. And if he dared to lean on a newspaper to
change a story, or wiretap a reporter's phone, there would be an unholy row.
Yet he cannot reverse, much as he might like to, the focus JFK brought to
the centre.
Next week the Clintons, an hospitable if serious couple, will hold their
first formal state banquet, for the South Korean president Mr Kim Young-sam.
By November 1961, Washington was already Camelot, a city where charm, brains
and power were the indivisible triumvirate. But it was a different capital
of a different country at a different time. Only the political common
denominator remains. The two pres-idents might not want it other-wise.
