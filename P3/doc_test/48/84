MALCOLM X (15) Spike Lee
TOYS (PG) Barry Levinson
CONSENTING ADULTS (15) Alan J. Pakula
Malcolm X, Spike Lee's movie portrait of the black activist who spent 12
years firebreathing for the Nation of Islam until his assassination in 1965,
is three hours 20 minutes long. At the end we are still not sure what we are
supposed to have been watching. Propaganda? Biography? Social history?
Indignation-as-cinema?
A diffuse mixture of all four is the answer. Aiming to appeal to the widest
possible movie constituency, Lee has made the blandest possible movie. And
perhaps, once a major studio (Warner) and major star (Denzel Washington)
were involved, plus an expanding budget into which everyone from Time Warner
to the Reverend Jessie Jackson threw bundles of money, the writing was on
the wall. In the finished movie, the 'X' in Malcolm X comes to stand not for
the shock-horror lexical sign scrawled on the poster but for that
characterless all-purpose cipher we use in equations.
X for Mr Everyman. X for Take The Cardboard Political Hero You First Think
Of and then multiply by four: one for each of the serial guises Denzel
Washington adopts as we traverse the stations of the black prophet's cross.
Lee's film begins in a stylised 1940s America, with a swooping/craning
camera, a zoot-suited young hero and his pal (played by Spike Lee) and a
dance-hall scene that could have strayed in from John Waters' Hairdo. This
is a flippant and sumptuously disingenuous way to lead up to Malcolm's start
in life as a street pimp and petty crook.
Then we follow our hero into the slammer. Film noir menace; gritty
close-ups; picture of a black man hardening to the punitive reality of the
white man. The movie's third and most sustained Malcolm comes next. A
meeting with a fellow-prisoner leads him to Nation Of Islam leader Elijah
Muhammad and confirms our man in his firebrand vocation as a race-war
orator. Soon we are off into the street marches backed by inspirational
music; the streams of anti-white invective; the famously brusque response to
JFK's assassination ("The chickens have come home to roost"); and the media
Malcolm who burst into the TV and newsreel age to make the sound-bite bite.
But already, here in the film's sprawling midsection, we are hearing a
simultaneous and different sound: that of a film-maker trying to retreat at
the same time that he advances. While not overtly distorting the facts about
his hate-prophet protagonist, a Spike Lee aware of how many non-black people
he must keep from stomping from the cinema if he is to make his money back
increasingly muffles those facts. The 'chickens' quote, for example, is
hidden half-audibly inside a montage of sounds and images conveying the
post-Dallas frenzy. And the words for Malcolm's street speeches are
delivered by Denzel Washington with actorly skill rather than incendiary
elan - and are nearly all taken from his less virulent orations.
Lee, of course, could defend this blanding-out of the middle-period Malcolm
by citing the fourth and last Malcolm: the man who went to Mecca in 1964, a
year before his death, and came back a changed, more peaceable man. Plucking
a new name from the Arab thesaurus - El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz - he renounced
his separatist views. Thanks to this lucky accident of history the film can
segue its dismayingly emasculated pre-'64 Malcolm into the authentically
emasculated figure of the last year. Then it is into the Audubon Ballroom,
New York, for the glorifying martyrdom by Nation of Islam assassins.
Malcolm X achieves the remarkable feat of taking a confrontational hero and
never really confronting him. Good or evil, crackpot or calculating, Malcolm
X raised the emotional stakes of the civil rights debate. A man who made
slap-in-the-face speeches deserves a film with moments of slap-in-the-face
impact.
But Malcolm X is radical chic in the worst sense. It turns its hero into a
tie-in product of yesterday's agitprop fashions, beautified and beatified
for today by the casting of Denzel Washington. This actor has become today's
answer to Sidney Poitier: he is almost impossible to view in any light other
than Mr Nice Guy. Malcolm X should have been a questing, provocateur movie
about the limits - or non-limits - of racial indignation. It should have
kept alive the dramatic torch it lights in the inflammatory opening credits
sequence, as the American flag is cross-cut with footage of the Rodney King
beating. Instead it becomes a mixture of Black Gandhi and Guess Who's Coming
To The Assassination. The chickens, instead of coming home to roost, are
allowed to chicken out.
Toys belongs to that genre of allegorical fiction summarisable as 'All The
World's A (supply missing word)'. Where Orwell gave us the world as an
animal farm, Fritz Lang as a futuristic city, Swift as a package tour to
Parable-land, writer-director Barry Levinson opts for a toy factory. The
'Zevo Toys' plant puffs away on the skyline, like a power station built from
playblocks. Here funny-innocent Leslie Zevo (Robin Williams) and his
funny-robotic sister Alsatia (Joan Cusack) strive to carry on their
late-deceased Dad's traditions of fertile, simple-hearted inventiveness.
But lo] Trouble in Paradise. Dad, it transpires, has willed the place to
their barking mad uncle, General Michael Gambon. He - a Dr Strangelove with
extra weight and a funny accent - wants to turn Zevo Toys into Zevo Weapons.
The Oscar-nominated costumes and designs steal the show. Not only that: they
throw a honking great brick through the flimsy plot and leave a mess of
shattered ideals. Levinson nursed this pet project apparently for 12 years,
all through grown-up films like Good Morning Vietnam, Rain Man and Bugsy.
But the movie as now realised is poised between the arch and the preachy.
While the design caprices constantly bewitch our eyes - the country mansion
that opens like a picture-book, the factory wing shaped like a giant
elephant, the hilly green corridors with crossings for toy ducks - the
message delivered to our ears is less winning. It should say 'Be innocent.'
Instead, scrambled by infantilist sentimentality, it sounds more like 'Be
winsome, whimsical or retarded.'
Americans, being innocent anyway, cannot 'do' innocence. Thinking it
something separate from themselves, they caricature it. Cusack and Williams
both mug and wisecrack bravely to avert coyness - Williams alone is a
one-man Wright brothers in his bid to achieve verbal flights-of-fancy
despite the sticky terrain - but they keep seizing up in whimsy. What can a
grown actress do when required to go night-nights in a giant lacy-fringed
cradle?
Our own Mr Gambon thrives best, as the heavyweight cuckoo lumbering into the
alien nest. The Gambonic use of eyebrow and slow-cranked nasal drawl, even
the hardworking American accent (given a brief early soliloquy of comic
justification), help to give the film what it most needs: not more mercurial
comic lightness but a large chunk of deranged comic solidity.
Finally, here is a structural breakdown to assist you in enjoying Consenting
Adults. Or in deciding if you want to go at all. First part: mildly hypnotic
tale of clean-living couple (Kevin Kline, Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio) led
into criminal and sexual temptation by new neighbour and wife (Kevin Spacey,
Rebecca Miller). Second part: loony thriller in which Kline chases evil
Spacey across Carolina while the womenfolk sit around twiddling their
thumbs. Third part: end credits and dawning realisation that there were even
more holes and inanities in the plot than you first thought.
Alan J. Pakula, who once made Klute, directed. Matthew Chapman, who once
made Strangers Kiss, screenwrote. How are the mighty fallen on hard times.
