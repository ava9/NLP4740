DURING the early summer, the plains of northern India become so hot that
even a dust storm comes as a welcome relief to the villagers of Sherpur, a
hamlet in southern Rajasthan.
The powdery clouds that cover everything in a grey-brown grit obscure the
sun and, briefly, the temperature drops. Occasionally, a few drops of rain
fall, a harbinger of the monsoon which usually comes at the end of the
month.
These are the worst days of the year for Sherpur. Not only must the
villagers endure the heat and the dust, but they fret about the monsoon.
When will it arrive this year? How big will it be? Will it come at all?
Despite the government's emergency food stockpiles, a good monsoon is still
a matter of life and death in remote villages. For tens of millions of rural
Indians, including the villagers of Sherpur, good rains represent the
difference between a year of plenty, when money can be set aside for a
wedding or for a bicycle, and a year of subsistence living.
For the economy as a whole, good rains add 1 percentage point to the growth
rate; widespread drought can remove at least as much and more.
The residents of India's cities are protected from the extremes of the
weather, but they too cannot escape the effects of the monsoon. Even Bombay,
the country's most modern metropolis, is subject to the vagaries of the
weather.
Last year, the rains came so late that the city authorities started
rationing water to prevent the reservoirs running dry. Newspapers ran
stories counting down to the day the water was expected to run out. Then on
August 12 - two months late - it rained.
In 1991 there were floods. Traffic was brought to a standstill in low-lying
parts of the city. The trains stopped running as water washed over the
rails. Mr Sharad Kale, the city's commissioner, or chief executive, says:
'Bombay is built on a string of seven islands. We have filled in the gaps
but many areas lie at sea-level or below sea-level. You can imagine what
happens.'
Each day of heavy flooding costs the city millions in lost production, not
to mention the damage done to buildings and property.
d3 The Bombay Municipal Corporation is preparing a Rs60bn flood control plan
which involves rebuilding drains and sewers, some of which date back to
Victorian times. 'The trouble is,' says Mr Kale, 'people want improvements
but don't want to pay for them'.
This year's monsoon has started well, bringing good rains to farmers in
south India. Keeping to its traditional course, it moved in from the Arabian
sea into the south western tip of India in the first few days of June.
From there, it has spread, as normal across peninsula India towards the east
coast. If the usual patterns prevail, it should make a U-turn over the Bay
of Bengal and spread across northern India from the east.
However, the usual patterns do not always prevail. The difficulty of
forecasting the monsoon has exercised Indians for centuries. Astrologers,
priests, and scientists have all tried and failed to find the perfect way of
predicting the monsoon.
The burden of forecasting falls heaviest on Mr N Sen Roy, the director
general of the country's meteorological office. Mr Roy sits in front of a
computer screen covered with black and white patches superimposed on a map
of India. With it he tracks the monsoon.
'I can tell you where it is raining now,' says Mr Roy, 'but I cannot tell
you for certain where it will rain in future.' For this year, Mr Roy has
forecast a 'normal' monsoon, meaning one which brings rains of within 10 per
cent of the long-term average. If he is right, it will mean the sixth year
in succession of adequate rains.
For Mr Roy, the monsoon's scientific interest lies in its unpredictability.
He tracks 16 variables, ranging from snowfall in the Himalayas to wind
patterns in the southern Pacific.
He points to a large wooden board where the names of his predecessors are
listed, going back to 1886. His hero is Sir Gilbert Walter, who held office
from 1904 to 1924 and devised formulae which are still used today.
Mr Roy warns against reading too much into monsoon forecasts. The monsoon is
not a front, blown in from the sea, like rains from the Atlantic are in the
UK.
Such weather patterns tend to sweep across whole regions uniformly. The
monsoon is created by a complex mix of changes in air temperatures and
winds, therefore it can bring rain to one village and none at all to another
only a few miles away.
So the villagers of Sherpur can do little to protect themselves against the
vagaries of the weather. 'Rich farmers can choose which crops to sell and
which to stockpile,' says Mr Roy, 'Poor farmers have few choices.'
