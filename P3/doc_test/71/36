  [Text] During the course of successful operations, the 
areas of Arzan-Qimat, Shina, and an important hill of the rocket 
brigade have been completely cleared of the Golboddin-Dostam 
militia. Reports received by the Bakhtar Information Agency say 
that these areas were conquered by the (?Islamic army) during 
the course of today's battles. 
  Similarly, in the west of Kabul, the areas of Dasht-e 
Khairabad, the Hassan-e Gosala bridge, and Security Zone 7 have 
been captured by the forces of the Islamic State. During the 
course of the clashes, three armored vehicles and many militia 
members were taken prisoner by the mojahedin, including seven 
foreign citizens. The prisoners were captured in the Karta-e Naw 
and Bini Hesar areas.
