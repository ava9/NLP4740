  [Text] In Sheberghan and Mazar-e Sharif, the criminal 
militia's last command bases were crushed last night and today 
by the air force of the Islamic army of the country. According 
to a report by the military correspondent of Bakhtar Information 
Agency, Sheberghan's airport and command and concetration 
centers of the communist traitors were bombed by jets of the 
heroic air force of the country. As a result of the air raids, 
heavy losses have been inflicted on the criminal militia. 
  According to another report, air raids were conducted on the 
enemy's centers in Balkh Province. The report adds: Dehdadi 
airport, Qala-e Jangi, and other areas of concentration of the 
atheists and traitors were hit by the air force of the Islamic 
army of the country. As a result of the destruction of the 
fighter planes that were at the disposal of the looter militia 
and their hypocrite colleagues, the country's air space is now 
completely under the control of the air force of the Islamic 
army. It is for this reason that the last command and 
concentration centers of the enemy are being bombarded by the 
air force and are being eliminated one by one. 
  Similarly, another report says: last night, the militia, 
which has sold itself, made another failed military effort in 
the area of Pacha Pol and mounted a broad offensive against the 
positions of the Islamic army and mojahedin. Consequently, they 
confronted the resistance of islamic forces, and, having 
suffered heavy losses, they were forced to retreat. 
  By the same token, the notorious militia of Golboddin-Dostom 
yesterday mounted an offensive against the positions of the 
islamic army in the area of Bagh-e Babor, where as a result of 
the counter offensive of the Islamic army, 43 of their people 
were killed and 50 others were injured, and they eventually were 
forced to retreat. A number of foreign mercenaries are among 
the dead. The enemy's one tank was set abalze, and their two 
posts behind Gozargah electricity station were captured by the 
brave defenders of islam.
