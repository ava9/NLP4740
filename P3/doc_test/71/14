<F P=106> ["Message of gratitude" to President Borhanoddin Rabbani </F>
from Iranian President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani; date not 
given] 
  [Text] I received with great pleasure your excellency's 
message of congratulation on the occasion of the anniversary of 
the Islamic Revolution of Iran. We laid the foundation of the 
new Islamic regime on the basis of the strong faith of our 
nation and on the leadership of Grand Ayatollah Imam 
Khomeyni--the blessing of God be upon him--as well as on 
welfare, security, peace, health, and a life coupled with the 
spirituality of mankind. We have suffered many hardships in 
this respect. After a 15-year struggle, we now continue, more 
than in the past, our human and Islamic efforts in the Islamic 
Republic regime, and we have painted a very bright and dignified 
future. It is hoped that the two countries relations will 
expand further in the interest of the two nations. Expressing 
gratitude for the message sent by you, I wish from God, glorious 
is his glory, the success and health of your excellency and the 
prosperity of the Muslim Afghan nation.
