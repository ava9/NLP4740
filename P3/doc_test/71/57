  [Text] Further details have been reported on the military 
operations carried out by the Islamic Army. Quoting an official 
source in the Afghan Defense Ministry, the BAKHTAR INFORMATION 
AGENCY military correspondent reports Golboddin's militias in 
the areas around Konduz Province, along with Dostam's militias, 
resorted to an unsuccessful offensive, supported by heavy air 
bombardment and missiles attack, to disturb peace and security 
in the Konduz Province surroundings. The militias caused 
trouble to the people, plundered properties, and resorted to 
actions against our religion and traditions. The Islamic Army 
forces resorted to a retaliatory attack against the militias and 
embarked on military operations in the district of Chardara. 
During these operations, the militias were pushed back towards 
Tashghorghan from the areas of Konduz Province. The militias 
were cleared from Chardara District and the surroundings of 
Konduz. As a result of these operations, more than 100 militias 
of Golboddin-Dostam were killed, more than 120 arrested, and a 
large number injured. The enemy lost 700 pieces of light and 
heavy weapons, and two of their tanks were burned down. One 
BM-21 system and two ZK-1's also were destroyed.
