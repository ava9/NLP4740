  [Text] Air Force and artillery forces of the Islamic army 
launched aerial attacks today on the assembly centers of the 
notorious Golboddin-Dostam militia. As a result, a large number 
of militia troops were killed. 
  A responsible source of the Ministry of National Defense 
told 
a BIA military correspondent that jets of the Islamic army 
bombed enemy assembly centers in Maranjan Tapa and around 
Chelstoon, as a result of which heavy losses were inflicted on 
the enemy. 
  The spokesman added that Dostam-Golboddin militia embarked 
upon a series of movements and military transportation in the 
frontline battle zone, which were pushed back as a result of the 
activity of the Islamic army units. Their dead were left behind 
on the battlefield, and a number of their positions have been 
seized by the Islamic army. 
  A spokesman for the Kabul Garrison General Command said that 
the Golboddin-Dostam militia today fired 464 missiles at Kabul 
city residential areas. As a result of these savage missile 
attacks, a number of innocent Kabul citizens were martyred and 
wounded.
