  [Text] A report from Mazar-e Sharif says that a foreign 
country provides military supplies to Dostam's militias. 
Recently, 20 passenger aircraft delivered Kalashnikov 
ammunition and RPG-type missiles to Mazar-e Sharif airport. 
Sources close to militias say that Dostam-Golboddin's militias 
faced a shortages of arms and ammunition in the recent fighting, 
and that is why they are supplied from abroad. At the present, 
mojahedin of Balkh Province have the airport of Mazar-e Sharif 
under the pressure by heavy weapons in order to prevent the 
airport being used as a means for the continuation of 
foreigners' military interference. 
  Also, the security officials say that a system that was 
guiding the aircraft was fired at by the air forces of the 
Islamic Army in the heights of Pul-e Khomri and was destroyed. 
The destruction of this system fully paralyzes the militias air 
power. Recently, militias had used training aircraft instead of 
fighter planes, and with the destruction of this system they 
have now been deprived of this as well.
