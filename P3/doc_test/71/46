  [Text]In order to prevent the possibility of future clashes 
in the western sections of Kabul city, a peace delegation 
consisting of representatives from the Islamic State of 
Afghanistan and representative from the Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami 
of Afghanistan [Unity Party of Afghanistan] have decided to 
implement a total cease-fire as from today in the western 
sections of Kabul city. The commission supervising cease-fire 
is to control the cease-fire and make sure that the roads 
leading to the western sections of Kabul city are open. The 
agreement says that the transgressors will be questioned and 
punished. Quoting eye-witnesses, the Bakhtar Information Agency 
correspondent reports that the enforced cease-fire is being 
fully observed today and the roads leading to western section of 
Kabul are open to traffic and people. The people continue to 
commute unimpeded.
