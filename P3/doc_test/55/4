<F P=106> ["Consistent Principles and Line of WPK, Workers Party of </F>
Korea, and DPRK Government for National Reunification] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 10 (KCNA) -- The three principles 
of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity 
are the basic principles of national reunification which the 
Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the DPRK have 
consistently maintained, and reunification principles common to 
the nation which consummate the will and desire of the entire 
Korean people and which the North and the South agreed upon and 
declared at home and abroad, says NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined 
article today. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forward a proposal 
for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo, a 
proposal of reunification in the form of confederation based on 
one nation, one state, two systems and two governments, as the 
most realistic and reasonable way of achieving the independent 
and peaceful reunification of the country on the three 
principles of national reunification, the article notes, and 
goes on: 
  The proposal of reunification through confederacy based on 
one nation, one state, two systems and two governments is to 
reunify the country by founding a unified one national state 
while leaving the different systems and governments existing in 
the North and the South as they are. 
  The DPRK's proposal for reunification in the form of 
confederation is one based on national unity, placing the 
interests of the nation above anything else. 
  It is also based on the fact that two different systems and 
governments may co-exist within one national state. The 
difference in systems and ideas cannot be a condition for 
keeping one nation divided into two forever, nor can it be an 
insurmountable obstacle in reunifying the North and the South. 
The two systems can co-exist within one nation, unified one 
state when they are based on the national commonness which has 
been carried down through a five thousand year long history. 
  The DPRK's proposal for reunification through confederacy 
indicates the way of reunification on the basis of the national 
idea placing the nation above the system, and it is the most 
reasonable proposal to realise the national reunification by 
means of forming one confederal state, taking into consideration 
the unanimous demand of the people who aspire after 
reunification and the national commonness which has been formed 
for a long period, under the present conditions in which the two 
different systems exist in the North and the South. 
  No matter how the situation may change, we will make all 
efforts in the future, too, to reunify the country through 
confederacy on the three principles of independence, peaceful 
reunification and great national unity in conformity with the 
will and desire of the whole nation.
