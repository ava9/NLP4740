  [Text] President Kim Yong-sam has said that national 
reunification should not be realized under a confederalized 
system. He said it was a grave fallacy to think of confederation 
as the formula for national reunification. He made the remarks 
after receiving a briefing on the operation of a fighter wing on 
Friday as if to clamp down on the emerging argument in favor of 
a confederational system as a form of national reunification. 
He said he cannot consent to the people thinking of a 
confederation system out of an emotional yearning for national 
reunification. "We should seek a viable and sustainable formula 
for national reunification, he said. 
  Kim's remarks appear to be aimed at Kim Tae-chung, who said 
upon arrival here from his tour of the United States the 
previous day that people should be given the right to freely 
debate the national reunification issue, proposing a referendum 
on desirable unification formula. Kim Tae-chung has opted for a 
confederation system as a means of eventual national 
reunification. Meanwhile, North Korea has persistently held on 
to the confederation system for unification.
