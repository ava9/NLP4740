  [Text] Pyongyang, January 9 (KCNA) -- The Mozambique 
Liberation Front Party fully supports the principle and way of 
Korea's independent and peaceful reunification clarified by the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his New Year address for 
this year, said Feliciano Salomao Gundana, secretary general of 
the party Central Committee, when he met with the Korean 
ambassador on January 4. 
  He said Korea should be reunified by the confederacy formula 
and the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula solved through 
DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  "The United States and the South Korean authorities must 
refrain from laying obstacles in the way of Korea's 
reunification and take a sincere position and attitude towards 
the cause of reunification," he added.
