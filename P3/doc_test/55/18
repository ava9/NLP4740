<F P=106> ["S. Korea Must Rid Itself of Colonial Fetters of United </F>
States" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- If the Korean issue is 
to be settled smoothly, South Korea must rid itself of the 
fetters of U.S. colonial rule, stresses NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The paper in a by-lined article says: 
  The U.S. imperialists' occupation of South Korea and 
colonial 
rule over it are the root cause of all the misfortunes of the 
Korean nation, the chief obstacle to the reunification of Korea 
and a permanent factor of war on the Korean peninsula. The 
U.S. colonial rule over South Korea is, first of all, the source 
of the disturbance of peace, the acute confrontation and 
tensions and the growing danger of nuclear war on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  It is the invariable ambition of the U.S. imperialists to 
keep South Korea under their military occupation, execute their 
aggressive strategy toward Korea, Asia and the Pacific with it 
as the bridgehead and, further, dominate the world. 
  The United States, regarding the Korean peninsula as a "test 
field of a new military strategy," is frequently staging 
provocative nuclear attack exercises against the North together 
with the South Korean puppets, posing a constant nuclear threat 
to the DPRK. This has created a very dangerous situation which 
may lead to the outbreak of nuclear war any moment on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Yet the United States shamelessly describes South Korea as 
an 
"independent state" and "friendly nation," not its colony, and 
depicts itself as the "protector," "helper" and "apostle of 
peace" for the South Korean people. This is a ridiculous 
sophism to conceal the colonial dependence of South Korea and 
its own nature as an aggressor, a plunderer and the chieftain of 
war. 
  The U.S. colonial rule over South Korea is also the chief 
obstacle to the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. 
  It is entirely due to the United States that the Korean 
nation's cause of reunification has not yet been accomplished. 
  It is the United States that has manipulated the puppets to 
bind to the chains of fascism the South Korean students and 
people who desire reunification through the alliance with 
communism and the North. It is also the United States that has 
worked out a divisive scenario for the puppets and manipulated 
them to blindly oppose the reasonable proposals of the North for 
national reunification. 
  The United States must show its will to solve the Korean 
issue by putting an end to its anachronistic military occupation 
of South Korea and colonial rule over it.
