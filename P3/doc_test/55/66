<F P=106> ["All Matters Must Be Solved on Principle of National </F>
Independence"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 28 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comes out with a by-lined article calling for solving all 
matters for national reunification on the principle of national 
independence. 
  Noting that to adhere to the principle of national 
independence is an urgent demand for removing the danger of war 
created on the Korean peninsula and defending the exisoence of 
the nation, the article says: 
  Keeping to the principle of national independence 
constitutes 
the starting point in achieving national reunification, the long 
cherished desire of the fellow countrymen, and establishing 
sovereignty of the nation throughout the country. 
  Outside forces which divided our country will never make a 
present of reunification to our people. 
  If some forces intend to attain a sinister aim in reliance 
on 
the strength of outside forces, negating the principle of 
national independence, it may cause grave consequences of 
victimizing the whole nation at the hands of outside forces. 
  The reunification our nation wants is one to realize the 
independence of the nation, not one to live, shackled to others. 
  The principle of national independence should be thoroughly 
observed to realize the cause of national reunification in 
conformity with the interests and demand of our nation. 
  It is a lesson of history that if one depends on foreign 
forces and their interference is allowed, he will find himself 
in a miserable position in which he is compelled to study the 
pleasure of foreign forces even at the place of North-South 
dialogue and can not do anything for the nation, restricted by 
foreign forces. 
  Anyone who wants to establish the sovereignty of the nation 
throughout the country by reunifying the country must naturally 
take the patriotic stand of demolishing the wall of division, 
joining hands with the fellow countrymen on the principle of 
national independence. 
  Of importance at present in applying the principle of 
national independence is to thoroughly reject the idea of 
dependence on foreign forces, take the position of national 
independence and rely on the forces of national independence, 
not depending on outside forces. 
  Dependence on foreign forces is the road to division, war 
and 
national ruin, and only national independence is the road to 
reunification, peace and prosperity. 
  If the North and the South achieve peace and reunification 
by 
joining hands with each other, firmly adhering to the principle 
of national independence, the dignity and might of a reunified 
Korea will shine brilliantly all over the world.
