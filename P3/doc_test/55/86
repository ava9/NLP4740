  [Text] Pyongyang, January 27 (KCNA) -- The North side 
headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for 
the Country's Reunification (Pomchonghaknyon) issued a statement 
Wednesday denouncing the South Korean authorities for blocking 
the Seoul trip of the mourners' group of the North side for the 
funeral of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a patriotic champion of 
reunification. 
  The statement scathingly denounces the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam's 
fascist step as an intolerable insult to the patriotic spirit of 
Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a grave infringement on the compatriotic 
feelings of the entire youth and students and people in the 
North and a total denial of ethics and morality. 
  The statement says: 
  "It is outrageous of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique to talk 
about `organisation benefiting the enemy' and `nuclear issue' 
for justifying their act this time. 
  "Denying the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon) means denying great unity of the 
nation, and the latter means denying national reunification. 
  "The entire youth and students in the northern half of the 
country will become flames burning injustice and immorality and 
standard-bearers of great national unity, punish the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet clique seeking a way out in dependence on 
outside forces and North-South confrontation and achieve 
national reunification which was the lifelong wish of Rev. Mun 
Ik-hwan, a patriotic martyr for reunification, rallied around 
Pomchonghaknyon, the vanguard of Pomminnyon."
