  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 (KNS-KCNA) -- Han Tok-su, chairman of 
the Central Standing Committee of the General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), supported the appeal 
published by the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for 
the Reunification of the Fatherland [DFRF] as regards the 
exposure of the Korean peninsula and the Korean nation to the 
grave danger of nuclear war caused by the criminal acts of the 
U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique. 
  The appeal dated March 29 called on the Koreans in the 
North, 
South and overseas to turn out in the struggle to remove the 
danger of nuclear war and pave the way for peace and 
reunification of the country. 
  Han Tok-su in a statement March 31 said if the nuclear war 
provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
puppet clique are tolerated, the whole territory of Korea will 
be laid waste and the Korean nation with a long history of five 
thousand years will suffer an irrevocable nuclear disaster in 
the present era. 
  He urged the Japanese authorities to refrain from joining in 
the war provocation moves of the United States and the 
anti-national acts of the South Korean authorities, renounce the 
hostile policy toward the DPRK and immediately give up the 
repressive scheme against Chongnyon and the Koreans in Japan. 
  He called on the compatriots under the influence of the "ROK 
Residents Association in Japan" to reject the treacherous forces 
and outside forces and join Chongnyon on the patriotic road, 
irrespective of ism and affiliation. 
  "We will firmly unite with the compatriots in the North, 
South and overseas under the banner of `10-point programme of 
the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the 
country', a great charter of national unity, and more vigorously 
fight to remove the danger of war and pave the way for peace and 
reunification of the country," Han Tok-su stated.
