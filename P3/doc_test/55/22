  [Text] Pyongyang, February 7 (KCNA) -- The obstacle lying 
in the way of reunification at present is the anti-national 
separatist Kim Yong-sam regime, says NODONG SINMUN in a signed 
article today. 
  Stressing that this regime must be toppled, it says: 
  The record of nearly one year after the appearance of the 
present regime in South Korea proves in stark reality that the 
Kim Yong-sam group is the heinous enemy of national 
reunification. 
  In his "inaugural address" the traitor Kim Yong-sam waxed 
eloquent about "the priority of the nation." But, in no time, he 
resumed the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises, which had 
been suspended toward the end of the "Sixth Republic Regime", 
against the North in league with outside forces and drove the 
North-South relations into a dangerous phase under the pretext 
of North's "nuclear problem." The puppets intercepted a letter 
containing the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole 
nation sent by the North to the South Korean authorities and 
representatives of different political parties, organisations 
and public figures and even totally rejected the North's 
proposal for the exchange of special envoys. 
  After taking office the traitor Kim Yong-sam has utterly 
ignored the reunification question and repeated the trite 
"stage-by-stage" doctrine of the preceding dictators. 
  In his "New Year address" and "New Year press conference", 
he 
did not utter even a word about reunification but spun out trash 
decrying the North and getting on its nerve. From this we can 
foresee that the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime will work viciously 
to aggravate the North-South relations and block reunification 
this year, too. 
  If the cause of national reunification is to be promoted, a 
powerful force for reunification must be built up and, at the 
same time, the force obstructive to reunification must be 
decisively removed. The movement for independence, democracy 
and reunification must be developed to a new, higher stage in 
South Korea to topple the Kim Yong-sam "civilian" fascist 
dictatorship.
