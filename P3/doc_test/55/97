<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Anti-dialogue, Antireunification </F>
Confrontation Commotions Are Being Perpetrated More Viciously"] 
  [Text] With the beginning of the new year, the Kim 
Yong-sam group's anti-dialogue and antireunification 
confrontation commotions have been perpetrated more viciously. 
  As was already reported, the South Korean ruling bunch 
blocked the visit to Seoul by our side's delegation of 
condolence to attend the funeral service for Rev. Mun Ik-hwan. 
In addition, it frustrated the Panmunjom contact between the 
Chondoist delegates of the North and the South to jointly 
commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Kabo farmers war, thus 
blocking the joint commemoration of the anniversary by the North 
and the South. 
  On 17 January, the South Korean ruling bunch arrested and 
imprisoned in the fascist prison Ho Hyun-chong, senior in 
Chonbuk University in South Korea, on the charge of violation of 
the notorious National Security Law, claiming that he had 
dialogue through international telephone line with the delegates 
of the North during the first conference of joint chairmen of 
the National Alliance of Youth and Students for National 
Reunification [Pomchonghangnyon] last year in the capacity of 
South side's vice chairman of Pomchonghangnyon. 
  Some time ago, the puppet district court in Kwangju staged a 
court trial for five Chonnam University students who studied and 
researched the immortal chuche idea, and sentenced all of them 
to prison terms. 
  The North-South confrontation commotions and cruel 
oppression 
of democratic reunification forces which have been perpetrated 
by the Kim Yong-sam group more viciously with the beginning of 
the new year fully revealed its antinational and 
antireunification traitorous color. 
  By blocking our side's delegation of condolence which wanted 
to visit Seoul to attend the funeral ceremony of Rev. Mun 
Ik-hwan, the Kim Yong-sam group exposed itself as the group of 
peerless traitors and separatists who totally discarded 
conscience and essential etiquette and morality as a human 
being, being engrossed with commotions on division and 
confrontation. 
  Besides, the Kim Yong-sam group blocked the joint 
commemoration of the events marking the 100th anniversary of 
Kabo farmers war, which was carried out to safeguard the 
national spirit under the ideal of rejecting foreign aggressors 
and promoting the people's welfare by defending the country. 
Thus, the Kim Yong-sam group showed its true color as the group 
of antinational ill-bred hooligans who disgraced our forefathers. 
  Those who cruelly oppressed the innocent youth, students and 
people, who called for national reunification, at the point of 
guns and bayonets cannot have any intent for reunification. 
  The puppets are, in actuality, running wild in an attempt to 
crush us in collusion with outside forces on a pretext of 
suspicion of nuclear arms development by the North. They are 
trying to stage large-scale exercise of a northward war of 
aggression, including the Team Spirit joint military exercise, 
together with outside forces, thus aggravating tension of the 
nation to an extreme pitch. They are bringing dark clouds of 
nuclear war over the heads of fellow countrymen and viciously 
maneuvering to realize the international cooperation system and 
so-called sanctions against us by clinging to sleeves of outside 
forces. 
  They even opened rice markets in South Korea in an attempt 
to 
block third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. Moreover, they begged 
outside forces to set up an international cooperation system in 
an attempt to oppose our package solution plan for the 
resolution of the nuclear problem. 
  The vicious maneuvers of the Kim Yong-sam group to aggravate 
North-South relations and to block the road to reunification 
evoked indignation of fellow countrymen who want reunification. 
  It is unanimous intent of the South Korean people that the 
Kim Yong-sm separatist regime must be overthrown in order to 
achieve national reconciliation, unity and reunification that 
all fellow countrymen are aspiring to. 
  The South Korean people, who cannot live without 
reunification, absolutely will not tolerate the Kim Yong-sam 
group, the most vicious enemy of reunification who is 
frantically running amok to block the national reunification 
under the veil of civilian government.
