<F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Challenge to the Aspiration </F>
for Reunification"] 
  [Text] The Kim Yong-sam ring's fascist oppression maneuvers 
become more vicious as the days go by. 
  According to Seoul radio, on 17 January the Seoul Police 
Administration arrested Ho Hyon-chun, a senior at the Chonbuk 
University, who was involved in the August 1993 Pan-National 
Rally as vice chairman of the South side's Headquarters of the 
National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's 
Reunification [Pomchonghangnyon], and took him into custody on 
charges of violating the National Security Law. 
  Student Ho Hyon-chun was wanted by the puppet police on the 
charge of attempting to make a telephone call to a 
representative of the Korean Student Council of the northern 
half of the Republic, who was in Beijing, China, during the 
inauguration ceremony of the Korea Federation of University 
Student Councils held at the Koryo University last 28 May. 
  The puppet police arrested the vice chairman of the South 
side's Pomchonghangnyon Headquarters at a time when the 
aspiration for the fatherland's reunification has been 
increasing among fellow countrymen in the North, the South, and 
overseas since the beginning of the new year. This is a vicious 
challenge to the fellow countrymen's aspiration for 
reunification as well as an open fascist oppression of South 
Korean youth and students' rightful struggle for the 
fatherland's reunification and has caused a burning national 
indignation. 
  As everyone knows, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
taught in his historical New Year's address that all Korean 
compatriots in the North, the South, and overseas should open a 
new phase of the fatherland's reunification this year by 
carrying out a nationwide struggle, united in one under the 
banner of the great unity of the whole nation. 
  Greatly encouraged by the great leader's New Year's address, 
the people in the northern half of the Republic have been 
vigorously carrying out the struggle for socialist construction 
and for the fatherland's reunification since the beginning of 
the new year. The South Korean people and overseas compatriots 
are also actively struggling to achieve the reunification in the 
nineties, with a new aspiration for the fatherland's 
reunification. 
  Reflecting this trend of the time, the South Korean 
Democratic Party leader Yi Ki-taek held a New Year's news 
conference and expressed his concern about the current 
South-North relations and his willingness to visit Pyongyang and 
meet the great leader in order to improve the deadlocked 
South-North relations. Yang Hyong- sop, chairman of the DPRK 
Supreme People's Assembly, supported and welcomed Yi's 
willingness to visit Pyongyang, saying it is a natural 
expression of intense patriotism by a person who is concerned 
about the destiny of the country and the nation. 
  Now is the time for all fellow countrymen in the North, the 
South, and overseas to launch into the struggle to achieve the 
great national unity after overcoming ideological and systemic 
differences. At this time, the South Korean puppets put a South 
Korean student on the wanted list and finally arrested him 
simply because he had attempted a telephone call to the North's 
youth and students. This was like throwing cold water on the 
South Korean students' and people's fervent aspiration for the 
fatherland's reunification, and clearly showed the rascals' real 
nature as the enemy of the reunification and fascist tyrants who 
does not have the slightest will for reunification. 
  If the Kim Yong-sam ring really practiced civilian politics, 
which they have noisily been advertising, how on earth could 
they consider it a crime to attempt a telephone call to the 
North's students for the fatherland's reunification that all 
fellow countrymen earnestly desire and could they impute an 
awful charge of violation of the National Security Law on him. 
  This act can be done only by those who pursue a permanent 
division of the country, not its reunification; and national 
confrontation, not its unity. In fact, the Kim Yong-sam ring 
has not abolished the fascist evil laws and suppressive 
organizations, such as the National Security Law and the Agency 
of National Security Planning, while talking about reform. They 
use them rather rashly to brutally oppress the South Korean 
people's struggle for independence, democracy, and reunification. 
  Their ignorant and cruel fascist oppression maneuver of 
considering it a crime to attempt to make a telephone call to 
youth and students in the northern half of the Republic and of 
punishing it shows that it is impossible for the South Korean 
youth, students, and people to enjoy their democratic freedom, 
to exercise their right to democracy, or even to discuss with 
fellow countrymen over the reunification issue while leaving the 
ring of civilian dictator Kim Yong-sam and the National Security 
Law, a vicious fascist evil law and anti-reunification law, as 
they are. 
  If the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique believes that they can 
break the people's will for reunification by oppressing the 
South Korean students' reunification movement, they are making a 
wrong assumption. 
  The fatherland's reunification is the national task that 
cannot be delayed any further and the South Korean people's 
struggle for it is intensified more than ever. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring should look straight at the 
development 
of the situation in South Korea, act discreetly, and resign from 
power immediately.
