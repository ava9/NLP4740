  [Text] Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- Mozambican President 
Joaquim Alberto Chissano received a Korean Agro-Technicians 
Cooperation delegation on January 3 and said there is no change 
in Mozambique's principled stand of supporting Korea's 
reunification. 
  Noting that the new year address of the great comrade 
President Kim Il-song indicates in detail the way of building 
socialism and reunifying Korea, he said Mozambique holds that 
Korea should be reunified according to the confederacy formula 
and 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation 
advanced by the president. 
  There is no other way but to carry the confederacy formula 
into effect for the reunification of Korea, he stressed, adding 
that the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula must be solved 
through DPRK- USA talks.
