  [Text] Pyongyang, January 18 (KCNA) -- The New Year address 
of the great leader President Kim Il-song has evoked great 
repercussions among South Korean people of all walks of life, 
according to Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation [VNS]. 
  Choe Ung-mo, an ex-journalist in Chongno District, Seoul, 
said the New Year address of respected President Kim Il-song 
gives a new hope and confidence to the people in the South who 
are yearning after the North under the politics centring on the 
masses as a beacon of hope. 
  The group of traitors is resorting to vicious slanders and 
smear propaganda against the North in a bid to stop the minds of 
the people in the South from turning toward the North, but the 
people in the South stubbornly fight for the day when they will 
live under the administration of the president, looking up to 
the North, an earthly paradise of the working people, as a 
beacon of hope, he added. 
  Yi Myong-chol, a peasant in Puchon, pointed out that the 
peasants in the South failed in farming because of man-made 
calamities and, still worse, had to give up farming because the 
"president" opened rice market to the Yankees. 
  I heard the news that last year a bumper harvest visited the 
North under the sagacious agricultural policy of President Kim 
Il-song and, no doubt, this year, too, a bumper harvest will 
visit the North thanks to the agriculture-first policy set forth 
by the president, he noted, adding that the earnest wish of the 
peasants in the South is to do farming to their heart's content 
under the care of respected President Kim Il-song who is 
pursuing the best agricultural policy in the world. 
  A dissident Yi Sang-o in Kwangju said the proposal for 
achieving reunification by means of confederacy reclarified by 
President Kim Il-song in his New Year address is a banner for 
the reunification movement that the Korean nation should hold 
aloft. 
  There is no alternative but reunification by means of 
confederacy, the way of reunification which is acceptable to 
anyone under the present situation in Korea and this formula of 
reunification is the most fair and aboveboard and most 
realistic, best one, he said. 
  He vowed to devote his wisdom and energies to the struggle 
to 
reunify the country by means of confederacy as taught by 
President Kim Il-song.
