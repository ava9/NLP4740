<F P=106> [Statement issued by the spokesman of the Committee for the </F>
Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in Pyongyang on 22 
March] 
  [Text] The spokesman of the Committee for the Peaceful 
Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] issued the following 
statement denouncing the South Korean authorities for moving 
toward confrontation and war, totally blocking the exchange of 
top-level special envoys and dialogue between the North and the 
South. 
  Statement by the spokesman of the CPRF: 
  Currently, the South Korean authorities are moving toward 
the 
road of confrontation and war by totally blocking the exchange 
of top-level special envoys and dialogue between the North and 
the South. 
  As is already known, at the threshold the eighth 
working-level delegates contact for the exchange of special 
envoys held on 19 March, at a high-level strategic meeting, the 
South Korean authorities talked about some kind of strong 
measure and babbled about the resumption of the Team Spirit 
nuclear war exercise, bringing in Patriot missiles, and taking 
part in international sanctions. Such provocative action by the 
South Korean authorities already predicted the destiny of the 
exchange of special envoys and the harassment of peace. Today's 
situation has taken that course. 
  At the 19 March working-level delegates contact, the South 
side took a position of virtually declaring separation from us, 
thus bringing the working-level delegates contact itself to a 
rupture, and it is now driving the situation on the Korean 
peninsula to an acute phase of war. 
  The provocative steps taken at the so-called meeting of 
security-related ministers on 21 March was a sort of a 
declaration of total confrontation and a declaration of war 
against us. 
  Right after this reckless provocative declaration by the 
puppet rulers, the puppet forces entered into an emergency alert 
in South Korea and there are signs of moves to bring in new 
military equipment, including Patriot missiles from the United 
States. 
  The CPRF resolutely denounces in the name of the entire 
Korean people the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique for unilaterally 
breaking up the dialogue with fellow countrymen and pushing the 
country's situation to a very dangerous brink of war by 
following outside forces. 
  All of today's situation clearly shows that, from the very 
beginning, the South Korean rulers did not want peace and 
peaceful reunification of the country, not to speak of the 
exchange of special envoys, but used the North-South dialogue 
for their insidious aim of putting the brakes on the DPRK-U.S. 
talks. 
  The reality in which the country's situation is rushing to a 
new phase of war urges the whole nation to see with high 
consciousness what a grave situation has been caused by the 
criminal acts of the Kim Yong-sam ring in abandoning the 
North-South dialogue and obstructing the DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  Facts show that the North and the South may fall victim to 
outside forces, failing to achieve reconciliation and 
reunification, while such flunkeyist nation-sellers and national 
traitors as the Kim Yong-sam ring are left alone in the country, 
the traitors who set greater store by the interests of outside 
forces than by the nation's security and interests and think 
more of their personal comfort and distinction than of the 
nation's destiny. 
  Now, the Kim Yong-sam ring has become unable to conceal the 
fact that it is an antinational group that blocks dialogue 
between the fellow countrymen and seeks to inflict the scourge 
of war upon the nation, keeping outside forces within the 
country. The national traitors must be removed and liquidated 
within the nation as early as possible. 
  As long as the South Korean people already judged that there 
is nothing more to expect from the Kim Yong-sam fascist 
nation-selling regime, we will carry out a resolute struggle to 
eliminate the nation-sellers in the hope of promoting 
reconciliation and unity between the North and the South and 
open the road for the country's peace and peaceful reunification.
