  [Text] Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- The preparatory 
committee for the formation of the South side headquarters of 
the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification 
(Pomminnyon) in an article contributed to its organ "Materials 
of Pomminnyon" called for an extensive struggle to open a new 
horizon of reunification. 
  The article titled "For Setting Correct Orientation of 
National Reunification Movement at Present" analysed the world 
situation and the tense situation on the Korean peninsula and 
said "the situation calls for firmly upholding the banner of 
national independence and great national unity". 
  What is decisive in forcing the way through this situation 
is 
always the internal factor, the article said, adding: 
  Under the grave situation as today, the independent forces 
of 
the whole nation must unite more closely under the banner of 
independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity 
and thus decisively frustrate the national splittist moves of 
the outside forces, the United States and Japan, and make active 
efforts to greet the independent reunification in 1995. 
  Turning to the key points of the reunification movement in 
South Korea at present, the article pointed out that they must 
be "rejection of the outside forces, the United States and 
Japan, implementation of the North-South agreement and 
attainment of reunification in the form of confederation." The 
outside forces obstructing the implementation of the 
inter-Korean agreement must be glaringly exposed, the article 
added. 
  It continued: 
  The proposal for reunification through confederacy 
epitomized 
in the words of one nation, one state, two systems and two 
governments is the only reunification formula. Efforts to 
attain a national agreement on this most reasonable proposal are 
an immediate task the fulfilment of which brooks no further 
delay. 
  Clarifying the main tasks of the present national 
reunification movement -- "rejection of the outside forces, the 
U.S. and Japan, implementation of the inter-Korean agreement 
and reunification through confederacy," -- the article called 
for redoubled efforts to open a new horizon of reunification.
