<F P=106> ["Vice-President Kim Pyong-sik on Principled Stand for </F>
National Reunification" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 5 (KCNA) -- The principled stand 
regarding national reunification clarified by the respected 
leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year address serves as a 
banner inspiring the whole nation to accomplish the cause of 
reunification in the 90s, tiding over difficulties in the way of 
the nation, said Kim Pyong-sik, vice-president of the DPRK and 
chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Social 
Democratic Party, in his statement to the press on January 4. 
  He said that the great leader in his New Year address 
pointed 
out that in future, too, the government of the DPRK would make 
every effort to reunify the country in the form of confederation 
which is based on one nation, one state, two systems and two 
governments, in accordance with the three principles of 
independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity. 
  He said that all the compatriots in the North, South and 
abroad should turn out as one man to establish a unified 
confederal state, closely united in one mind, transcending the 
differences in ideology, ideal and political view and religious 
belief under the banner of the 10-point program of the great 
unity of the whole nation. 
  Noting that the respected leader President Kim Il-song in 
the 
New Year address expounded the principled stand of the 
government of the DPRK that the nuclear problem on the Korean 
peninsula should be settled through the DPRK-U.S. talks, he said 
that the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula should be 
solved through negotiation between the United States which 
introduced nuclear weapons and the DPRK exposed to its potential 
threat and the United States must know that it will get nothing 
from resorting to pressure and threat. 
  The entire members of the Korean Social Democratic Party in 
hearty response to the New Year address of the great leader 
President Kim Il-song would make all efforts to achieve 
reunification in the 90s by great national unity, he declared.
