  [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- Eleven political figures 
of foreign countries including the Politburo member of the C.C. 
[Central Committee], the Communist Party of Argentina, Jorge 
Alberto Craines, and the coordinator of the People's Party of 
Costa Rica, Eduardo Mora Valverde, in a joint statement 
published on May 22 held that for a durable peace and security 
of the Korean peninsula the Korean Armistice Agreement should be 
replaced by a peace agreement. 
  Recalling that the United States has broken down the third 
round of DPRK-U.S. talks and shipped various kinds of 
sophisticated weapons including Patriot missiles into South 
Korea recently, he joint statement said this shows that the 
United States is driving the situation on the Korean peninsula 
to the brink of war. 
  It expressed support for the Korean people's efforts to 
solve 
the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula in a peaceful way 
through DPRK-U.S. talks, and strongly urged the United States 
to get its forces out of South Korea. 
  It expressed the belief that the Korean people would surely 
achieve national reunification in accordance with the three 
principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great 
national unity laid down by President Kim Il-song.
