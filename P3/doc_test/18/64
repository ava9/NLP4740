polls, Jurek Martin looks at the collapse of morale in the Bush camp

What a difference a week can make in politics. Seven days ago, a successful
Democratic party convention in New York could not dispel the prevalent sense
that this presidential election was still as much George Bush's to lose as
it was Bill Clinton's to win. Now the feeling is that the governor of
Arkansas is going to have to screw things up very badly (or be screwed by a
ruthless negative campaign) not to end up in the White House.
Three factors lie behind the changed perception. First, the polls put Mr
Clinton 20-30 points ahead of Mr Bush nationally, the biggest convention
'bounce' in history. They show that supporters of Ross Perot, the defunct
independent candidate, much prefer Mr Clinton's newly refined semi-populist
message of change. Some state surveys now find Mr Bush weaker than
anticipated west of the Mississippi, where he stood to gain most from Mr
Perot's withdrawal.
Second, Mr Clinton and Senator Al Gore, his running mate, embarked on a
1,000-mile bus odyssey through small towns from New York to St Louis that
drew fabulous crowds and rave political reviews. The ticket looked sharp,
impressive in its youthful energy, consistent in its themes.
Comparisons were drawn with Harry Truman's 'whistle stop' train tours of
1948 by those not old enough to remember them.
But finally, and potentially far exceeding any ephemeral qualities in the
first two, Bush had a truly terrible week, unsure of himself and looking
ratty and his age. The return of James Baker from the State Department to
run the White House and the campaign next month was suddenly seen not merely
as desirable but as the last, perhaps only, hope of salvaging re-election.
As pundit after pundit pontificated, the problem was no longer
Vice-President Dan Quayle (though he is not an asset when matched against Mr
Gore), no longer the faltering economy (though, as Alan Greenspan, the Fed's
chairman, implied, it is unlikely to come good enough to benefit Mr Bush
greatly by November), no longer the defiance of Saddam Hussein or the
tragedy of what was Yugoslavia (though both undermine the president's record
in foreign policy). The problem, put simply, is George Bush himself.
He did campaign this week, contrary to his promise to keep his powder dry
until the convention in Houston next month. Two excursions were disastrous.
In New Jersey, he got plain wrong his own education grant proposal for the
less well-off; in a Washington suburb he was impaled, in front of the
cameras, by a local teacher complaining of his distortions of traditional
family values.
He had a crack at Mr Clinton's economic policies, which should have been
fruitful because it is not clear how his opponent would simultaneously
finance his investment programme and reduce the budget deficit. But Mr Bush
could only warn yet again of the dangers of 'liberal' and 'tax and spend'
Democrats running the country.
That worked in the Reagan campaigns and still had mileage in 1988. But the
economy is now Mr Bush's responsibility and sloughing the blame for its
plight on congressional Democrats does not suggest a way out of the impasse.
Ross Perot is not the only American to believe it would help to have the
president and the Congress working together for a change - and it is a stone
cold certainty that the Democrats will still be running Capitol Hill after
November.
Other atmospherics around the president were also depressed. The White House
had to fight off endless rumours that Mr Bush was unwell (or that Barbara
Bush or Marilyn Quayle were ailing.) Some Republicans in Congress, led by
the acerbic Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming, said they might not even go to
Houston. Jack Kemp, the housing secretary and once again, with the Los
Angeles riots a fading memory, semi-detached from the government, let it be
known that he was proposing to be in Colorado since no speaking slot had
been assigned to him.
The 'dump Quayle' movement, possibly artfully stoked from a distance by Mr
Baker, gathered such force that Mr Bush was obliged to state that his
vice-president's future was 'certain,' whatever that meant, and Mr Quayle to
declare that he would step aside if he thought he was hurting his president.
He may have then done precisely that by getting into a public disagreement
with his wife over what to advise their daughter if she were unmarried and
pregnant. Mr Quayle, sounding like a father and not an anti-abortion zealot,
said he would support any decision she took; Mrs Quayle, who has strong
opinions on many things, stated flatly any baby would be carried to term.
Even Mr Clinton sounded sorry for the vice-president.
But to dispose of him for anyone other than General Colin Powell, chairman
of the joint chiefs and, never forget, a black, would smack of desperation.
Other good candidates exist - Dick Cheney, the secretary of defence, Senator
Phil Gramm of Texas, Governor Pete Wilson of California, even, improbably,
Mr Kemp - but all are potential rivals of Mr Baker, whose own longer-term
ambitions can probably best be served by the return of Mr Bush and Mr Quayle
in tandem, unless he runs the campaign himself from second slot on the
ticket. But this would make Mr Bush too obviously a puppet and is probably
too crude a ploy for a man of Mr Baker's sophistication.
Foreign policy offered no relief, apart from Mr Baker's satisfactory
sessions in Israel. Saddam Hussein presents Mr Bush with a very real
dilemma. Military action against Iraq might be seen as too transparent an
attempt to boost domestic political popularity, whereas failure to do so
could be taken as a further abdication of US leadership. The fear of
Americans coming home in body bags or civilian targets bombed in error is
also real.
Mr Clinton's own warning to Saddam Hussein was both statesmanlike and
designed to minimise any advantages accruing to Mr Bush should air strikes
be launched. He was also quick to insert the knife with his comment that the
imminent transfer of Mr Baker ('the best we've got') showed that Mr Bush
cared less about foreign policy than about re-election.
Mr Baker is also not inheriting the best campaign team in the business. Lee
Atwater, the hard-nosed tactical foil to his own strategic sense in 1988, is
dead. Sam Skinner is considered to be out of his political depth as White
House chief of staff: Rich Bond, Republican party chairman, compares poorly
with Ron Brown, his Democratic counterpart; Clayton Yuetter, domestic policy
adviser, still has his heart more in trade and agriculture; Robert Teeter,
nominal co-chairman with Mr Skinner, is perhaps too easy with Bush.
It goes beyond mere personalities. The Quayle team of conservatives is never
averse to leaking its disaffected thoughts to the media, while others in the
Republican party are pursuing separate agendas, including their own
re-elections. The calls this week for Mr Bush to ditch his economic policy
team - Nicholas Brady, the treasury secretary, and Richard Darman, the
budget director - came from one, or both, of these quarters.
Thus Mr Baker has to impose order where it is lacking. But mostly he somehow
has to take Mr Bush in hand and give shape and purpose to his re-election
effort. The way things went this week, he will find the Middle East a
cakewalk in comparison.
