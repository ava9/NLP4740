UNITED Nations officials considering new relief measures for Somalia have
been warned that large-scale US intervention could jeopardise aid workers in
the country.
Aid organisations battling against Somalia's famine have prepared evacuation
plans, fearing reports that large-scale US military intervention will make
foreign staff targets of Somali gunmen seeking hostages.
Virtually all relief organisations have said they would pull out of Somalia
while troop deployment took place to avoid the risk of being attacked by
racketeers, who are angry at losing their grip on the 'aid business'.
The White House confirmed on Friday that the US administration had concluded
that 'some form of military activity' involving US troops was the only way
to assure the security of relief supplies to Somalia.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the spokesman, said in Maine, where President George
Bush is on vacation, that it was premature to speculate on troop deployments
at this stage. Critical decisions have first to be reached in the United
Nations Security Council, which has been holding meetings to discuss a
Somali operation.
Somalia's two main warlords have cautiously welcomed reports of the US offer
to help the UN protect food convoys and ensure aid reaches the needy.
However aid workers with long experience of Somalia are sure armed gangs,
only loosely controlled by warlords, would attack UN troops.
Washington is aware of the relief agencies' concerns that their staff in
Somalia may be placed at greater risk by even the talk of outside military
intervention.
However, it has concluded that the alternative would be to invite even
greater criticism that it is doing nothing to prevent the humanitarian
catastrophe.
There has been a fundamental shift in the Defence Department's previously
firmly held view that Somalia was unpropitious territory for the engagement
of US forces.
At a National Security Council meeting last Wednesday, neither Mr Dick
Cheney, defence secretary, nor Gen Colin Powell, chairman of the joint
chiefs of staff, raised objections to the State Department proposal that as
many as 30,000 US troops be offered to a UN force.
However this force is composed, the US military still wants to ensure that
its contingent remains under US command. This reflects its new belief that
looters controlled by various Somali warlords do not pose a serious military
threat.
Mr Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, briefed
President-elect Bill Clinton last week on the new US approach and reported
that Mr Clinton fully supported greater US engagement.
Mr Larry Eagleburger, acting secretary of state, has been in touch with
governments in Europe and in the region, to drum up support for
intervention. The case for this has grown stronger with the presentation of
evidence that as much as 70 per cent of the international relief supplies
reaching Somalia have been purloined and redirected to the broader African
black market in food.
