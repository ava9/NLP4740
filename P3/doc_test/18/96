<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, providing the first public signal of the Bush 
Administration's priorities in an age of shrinking defense budgets, said Friday 
that the United States must preserve its naval supremacy and modernize its 
strategic nuclear weapons. Implicitly, that could put the burden of budget 
cutting primarily on the Army. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that the role of U.S. ground forces in Europe is "up for grabs," 
Cheney suggested in an interview with The Times that the task of maintaining 
ground forces on the continent could be left to the NATO allies. 
</P>
<P>
He called his comments "a reflection of the strategic situation: We are the 
major maritime power, just like the Soviets are a major land-based power." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's remarks came a day after President Bush, in an interview with a group 
of foreign reporters, said the United States will consider reducing its troop 
strength abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a rapidity of change around the world . . . " Bush said. "I'm not 
suggesting that forevermore we'll have the same level of troops anywhere -- 
standing army, Europe, Korea, anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Bush added that the United States is "certainly . . . not going to take 
unilateral action" in withdrawing troops or equipment from the soil of such 
longstanding allies. The transcript of the interview was released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, who also stressed that the United States would not act unilaterally in 
revising the NATO balance, said one possible future for NATO would give 
Washington's North Atlantic allies the principal role in defending European 
soil, while the United States would boost naval and air forces in the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"Should the U.S., as some have suggested, take on a role that emphasizes more 
heavily the U.S. obligation in the naval area and in air supremacy and places a 
greater emphasis with our allies in terms of the ground combat role in Europe?" 
posed Cheney. "All of those issues it seems to me are up for grabs." 
</P>
<P>
At a later point in the interview, he said: "The U.S. is now and will want to 
continue to be the pre-eminent naval power in the world," even as cuts are made 
in the overall defense budget. In addition, he said that "we're going to want 
to preserve our strategic nuclear capability," adding finally that the 
preservation of adequate conventional forces would be another demand. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's views are consistent with those of many lawmakers and defense 
analysts, who have said that as budgets shrink and the Soviet military threat 
to Western Europe diminishes, the United States may plot a return to an 
American reliance on highly mobile naval forces, which are useful in Third 
World brush fires, and on nuclear systems, which are relatively inexpensive to 
build and operate. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, analysts have widely predicted that the United States would 
scale back the large and costly land armies it has maintained in Europe since 
the onset of the Cold War -- the same prospect raised by the President. 
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary's comments came as the Pentagon entered a third week of 
what he called a "fascinating" period of budget review. The contingency plans 
ordered by Cheney on Nov. 13 anticipate as much as $200 billion being cut from 
the Pentagon's budget blueprint for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
By ordering the sweeping budget review, Cheney said Friday he hopes he can 
convince his former colleagues on Capitol Hill that he should have the key role 
in shaping the future of U.S. military forces. 
</P>
<P>
After the Thanksgiving break, Cheney -- dressed in a sport shirt and sweater -- 
met with leaders of the military services for the third day on Friday to 
discuss what changes they would make if the Pentagon were to continue the 
budgetary slide of the last five years. One senior Pentagon official present at 
those deliberations said that they have become a "straight, sober assessment" 
of military needs in a time of fiscal retrenchment. 
</P>
<P>
They have also become the forum in which some of the nation's most fundamental 
assumptions have been opened to question. 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin L. Powell, has warned 
Cheney and others in those meetings that in accepting future cuts, American 
leaders must define the point at which the United States would relinquish its 
superpower status, according to one participant. 
</P>
<P>
While Cheney appeared to concede Powell's point, he suggested that dire 
foreboding is unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an irreducible minimum of defense capability that the United States 
is going to require, no matter what happens in the Soviet Union," Cheney said. 
"We are a superpower, and we're always going to want to have the capacity to 
deploy military force to safeguard American interests and to preserve our 
capacity to influence events in the world." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Cheney cautioned that he is "still a great skeptic" 
on the future of Soviet reform efforts. In directing the preparation of the new 
budget, he conceded that he has relented to congressional and public pressure 
in hopes that the concessions would secure him a principal role in shaping the 
new military order. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think vigilance is the order of the day," Cheney said. "I still think 
we have to be very cautious about assuming that Mr. (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev will 
be successful, or assuming that his successors will be more like him than like 
conventional Soviet leaders -- Brezhnev, Khrushchev, Stalin, etc." 
</P>
<P>
Last April, the low-key Cheney made headlines and staked his position as one 
the Bush Administration's most hawkish voices on Soviet issues when he 
predicted that Gorbachev would fail in his reform efforts and be ousted. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Cheney made clear that his own views on Gorbachev's prospects would 
be clearly expressed in the defense budgets he will send to Congress in the 
coming years. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get a fundamental shift in Soviet policy, we have to make sure that we 
have protected our (research and development) base," Cheney said. Calling U.S. 
technological advantages over the Soviet Union "absolutely crucial," Cheney 
added: "You've got to structure your investment strategy accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
That strategy may become most evident in the Pentagon's future budget requests 
for the Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly known as "Star Wars." The 
program has been kept in a separate budget account, and contingency plans for 
deep cuts have not been ordered. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said that "no part of the budget is exempt" from cuts, but he added that 
the "Star Wars" program must continue to investigate a wide range of defensive 
technologies at least until 1994, when the President is scheduled to make a 
decision on whether to deploy a missile shield. 
</P>
<P>
On another high-technology program that has drawn fire from congressional 
critics, Cheney signaled support for the Air Force's planned purchase of 132 
B-2 intercontinental bombers -- at $500 million apiece. But he cautioned that 
Congress has ordered the Pentagon to review the purchase in an effort to reduce 
the cost of the program, and that Defense Department analysts are complying. 
</P>
<P>
While those priorities are likely to draw controversy on Capitol Hill, Cheney 
said he hopes that his realism in facing budget pressures will win him the 
confidence of lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
"If we simply say, 'heck no, we're not willing to get a dime out of the defense 
budget,' you lose your credibility with the Congress and with the public," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not the way I like to operate," said Cheney, who has won high marks 
from lawmakers for his pragmatic approach to dealing with them. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's willingness to deal with Congress on that footing, as well as his 
desire to review the division of labor within the NATO alliance, is expected to 
win him wide support from defense experts on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a mistake for NATO not to look at increased specializations as we 
come down to lower levels," said Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the chairman of the 
Senate Armed Services Committee. "We should not try to do everything." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Cheney called Congress "a major player" in the forthcoming debate 
over the relationship between U.S. forces and strategy. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said lawmakers "probably" will be the principal obstacle 
to his efforts to recast the U.S. armed forces into a smaller military force 
that remains as ready to fight as it is today. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a temptation . . . for Congress not to adopt a coherent overall 
strategy of how you spread fewer dollars across significant requirements," he 
said. "Rather there will be those in Congress who will make decisions based 
upon interests back in their district. 
</P>
<P>
"If Congress makes the decisions primarily upon their impact back home rather 
than what our strategic requirements might be, then we're going to end up with 
less capable forces," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
That is a lesson that Cheney, a former Wyoming congressman, has already 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
In his first budget submission, he tried to cancel a Marine aircraft program 
called the tilt-rotor Osprey. The move drew an army of lobbyists and lawmakers 
whose districts stood to benefit from the program, and they succeeded in 
keeping the program alive -- at least for another year. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope we would now shift the debate to what it should have been and 
what it never has been: 'What do we need for national security?' " said Rep. 
Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
But, Schroeder added, those larger considerations often are squeezed out by 
congressional concerns over more immediate issues -- for example, job losses 
back home. 
</P>
<P>
"Defense bills become public works bills," she said. 
</P>
<P>
That reality has not changed, noted Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), a senior 
member of the House Appropriations Committee. "Members who have weapons 
systems, major suppliers in their districts can feel immediate job losses," he 
said. "Despite all the rhetoric, we're not really prepared for economic 
conversion." 
</P>
<P>
And in spite of Cheney's efforts, some members of Congress, including even some 
in Bush's party, made it clear that they are not about to relinquish the last 
word on the shape of the defense budget to the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be very surprised if this (the budget cutting proposal) is anything more 
than an exercise," Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M) said.
