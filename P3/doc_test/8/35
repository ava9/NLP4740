The formidable marketing machine behind The Flintstones, which premieres in
the US tomorrow, is getting into gear. Even if you never see the film -
which opens later this summer in Europe and Asia - it will be hard to escape
the promotional blitz.
Amblin Entertainment, Steven Spielberg's production company, estimates that
more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m) will be lavished on marketing, more than
twice what was spent on Jurassic Park. The Flintstones film is based on the
1960s cartoon series of life in prehistoric Bedrock. The series holds cachet
with US babyboomers, and viewers in countries such as Britain, Mexico and
Japan, where re-runs have been playing for years.
The toy maker Mattel has signed a deal with Amblin for a new line of
Flintstones dolls, including the Talking Fred. Actor John Goodman, who plays
Fred in the movie, has been taking the doll with him on television
appearances.
Flintstones songs have already become hits. The rock group the B-52s, which
appears in the film as the BC-52s, has two new singles out: its version of
the Flintstones theme song and 'Bedrock Twitch'.
McDonald's has traded in its golden arches in the film for dinosaur tusks,
and has been re-christened Rocdonald's. In exchange for the cameo, the food
chain has launched what it calls its biggest promotion. McDonald's will be
selling Flintstones mugs and t-shirts in 38 countries.
Left-over products from the cartoon era will receive a free ride from the
promotion. Turner Entertainment, which owns the animated series, is
receiving heavy play on television.
The ultimate success of the Flintstones products depends on how much
enthusiasm the film generates at the box-office. In a few months, executives
involved in the promotion may either be crying in their dinosaur milk or
yabba-dabba-doing all the way to the bank.
