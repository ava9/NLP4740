FT  19 DEC 94 / People (Names in the News): Dream time for Montgomery

When Michael Montgomery ended his eight-year career with Walt Disney by
resigning as finance director of Euro Disney, its troubled French
subsidiary, the last thing on his mind was to take another job in
entertainment, writes Alice Rawsthorn.
Now, four months later, he is back in the same business after joining forces
with the 'dream team' - Jeffrey Katzenberg, former head of Disney's movie
studios, Steven Spielberg, director of Jurassic Park and Schindler's List,
and David Geffen, the billionaire music mogul - in their attempt to launch a
new entertainment group.
'It was not what I expected to do,' says Montgomery, 40, whose top priority
in his new job will be to raise capital. 'But this was an opportunity I
couldn't resist. It's one of the most exciting new ventures that anyone
could dream of.'
Katzenberg was the architect of his appointment. The two had worked together
on film-financing projects at Disney where Montgomery was assistant
treasurer from 1986 to 1991 and then treasurer until he moved to Euro Disney
in 1993.
He will be working closely with Katzenberg and with Ronald Nelson, former
finance director of the Paramount entertainment group. Yet Montgomery
insists that there will be no conflict of interest between his role and
Nelson's. 'There is so much work to do here - plenty for everyone. Besides,
I can't think of a nicer guy to work with.'
After four months of self-indulgence - 'doing all the things I haven't had
time for in 15 years, like taking my son to school and improving my golf' -
he is now preparing for a more rigorous regime at the temporary offices in
Los Angeles.
Rigorous it may be, but raising capital for the star-studded team and Geffen
sounds much more enjoyable than struggling to salvage Euro Disney. 'It'll be
hard work,' he says. 'But I can't think of any job which will be more fun.'
