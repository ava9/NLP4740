REUTERS Holdings, the international news and information group, yesterday
confirmed it expected double-digit revenue growth this year, helped by the
impact of sterling's devaluation.
The group, which on Monday announced a Pounds 350m share repurchase scheme,
increased pre-tax profits by 14.6 per cent to Pounds 214.7m in the six
months to June 30. Revenues rose 19.7 per cent to Pounds 895.8m, but after
stripping out the effect of currencies, the gain was only 5.7 per cent.
Mr Peter Job, chief executive, said the share buy-back scheme should be
viewed against the background of a business that was growing strongly. 'We
are comfortable with the market we are in. Financial services is not a
'Jurassic Park' business.'
Group net cash balances totalled Pounds 629.8m at the half-year. Mr Job said
Reuters would still have a sizeable sum to invest even after the repurchase
scheme. 'However, we will not buy businesses just for the sake of it. We do
not want to become a professional acquirer.'
Mr Rob Rowley, finance director, said currency movements were expected to
enhance earnings in the second half, although the benefits would not be as
pronounced as in the opening six months. He said: 'The see-saw of currencies
is a worrying factor, but together with price stability and better order
flows, we expect continued business growth in 1994.'
Operating profits rose 19.2 per cent to Pounds 184.1m, while margins were
maintained at 20.6 per cent.
Mr Rowley said capital expenditure was about Pounds 40m higher at Pounds
105m during the half and might reach a new peak for the year as a whole.
Working capital also increased for the first time in four years.
Mr Job was satisfied with the progress of the group's electronic transaction
product range, particularly Dealing 2000-2 and Instinet. He added: 'The
volumes on Globex, the financial futures matching service, continue to rise
in Paris, but we are concerned that the activity on the system in Chicago
remains low. We are working with the Chicago exchanges to increase volumes.'
Business in the Americas remained strong, and the UK was showing
improvement. Rapid expansion continued in Russia and eastern Europe while
western Europe was mixed. China was especially buoyant in a generally
favourable Asian context.
The interim dividend was raised 17 per cent to 6.2p from 5.3p. Earnings per
share went up to 34.4p, against 24.5p.
