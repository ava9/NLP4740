PUBLISHING NOW
edited by Peter Owen
Peter Owen Pounds 12.95, 175 pages
PUBLISHING, like other industries, is starting to pick itself up from the
floor after the battering it received during the recession. Anyone who wants
an up-date on what has been happening there during the past two traumatic
years could not do better than to consult Publishing Now edited by Peter
Owen, one of the canniest, most durable and adventurous of the few remaining
independent publishers.
Owen has assembled a team of contributors whose professional skills cover
many different aspects of this complex business. Here are people from the
new conglomerates alongside representatives of the old-style
gentleman-publishers; and here are articles by those concerned with literary
fiction, mass paperback fiction, illustrated books, academic books,
children's books, feminist books, gay books.
In all these areas, the period has been one of far-reaching change, and
perhaps the most significant has been the original paperback - a book which
has its first, and possibly only, edition in paperback. Owen's is one such,
and the fact that I am reviewing it gives it parity of esteem with the new
hardbacks on this page. That is something which publishers, particularly
those of serious fiction, have been fighting to achieve for years.
Original paperbacks are not a new phenomenon, not even for literary fiction;
imprints like Serpent's Tail in London and Polygon in Edinburgh having been
publishing them for a long time. But, at the end of 1991 and the beginning
of 1992, several companies with a long and distinguished tradition of
literary fiction publishing, like Secker &amp; Warburg, Chatto &amp; Windus and
Hamish Hamilton, began to publish original paperback fiction.
In an article called 'The Death of the Hardback?' Dan Franklin, the head of
Secker and Warburg, recalls the strategy of compiling a paperback fiction
list with a distinct series identity, selling at Pounds 7.99 in a format
midway between that of the average hardback and the mass-market paperback.
Before the plunge was taken, the support of the booksellers - particularly
Waterstones and Dillons - was canvassed and a positive response given. But
there was still a fear that the books would be consigned to oblivion by the
literary editors of newspapers and magazines.
'Without reviews, (Franklin writes) the books would die. However, our fears
were unfounded. Generally, each book has had at least as much review
coverage as it would have received in hardback.'
In the old days, a small hard-cover sale of around 1,000 copies was enough
to establish a novel; if review coverage was favourable, there was the
expectation of a mass-market paperback edition 12 months later. But this
minimum hardback sale can now be achieved only rarely. Ian Chapman, in his
article on 'Paperback Publishing,' explains: 'The view is that anywhere
between a 4,000 and 10,000 copy sale at a midway price of Pounds 8.99, let
us say, is better than a sale of under 1,000 copies at Pounds 15.'
Clearly, it is too early to ring the death-knell of the fiction hardback -
let alone the non-fiction hardback in such areas as literary biography - but
we are likely in the future to see more and more novels appearing first time
round as 'C-format' (ie, posh-looking) paperbacks.
A further phenomenon, that of marketing the book on a diskette that the
customer inserts into a portable computer and reads from the screen, is not
dealt with here. Yet, American publishers like Random House are already
exploring this in association with AppleMac computers. Jurassic Park, The
Portrait of Dorian Gray and The Annotated Alice are among titles on offer in
this form.
It might sound ridiculous but there are certain advantages in having a book
on disc. A paperback, however up-market, tends to foreclose on a reader
unless he or she exerts pressure to keep it open. The first two titles above
would clearly be enhanced by the computer's graphics and, in the third, the
footnotes are almost as great a delight as the text (and are embedded much
more neatly in it on screen).
For couples in bed, where one partner wishes to switch out the light and go
to sleep and the other to continue reading, the noiseless computer screen
that casts almost no light beyond itself is the perfect solution.
Advances in electronic printing have brought about many fundamental changes
 -a technological revolution which is continuing. Some of the implications
are dealt with by Robert Adkinson, of Thames &amp; Hudson, who underlines the
internationalism of the modern printing process.
The co-edition - a book funded jointly and published simultaneously in
several different countries - remains of paramount importance for most art
books. Colour reproduction, already at a high standard, is likely to improve
further through 'non-impact printing, with ink jets operating to pre-set
co-ordinates controlled by computer.'
The inroads made into the industry by computers are apparent throughout many
of the articles. There are creatures like EPOS which monitor the sales of
stock in the chain-store bookshops; JANET, which gives librarians rapid
access to information; and CARL, a document delivery service in Denver,
Colorado, with which Blackwell's has formed an alliance.
Electronics do not do it all, though. Publishing still depends on human
input from people like editors (Dan Franklin), publicists (Jacqueline
Graham), agents (Giles Gordon), booksellers (Tim Waterstone), and last - but
by no means least - authors (Peter Vansittart). These people all contribute
lively articles to this stimulating book.
