FT  14 SEP 93 / Observer: Jurassic jitters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To listen to France's culture minister, Jacques Toubon, you would think that
Stephen Spielberg's 'velociraptors' were about to step off French screens
and devour their audiences.
At last weekend's Deauville festival of American films, Toubon cited
Jurassic Park - released in France next month - as the latest example of
Hollywood's cultural invasion of his country.
Such is the dominance of US film-makers and distributors that one in every
five French cinemas will be showing it, he complained; the dinosaur
spectacular 'is very impressive, but not at all moving nor human, because of
its special effects, and it threatens the French identity'.
But, despite the fears of Toubon, many French seem to be happy to let their
identity be threatened. A poll last month for the Nouvelle Economiste
magazine showed that 80-83 per cent of those in the prime cinema-going age
group of 18-34 considered American productions as good or better than French
films.
