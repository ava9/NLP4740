GROVE SCHOOL EQUIPS MUSIC AFICIONADOS TO PLAY FOR A LIVING

Joe Kidwell kept warm through three Alaskan winters by humming "Summertime" 
while on ski patrol for the U. S. Army. But he recently got the chills singing 
it at a Van Nuys music school where such pop icons as Linda Ronstadt and Barry 
Manilow have taken classes. 
</P>
<P>
"Summertime, and the living is easy," croaked Kidwell, 21, wide-eyed and 
trembling slightly with stage fright during his first performance for fellow 
students in a class at Grove School of Music. But with the steady encouragement 
of his teacher and classmates, Kidwell's reedy voice became smooth enough for 
him to belt out the last few lines of the George Gershwin tune. 
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, Grove's reputation for preparing students, such as 
the clean-cut Kidwell, as well as aspiring long-haired singers for musical 
success has enabled it to double its enrollment and to move out of its cramped 
quarters in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

$1.5-Million Renovation 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley's only music trade school, which offers a variety of 
classes, including rock keyboard and Latin percussion, occupies the old Daily 
News building in the 14500 block of Sylvan Street. The school has spent $1.5 
million to renovate the building, including the addition of two recording 
studios. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an outstanding school -- one of the best in the country," said Jack 
Wheaton, administrative director of jazz studies at USC's School of Music. 
</P>
<P>
"They're particularly strong in turning out people who are specifically trained 
to go out and make a living in music, be it nightclubs or writing for TV and 
film." 
</P>
<P>
"They have some fantastic teachers," said David Roitstein, a professor at 
CalArts. "I have a lot of respect for what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
But the school that trains its 600 students to become, or at least rub 
shoulders with, some of the world's best jazz, rock and popular musicians 
cannot boast of a glamorous campus. The seedy pawnshops and discount stores of 
Van Nuys Boulevard are just a block away from the school's one-story building. 
</P>
<P>
"This school shouldn't be here," said Swiss drummer Pascal Chollet, 25, one of 
the 100 or so foreign students enrolled at Grove. "We should be in Hollywood 
where the clubs are." 
</P>
<P>
But Joel DiBartolo, a bass player on "The Tonight Show" and an instructor at 
Grove, pointed out that many of the city's movie and recording studios are in 
the San Fernando Valley. For example, Universal Studios is in Universal City 
and Evergreen Recording Studios is in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"Musicians these days can't just depend on the club scene for work," DiBartolo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its unglamorous location, Grove manages to attract students from the 
East Coast, Hawaii and Japan. Ronstadt took a guitar class there in the 
school's early days, and Manilow studied electronic music there even after he 
became famous, according to Todd Ferguson, the school's administrator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long Hours 
</P>
<P>
Accredited by the National Assn. of Schools of Music, Grove offers several 
one-year programs, including general musicianship, recording and engineering, 
composing and arranging, and guitar. Costs vary from $200 for a 20-hour 
workshop to thousands of dollars for the yearlong programs. 
</P>
<P>
From early in the morning until long after midnight, students crowd the 
school's gray, carpeted halls, carrying instrument cases and music folders. It 
is not uncommon for cafeteria patrons to have students interrupt their lunch 
with spontaneous renditions of country and Western songs or guitar "riffs." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the students resemble the members of the long-haired rock band Bon 
Jovi, whose members wear tight black clothes and earrings; others would not 
look out of place in a business office. 
</P>
<P>
Chip McClelland, 49, still dresses like an accountant on holiday in beige 
slacks and a button-down shirt. He left his accounting firm and family behind 
four months ago in Maui, Hawaii, to pursue his passion -- playing the keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
"Half the people on the island think I'm crazy to come over here with a bunch 
of heavy metal guitar players, but my wife understands," McClelland said. "I 
knew I had holes in my training, but I was almost buried by the work last 
quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Caruso, 26, who traveled from Queens, N. Y., to Van Nuys to perfect his 
guitar playing, also finds the curriculum challenging. Caruso wears his long, 
black hair in a frizzy halo and said he performs on weekends in a band called 
Chastity. 
</P>
<P>
"I can get on stage and play rock all day, but I want to be a better musician 
than that," Caruso said. He said he doesn't have the discipline to learn to 
read music on his own. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Versatility Essential 
</P>
<P>
The professional music world has become so competitive that, in order to have 
an edge, even rockers have to be able to play a variety of styles, said Rob 
McConnell, a well-known trombone player and bandleader who teaches at Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, a guitarist should know the whole electronic side of things, 
synthesized music, doing solos, acoustic, 12-string and maybe even how to play 
another instrument," McConnell said. "Otherwise, with the turnover in the 
popularity of rock groups, you could be a hot rock player today and some bum on 
the street tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Since the school was established in 1974, its philosophy has been to make its 
students marketable, said founder and President Dick Grove, 61. A well-known 
composer, arranger and pianist, Grove teaches at the school. 
</P>
<P>
John Campbell, 28, of Claremont said his education at Grove has paid off. A 
free-lance keyboard player, composer and arranger, Campbell was able to build a 
home recording studio this year with his $85,000 in earnings. Attending the 
school "changed my life," Campbell said. "I'd never be this successful 
otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Gates, 33, of Canoga Park said he has only made $17,000 as a free-lancer 
during the nine months since he graduated. But he credits the school with 
teaching him how to write music, including jingles for Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
Being a musician "is not like being a lawyer or accountant," he said. "It takes 
years to build contacts, but I love music and that's what drives me," despite 
constant rejections and low income.
