JAZZ NOTES: LOCAL CORNETIST BERRY'S A GLOBE-TROTTER TOO 
</P>

A lot of us might think of cornetist and bandleader Bill Berry as just a local 
player, one who can often be heard in clubs such as the Biltmore Hotel's Grand 
Avenue Bar -- he's there with his L.A. Big Band on Monday at 5 p.m. -- 
Chadney's or the Indigo Jazz Club. But Berry is a globe-trotter as well. He's 
recently returned from a month in England and Sweden, and after a few dates in 
the Southland this week -- besides the Biltmore, his big band plays a free 
concert in the Times Mirror Central Court of the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art on Sunday, 1:30 p.m. -- he scampers off for a three-week tour of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
In England, where Berry travels about twice a year, he played the Birmingham 
and Grimsby Jazz Festivals and a number of clubs in London, such as the 
well-known Pizza Express. While working there, he ran into some hometown 
musical pals who were also touring the Continent. "(Guitarist) Ron Anthony, 
(trumpeter) Buddy Childers and (bassist) Jim Hughart (all in London with Frank 
Sinatra) came down one night and sat in with me," he said. "I also ran into 
(pianist) Nat Pierce, who happened to be over there, and we played together at 
an afternoon session at London's Guild Hall." Berry plays with Pierce's 
Capp-Pierce Juggernaut Big Band at the free Malibu Arts Festival in Malibu, 
Saturday, 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Berry returns to Great Britain in September, to take part in a film written and 
directed by Alan Plater. "It's what we'd call a Movie of the Week about a 
trumpet player," he said. "I only have a few lines but I guess I'll do quite a 
bit of playing." 
</P>
<P>
The brassman, who is renowned for his early '60s tenure with the Duke Ellington 
Orchestra, is represented on two recent reissues, his own "Hello, Rev" (Concord 
Jazz CD), and a 2-record "Woody Herman Live in 1957" set (Status Records). "We 
recorded that at a dance in Omaha," said Berry, who was with Herman for "two or 
three years" during the '50s. Asked what he recalled of the late leader, Berry 
said, "Woody was one of the greatest, that's all. Everything about him was 
special."

MEMORIAL FOR CARAVAN: Organist Jimmy Caravan, leader of the Blues Caravan who 
died on July 7 of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, will be honored at the Jimmy 
Caravan Memorial Benefit, tonight and Saturday at the Indigo Jazz Club in 
Compton. 
</P>
<P>
The blues was Caravan's first love, and members of L.A. blues community -- 
Harmonica Fats, Joe Houston, Guitar Shorty, among them -- plus Eddie Daniels 
from the Platters and Blues Caravan alumni saxman Steve Hooks and guitarist Ray 
Bailey will perform at the benefit. Showtimes are 4:30-8:30 p.m. and 9:30 
p.m.-1 a.m., today, and 9:30 p.m.-1 a.m., Saturday. The $7 (or 2/$10) requested 
donation will go to Carvan's wife and daughter, said Hooks, who is organizing 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured (Jimmy) would want something like this," Hooks said of the benefit. 
"He touched so many people's lives and not that many of them got a chance to 
pay their respects. I didn't want him to go out without doing something." 
Information: (213) 632-1234.

CLUB BEAT: Bassist Luther Hughes is in charge of the jazz comings-and-goings at 
El Matador, (16903 Algonquin St., Huntington Beach, (714) 846-5337). Hughes is 
in with his quartet, featuring guitarist Frank Potenza, tonight and Saturday, 
8:30 p.m. There's no cover for the bassist's band, but the club does charge for 
big bands that appear on Mondays. This week, it's the Joey Sellers Jazz 
Aggregation, and Aug. 6, Roger Neumann's Rather Large Band. . . . The former 
Club 88 has reopened as Radio (11784 Pico Blvd., West Los Angeles (213) 
444-9344) and will go with Latin jazz on Sundays. This week, Iguana is 
spotlighted.

RIM SHOTS: The annual free Watts Towers Jazz Festival takes place Sunday at 
Watts Towers Arts Center (1727 E. 107th St., Watts, (213) 569-8181), 11 a.m.-6 
p.m. This year's lineup includes Cedar Walton, Don Cherry, Papo Conga, Johnny 
Otis, Nedra Wheeler and the B Sharp Quintet. . . . Filmmaker Spike Lee will 
autograph copies of his new book, "Mo' Better Blues," about the making of his 
film of the same name -- which centers around the life of a jazz musician -- at 
the Samuel French Theatre and Film Bookshop (7623 Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood), 
today, from 5-7 p.m. . . . Bandleader/reedman/composer Benny Carter was the 
recent recipient of The American Federation of Jazz Societies' "The Benny," a 
bronze statuette in the likeness of Carter, created by artist/bassist John 
Heard. The award honored Carter for his achievements in a 60-year career; 
forthcoming presentations will honor others who have made great contributions 
to jazz, while keeping the magnitude of Carter's efforts in mind.
