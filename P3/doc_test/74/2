WHAT WITH our weather and weird licensing laws, you would not think that
Britain could grow too many jazz musicians suitable for export. But we
continue to produce new talent and just about sustain the old hands. Pianist
Julian Joseph is part of the new crop and with the release of his second
album, Reality (East West 4509-93024), he maintains the momentum started by
last year's surging The Language of Truth.
Second albums are always hard to pitch, especially if the first has been a
critical success, and Joseph has responded here by lowering the temperature
and replacing the soul vocals of Sharon Musgrave with his own crooning on
two tracks. The first ploy works, the right hand shimmering while strong
left-hand chords control the dynamic of Joseph's well wrought compositions
darkly. The mid-Atlantic crooning is a mistake, however. Its flatness
deflates the late night atmosphere created by saxophonists Jean Toussaint
and altoist Pete King and the half-baked lyrics are hard to swallow. As a
cursed second album, it is a qualified success.
Guitarist Jim Mullen, who has cult followings from Havana to Putney, is one
of the old hands we only just sustain. The Glaswegian, who has played in
more pubs than Eric Bristow, was most often found seated beside tenorist
Dick Morrissey spinning off lithe, dancing solos. But Soundbites (EFZ 1003),
an unexpected pleasure, shows Mullen moving away from the British jazz funk
sound the pair pioneered to original bop compositions. Tenorist Dave
O'Higgins, another fine player who has difficulty staying in the limelight,
intersperses Mullen's taut lines with grainy choruses which combine to
produce a thoroughly English and restrained form of post bop.
Mullen turns up again with his old sparring partner Morrissey on a Willesden
produced paean to 1960s soul jazz and the Hammond organ. Mike Carr's Good
Times &amp; the Blues (Cargogold CGCD 191) is swingingly greasy as Blue Note's
finest. The tough talking compositions all belong to Carr and he drives both
trio and quartet with the bass pedals of a fast moving but agile C3
juggernaut.
What makes British jazz fundamentally different, arguably, is the direct
link to Africa via the blues which defines American contemporary music.
Nowhere is that living connection better demonstrated than in the music of
pianist Randy Weston. Volcano Blues (Verve 519269) reunites the North
African explorer with arranger Melba Liston for 13 sides of bright swaying
big band charts, spiced with African colour, the whole stewed in the blues.
To hear Hamiett Bluiett (baritone sax), Teddy Edwards (tenor) and Miles'
heir Wallace Roney jostling with Obo Addy (percussion), Jamil Nasser (bass)
and Talib Kibwe (alto sax) is a natural delight.
If Weston shows us where American jazz music comes from, the woofer testing,
heavy kicking tunes of electric bassist Marcus Miller shows where some of it
is going. The Sun Don't Lie (Dreyfus FDM365 602) features Wayne Shorter
(tenor sax), David Sanborn (alto sax) and even the late-Miles Davis among
many others in a bewilderingly high powered, jazz funk tour de force. Miller
 -producer, composer and virtuoso bassist - has a knack for matching
commerciality with credible licks and this latest outing should find favour
with the jazz fans.
A major influence on Miller and a model for many upcoming electric bass
players is the late Jaco Pastorius. At the time of his sudden, violent death
in 1987, the American was shaping a solo career which involved innovative
big band schemes. The Japanese reissue Holiday for Pans (Sound Hills
SSCD-8001), which features steel drums, is both grand folly and elegant
masterwork. It employs 12 musicians, Toots Thielmens and Wayne Shorter
included, with the Mike Gibbs Orchestra plus strings thrown in for good
measure. It is not cheap at Pounds 22 but worth every penny to hear the
Beatles 'She's Leaving Home' done by steel drum in a jazz setting.
