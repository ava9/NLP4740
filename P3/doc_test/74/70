SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: A MELLOWER MOUZON IS DUE AT HUMPHREY'S

During the mid-1970s, drummer Alphonse Mouzon pounded himself into the minds of 
fusion jazz fans with his machine-gun attack behind guitarist Larry Coryell in 
The Eleventh House band. Mouzon has diversified and mellowed since then. During 
the 1980s, he turned out a series of light jazz recordings packed with lush 
melodies and thick electronic instrumentation, but little of his former fire. 
</P>
<P>
His newest album, "As You Wish," released this year, continues this lighter 
mode. Mouzon plays drums, digital drums, electric bass, percussion and assorted 
synthesizers, with saxophonist Gary Meeks doing the lion's share of the melodic 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
Mouzon is also engrossed in a legal battle with Optimism, his label from 
1986-88. 
</P>
<P>
Among his charges are that he received only $13,000 in royalties from his 1988 
hit album, "Early Spring," which the label says sold 50,000 to 60,000 copies. 
Mouzon said he should have netted about $70,000. Optimism also rereleased the 
1981 "Morning Sun" album on compact disc in 1988 without Mouzon's permission, 
making a new pirate master tape from the original vinyl LP -- the resulting 
sound quality was horrible. After several stages of trial proceedings, Mouzon 
has received $16,250 from Optimism for copyright infringement. He was awarded 
an additional $28,000 earlier this month, but must wait six months while 
Optimism appeals. Eventually, he wants a retrial, and he seeks a settlement of 
at least $3 million, down from his original request of $14 million for a 
variety of violations of his deal with Optimism. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he has discovered a new source of income -- licensing his music to 
televised soap operas and sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I made $8,000 in June from 'General Hospital' and 'One Life to Live,' and I 
can make $4,000 during one weekend of golf on 'CBS Sports,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mouzon is mixing a new album for release later this year or early next, and he 
also hopes to remake some of his '70s fusion music, record an acoustic jazz 
album and maybe even a heavy metal session. 
</P>
<P>
With all of his successes and experience, it seems odd that Mouzon would be 
tabbed for next Wednesday night's "Rising Star Concert" at the Catamaran Resort 
Hotel in Mission Beach. Mouzon will concentrate on music from his most recent 
albums, including "As You Wish," "Early Spring," "Back to Jazz" and "Love 
Fantasy," backed by his touring band. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the broad-minded Mouzon, veteran jazz drummer Louis Hayes continues in 
the pure acoustic jazz vein he started out in during the 1950s, in bands led by 
pianist Horace Silver and reed man Yusef Lateef, and continued in during the 
1960s in bands headed by saxophonist Cannonball Adderley and pianist Oscar 
Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes plays Elario's next Monday and Tuesday nights with his own band, 
including Charles Tolliver on trumpet, Clint Houston on bass, George Cables on 
piano and John Stubblefield on sax. 
</P>
<P>
Sets will include music from Hayes' "Una Max" album, released earlier this year 
and named in honor of fellow drummer Max Roach. Hayes said being a leader 
doesn't make him play drums any differently than he would on someone else's 
session. 
</P>
<P>
"The only difference is I'm more in control if I want to have certain things 
featuring myself. A lot of times if the drummer is not the leader, people just 
want the rhythm section to fit in." On "Una Max," Hayes gave himself three drum 
solos, and promised several in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad ends its summer outdoor jazz series with a performance from 6 to 8 
tomorrow night by Ira Liss and the Big Band Jazz Machine in Magee Park at 
Carlsbad Boulevard and Beech Street. The program grew to nine shows this year 
from six last year. Colleen Finnegan, the city's community arts coordinator, 
pronounced the events "very successful," and said they drew at least 400 to 450 
listeners to local parks each week. There were glitches, though. The most 
glaring was the scheduled Aug. 10 appearance by Gene Perry and his group Afro 
Rumba. Perry didn't show up for the date and sent stand-ins, including 
multi-instrumentalist Turiya and keyboard man Joe Garrison. "I did not get five 
guys in matching shirts banging out the Caribbean beat," Finnegan lamented. "I 
got five musicians doing standards with a Latin beat."
