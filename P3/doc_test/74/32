The embarrassment of riches at the Festival International de Jazz leaves no 
idiom untapped. Typically, though contemporary jazz is strongly represented (by 
Elvin Jones, Arthur Blythe, McCoy Tyner, Archie Shepp and dozens more), 
traditional sounds such as the blues are not ignored; in fact, one outdoor 
stage is devoted to daily blues sessions, mainly by French Canadian groups 
(despite such names as The Okazoo Blues Band), while Robert Cray, Dr. John and 
Wilson Pickett have filled indoor halls.

Much ingenuity has been shown in mixing Canadian and American talent. The 
Modern Jazz Quartet joined forces with a Canadian string quartet, the Quatuor 
Morency. Thursday evening the vocal-and-bass duo of Sheila Jordan and Harvey 
Swartz shared a show with singer Karen Young and bassist Michel Donato, a 
Quebec couple who have carried the same idea much further: they both sing; they 
have a fresher, bolder (and bilingual) repertoire, and Young's voice is strong 
and assured. Score one for Canada. Late in the show they switched partners; 
finally all four got together for a joyous two-voice, two-bass hit.

The Latin temperament, a product of the sharp increase in the Spanish speaking 
population here, has been nourished daily by Hilton Ruiz, Milton Nascimento, 
Chick Corea and, most memorably, by singer Celia Cruz, the Cuban-born salsa 
spitfire who, despite a shower that became a heavy storm Tuesday evening, drew 
a crowd estimated at 75,000 to a two block area in the Boulevard Rene Levesque. 
</P>
<P>
On a stage decorated with the flags of Mexico, Cuba and Panama, Cruz shared her 
program with the Venezuelan singer Oscar d'Leon and a 15-piece band. This was 
basically dance music, but dancing became a bit awkward amid a sea of 
umbrellas. A jazz interlude was inserted when the saxophonists David (Fathead) 
Newman and Chico Freeman soloed powerfully on "Blue Bossa."

A cornucopia of pianists Wednesday found Keith Jarrett's recital coinciding 
with that of Michel Camilo, a virtuoso from the Dominican Republic. We chose 
Camilo, who is extraordinary but extravagant; his concert was almost literally 
a smashing success, as he used formidable technique to pound his way through 
original pieces such as the Latinesque "Island Stomp." The brute-force formula 
works for him; he had the crowd in an uproar, but his subtler side (displayed 
in his own gentle "Dans l'Amour") was too seldom heard, and the excesses 
extended to his bassist and the laborious drummer. 
</P>
<P>
At an adjoining theater a little later, the Americans Kirk Lightsey and Harold 
Danko (both Chet Baker alumni) formed a piano duo that aimed not at the jugular 
like Camilo, but at the mind and heart. Their cohesion is fantastic. It is as 
if some higher power were controlling these four hands, making them move as 
one. 
</P>
<P>
The program consisted mainly of intricately arranged tunes by Wayne Shorter 
("Anamaria," "Iris," "Pinocchio"); even when they played a Danko original it 
was entitled "Wayne Shorter." The first 45 minutes was spellbinding, but as 
time wore on the persistent sound of two pianos began to wear thin. 
</P>
<P>
Most rewarding of all was Tommy Flanagan's late evening appearance at the 
Nouveau Monde Theatre. Here was the perfect formula: much better (an 
Ellington-Strayhorn medley), much bebop (tunes by Gillespie, Parker, Thad 
Jones, J.J. Johnson), and no bombast. In George Mraz he has the Tommy Flanagan 
of the bass, whose every solo is a melodic marvel. The wit and empathy of the 
drummer Lewis Nash rounded out this spirited trio. 
</P>

Among the Canadians heard at free concerts in and around the Rue Ste. Catherine 
were Sylvain Provost, a Pat Metheny inspired guitarist, whose quartet played in 
a large tent off the street; Hans Leveille, a graduate of Los Angeles' Guitar 
Institute, whose sextet pumped out heavy-handed fusion in a giant four-story 
shopping mall; and Streetnix, heard in open air concerts at the Place des Arts. 
Patterned after the Dirty Dozen Band from New Orleans (they are also in the 
festival), Streetnix used an incongruous old time set-up (tuba, trumpet, drums, 
and two young women playing alto sax and trombone) to play tunes by Mingus, 
Bird and Monk. Amazingly, it worked.
