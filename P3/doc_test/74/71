Though Orange County still lacks a big-name jazz venue such as Catalinain Los 
Angeles or Elario's in San Diego, there still were plenty of sounds for the 
digging here in the past year. Here are five of the best: 
</P>
<P>
* Jack DeJohnette, with guitarist Pat Metheny, keyboardist Herbie Hancock and 
bassist Dave Holland at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, June 15. 
Despite smudgy sound, the drummer and his well-known sidemen offered smart, 
rhythmically accessible compositions and a generous sampling of free form 
interplay during a long, ultra-contemporary set that highlighted Holland's wise 
technical skills and DeJohnette's raw power. This is one superstar 
collaboration worth a sequel. 
</P>
<P>
* Anita O'Day at Cafe Lido, Sunday, May 13. An afternoon spent with a legend. 
What the singer has lost in clarity over the last 40 years, she has gained in 
character, and the chance to see her emote in such intimate surroundings was a 
pleasure indeed. Hip, attuned support came from saxophonist Gordon Brisker, 
pianist Marty Harris, bassist Harvey Newmark and drummer Paul Kreibichq. 
</P>
<P>
* Miles Davis at the Coach House, Feb. 23. We get to see Davis a lot here in 
Orange County -- this was his third Coach House appearance in nine months -- 
and his play list hasn't really changed much in the last few years. But every 
Davis show has its transcendent moments, and this one came during Michael 
Jackson's "Human Nature," a surprisingly appropriate vehicle for Davis' lyrical 
minimalism and rhythmic mix. 
</P>
<P>
* Shorty Rogers, Bill Perkins with the Les Czimber Trio at Gustaf Anders, Oct. 
28. Trumpeter Rogers, one of the deans of the West Coast sound, stuck to 
original material without the benefit of having rehearsed the rhythm section. 
The results were exciting, as Rogers blew light, yet involved narratives that 
contrasted with Perkins' more muscular tenor sax sound. Credit pianist Czimber, 
bassist Bruce Lett and drummer Nick Martinis as quick studies. 
</P>
<P>
* Eric Marienthal with the Luther Hughes Trio, El Matador, Aug. 31. Once again, 
intimacy was a plus as saxophonist Marienthal, usually seen in much larger 
venues with Chick Corea's Elektric band, teamed with dapper L.A.-based 
keyboardist Tom Ranier, bassist Hughes and drummer Chuck Landis to show some 
chops on all-out versions of tunes like John Coltrane's "Giant Steps." A show 
full of spontaneity, responsiveness and blazing improvisation. Music always 
seems hotter when you're close enough to see the musicians sweat. 
</P>
<P>
* Honorable mention goes to Bill Bruford and Earthworks' Oct. 19 Coach House 
show, a promising hybrid of electric and acoustic, traditional and exploratory, 
that other fusion bands would do well to emulate. 
</P>
<P>
* With that in mind, this year's Waste o' Time award is presented to Acoustic 
Alchemy for its July 20 Coach House show, a somnambulate mix of acoustic 
guitars and synthesizer wash put to predictably bland themes and repetitive 
rhythms. Guitarists Nick Webb and Greg Carmichael would do well to put their 
considerable technical facilities to more serious use.
