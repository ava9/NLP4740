As a secretary back in Detroit, Dee Dee McNeil didn't think she'd become a 
singer. A talent for writing poetry led to a job as a songwriter for Motown 
Records, where she penned tunes for Diana Ross and the Supremes ("Discover 
Me"), Gladys Knight and the Pips ("Somebody Stole the Sunshine") and the Four 
Tops ("What Is a Man"). She was on her way. 
</P>
<P>
But McNeil, who will appear Monday at the Cafe Lido in Newport Beach as part of 
the Benson &amp; Hedges Blues festival taking place next week at several 
Southland venues, didn't become a pop singer. She had grown up listening to 
Dinah Washington, Billie Holiday and Dakota Stanton, music that her parents 
played around the house, and had other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved jazz and blues," she said recently, "and the songs I was writing all 
used blues and jazz changes." With encouragement from Motown record producers, 
the secretary began to sing. 
</P>
<P>
McNeil moved to Los Angeles in 1970 "looking for a career break." She gained 
some visibility after joining the Watts Prophets, a vocal ensemble that did 
ethnic poetry and original music. Their album, "Rappin' Black in a White 
World," was her first recorded work. 
</P>
<P>
Now living in San Diego, the singer is in demand at Southern California clubs, 
having lately appeared at Monteleone's and the Biltmore Hotel's Grand Ave. Bar, 
both in Los Angeles, and at Elario's in La Jolla. She has also performed in 
Japan and New Zealand and appeared at the International Jazz Festival in Vienna 
in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, McNeil played at the Cafe Lido, where she'll continue each Monday 
through June. Backed by a satisfying trio of drummer Harold Mason, bassist 
Louie Spears and pianist Lanny Hartley, the singer showed an apparently 
boundless supply of enthusiasm for performing as well as for the material she 
sang. 
</P>
<P>
She said she likes to think of herself as a song stylist, and -- like Nancy 
Wilson, whose voice her voice sometimes resembles -- McNeil can pack a phrase 
with musical twists and turns without ever losing sight of the lyric's meaning. 
She gets warm and breathy in the lower registers, sweet and crystalline in the 
upper. Her scatting is quick, sharp and inventive. 
</P>
<P>
McNeil, who teaches classes in jazz appreciation through the city Cultural Arts 
Department in Los Angeles to students ranging from preschoolers to senior 
citizens, can also be instructional on the bandstand. She preceded her 
rendition of "Lover Man" by explaining that Billie Holiday's recording with 
"fiddles," as Holiday reportedly called them, was the first by a black female 
vocalist to use strings. In a couple of lines during the song, McNeil recalled 
not only Holiday's phrasing, but her tonal quality as well. 
</P>
<P>
McNeil, who also has a taste for Latin and Brazilian numbers, said she has a 
special fondness of the blues: "The blues developed from the slave songs, and 
that music was transformed into gospel and jazz. It's the roots of American 
music, and that's why I love it."

 Dee Dee McNeil appears with pianist Dwight Dickerson, bassist Louis Spears and 
drummer Harold Mason Monday at the Cafe Lido, 501 30th St., Newport Beach.
