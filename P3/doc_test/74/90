There are more than a few good musicians populating the Los Angeles jazz scene 
who, for this reason or that one, don't get the recognition they deserve. 
Pianist Brian O'Rourke should be taken off that list pronto. 
</P>
<P>
In an appearance with bassist Ernie McDaniel and drummer Kenny Dennis at 
Chadney's in Burbank Wednesday, O'Rourke delivered renditions of classic pop 
and jazz standards that were marked by abundant spirit, solid musicianship and 
a sense of teamwork among the participants. 
</P>
<P>
The youthful pianist, who has been heard with Jack Sheldon, Frank Sinatra Jr. 
and Gerald Wilson, employs a light touch and a quick-think technique, and he 
dances about the keyboard with an Astaire-like elegance, leaving shimmering 
melodies scattered like sequins in his wake. He uses a lot of body language as 
he improvises, cocking his head to his right when he gets into a cooking 
groove, pulling back from the keyboard -- as if to better examine what he's 
playing -- when he executes a lickety-split line, and bouncing his torso in 
tempo on the medium-paced tunes. It's obvious he enjoys his chosen line of 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Parker's "Scrapple From the Apple" exemplified O'Rourke at his best. He 
delivered the melody with a contrapuntal bass line that, if you listened 
closely, was another melody, that of "Honeysuckle Rose," the tune from which 
three quarters of "Scrapple" is harmonically derived. His solo included a 
bluesiness reminiscent of Oscar Peterson, ringing parallel octaves of stunning 
facility and chordal passages that rapidly moved down, then up, then back down 
again, like a child devising a creative way to hop two-legged down the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis and McDaniel were essential components to the success of the show that 
also included "I Thought About You" and "Take the 'A' Train." The bassist's big 
sound provided lush low-end support for O'Rourke's improvisations, and Dennis' 
crisp drum work added rhythmic encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
With more exposure as a leader, Brian O'Rourke, who plays tonight with Dennis' 
trio at the Biltmore Hotel's Grand Avenue Bar, could easily become one of the 
mainstays of L.A.'s jazz mainstream. ZAN STEWART
