BLAME IT ON 'LA BAMBA'; 
</P>
<P>
IN RECORDING ITS NEW 'THE NEIGHBORHOOD' ALBUM, LOS LOBOS WRESTLED WITH 
QUESTIONS OF ARTISTIC PURITY AND COMMERCIAL COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"There's no success like failure and failure's no success at all," Bob Dylan 
wrote more than 25 years ago, capturing the ironic nature of these powerful but 
unpredictable forces. Depending on how they are handled, success can often lead 
to failure, and failure can spur one on to success. 
</P>
<P>
One reason Los Lobos has taken so long to record the true follow-up to its 1987 
album, "By the Light of the Moon," is that the East Los Angeles-spawned quintet 
has been dealing with questions of success and possible failure. At stake: the 
group's artistic purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"Moon" was a dark, moving series of tales about the troubled pursuit of the 
American Dream, seen inescapably through a barrio perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Arguably the most culturally arresting and musically embracing work by a Los 
Angeles-based group in nearly a decade, the graceful, warm-spirited collection 
sold a respectable 400,000 copies and was named to the year-end Top 10 lists of 
numerous critics. 
</P>
<P>
Yet "Moon" was almost totally eclipsed in the public mind by the runaway 
success a few months later of Los Lobos' next recording venture: four songs for 
the soundtrack of "La Bamba," the film biography of '50s Los Angeles Latino 
rock star Ritchie Valens. The album sold more than 2 million copies and Los 
Lobos' title track spent 3 weeks at No. 1 on the pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
The natural thing from a commercial standpoint would have been for Los Lobos to 
return with another collection of good-time oldies. But that would have meant 
setting aside the compelling vision that made "Moon" and the earlier "How Will 
the Wolf Survive?" recordings so memorable. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the quintet released "La Pistola y El Corazon," an album of Mexican 
folk music. The album sold about 100,000 copies -- impressive for such a daring 
venture, but negligible when compared to the "La Bamba" success. 
</P>
<P>
Louie Perez and David Hidalgo, the group's primary songwriters, now admit that 
Los Lobos was, in some ways, buying time with the "La Pistola" album. 
</P>
<P>
"The only sad part of the 'Moon' album (experience) was that it was 
overshadowed by 'La Bamba,' " said Hidalgo, who also sings lead on most Los 
Lobos tunes. He was sitting with Perez on the porch of Perez's old family house 
in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice to see the crowds start getting bigger at the shows, but we would 
wonder sometimes why these people were in the theater. Was it to see us or just 
because of the movie? So, in a way we were removed from some of that success." 
</P>
<P>
The "Pistola" project, he added, was designed to salute the Mexican folk music 
that the group played for years at weddings and dances in East Los Angeles 
before moving over to rock in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, who plays drums and writes most of the band's lyrics, said "Pistola" 
gave them a way to "dig back, get back to us again . . . help us get on the 
right track to write 
</P>
<P>
this new album." 
</P>
<P>
The band's new album, "The Neighborhood," features a few bluesy, high-spirited 
workouts that should appeal to "La Bamba" fans, but mainly the album -- which 
will be released Tuesday -- radiates with the disarming artistic vision 
exhibited in "By the Light of the Moon." (See adjoining review). 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't always easy. 
</P>
<P>
Los Lobos -- which will be in concert Oct. 18 at the Starlight Bowl in San 
Diego and Oct. 19 at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles -- began work on the new 
album in late 1988, expecting to finish in time for release last January. But 
writing it took longer than expected. One reason: "La Bamba's" success. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt great when (Warner Bros. Records president) Lenny Waronker told us, 
'Don't worry about the 'La Bamba' thing. . . . Get back to what you guys are 
about,' " said Perez, who tends to speak more during interviews than Hidalgo. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's not that we ever thought of trying to make 'La Bamba II.' That would 
have been ridiculous. But there's no doubt that during the course of writing 
the songs for this album there was this thing looming over you . . . the 
thought that you have to live up to the commercial success that we had with 'La 
Bamba.' " 
</P>
<P>
Perez paused -- as if trying to find the right words to describe the 
psychological currents at work in the band as they made the new album. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we told ourselves a few times that maybe we shouldn't be as dark and 
as introspective as 'Moon.' . . . That maybe we should do something more 
accessible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But every time we started going too far in that direction, we found ourselves 
stopping and clearing the table . . . starting all over, getting back to 
something that really meant something to us. 
</P>
<P>
When Perez, 37, talks about his neighborhood, on the porch of the small, 
one-bedroom house that his grandparents passed on to his dad when his parents 
got married, he is also talking about his music. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a funny place, kind of in the middle of nowhere," he said of the 
neighborhood near the intersection of Brooklyn and Eastern avenues. "It has 
always been that way as far as the gangs were concerned. They kind of left this 
area alone because it was like nobody's territory. 
</P>
<P>
"One (gang's) territory begins over there around Eastern and there's another 
that starts at the top of the hill and another when you cross Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
"It was never a completely peaceful place, but it was this little island when I 
was growing up. It's starting to deteriorate now. Things are starting to creep 
up on it a little bit. About the only thing that is left here is a lot of 
memories." 
</P>
<P>
Many of those memories are musical. 
</P>
<P>
"There was always music at the house," Perez said, while his mother prepared 
chiles rellenos for him and Hidalgo in the kitchen. "My mom was really into 
music. When I was about 8 or 9, she used to drag my sister and myself to 
downtown L.A. to these Mexican variety shows." 
</P>
<P>
The four original members of Los Lobos (saxophonist Steve Berlin joined the 
group in the '80s) were friends at Garfield High School, but were in separate 
rock bands until getting together in the early '70s. Disillusioned by only 
being able to play Top 40 hits at clubs and dances with their bands, the four 
friends began exploring acoustic Mexican music in their off hours at the Perez 
house. 
</P>
<P>
They enjoyed it so much -- and found such a positive reaction to it -- that 
they switched styles, playing hundreds of weddings and dances between 1974 and 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, however, Los Lobos got caught up in the energy and imagination that 
was being generated by such rock bands as X and the Blasters on the Hollywood 
club circuit, and the group shifted to rock. 
</P>
<P>
There were other bands on the scene with a Latino connection, including the 
Plugz and Los Illegals, but none offered the originality and imagination of Los 
Lobos' cross-cultural vision. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people warned us that we'd never be accepted in the Hollywood rock 
clubs," Hidalgo said. "And other people used to tell us how they liked our 
music better before we started playing the Hollywood clubs." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't buy it," Perez said. "The idea that there were boundaries or 
limitations because we were from East Los Angeles or there might be some racial 
problem," he said. "It's real easy for people to just kind of put themselves 
into this psychological gridlock. . . . Like, 'You're stuck here and there is 
nothing you can do about it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The early shows had the relaxed, good-natured feel of a neighborhood block 
party. But gradually, an undercurrent of social commentary began to surface and 
the group stepped up to an entire new creative level. 
</P>
<P>
A turning point was 1984's "Will the Wolf Survive?," a song of hope from the 
group's second Slash album. 
</P>
<P>
Sample lyrics: 
</P>
<P>
 All alone in a world that's changed 
</P>
<P>
 Running scared now forced to hide 
</P>
<P>
 In a land where he once stood with pride 
</P>
<P>
 But he'll find his way by the morning light 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by the strong response to "Wolf," Perez and Hidalgo began 
concentrating more fully on social themes in the stirring "By the Light of the 
Moon" album. 
</P>
<P>
Though part of the power of the music was in its reflection of a barrio 
experience, the songs were written with a universality that made them odes to 
people anywhere who cling to their ideals and faith in the face of handicaps 
and social adversity. 
</P>
<P>
The memories at Perez's house aren't all musical. 
</P>
<P>
Before heading inside for lunch, Perez saw two youngsters walking down the 
street, pulling a wagon, and remembered his own childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some things you learn real quickly as a little kid riding your bike 
. . . like where you can go without running into gangs or trouble. . . . But 
there are other things that take you years to figure out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Like, I could never understand why all those women were in the building around 
the corner. . . . 150 sewing machines in there. It was a sweatshop. It just 
didn't seem right, but you didn't know why. Those are some of the things we 
explore now in our music." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Perez and Hidalgo used the image of a sweatshop worker in "One Time, 
One Night," on the last album, and there are other images of the neighborhood 
in some of the songs on the new album. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't set out to call the album 'The Neighborhood,' " Perez said. "It (the 
title song) was one of the last songs we wrote for the album and it seemed to 
tie things together. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a song about urban decay and drugs and everything. . . . About the way 
each person in a family is affected by the pressures of the inner city." 
</P>
<P>
Perez lives with his wife and three sons (ages 14, 5 and 1) about 15 minutes 
away in Whittier, and he's planning to move his mother closer to him. (Hidalgo 
also lives in Whittier, while Rosas lives in Rowland Heights, Lozano lives in 
Walnut and Berlin makes his home near Seattle.) Most of her old friends in the 
neighborhood have either moved or died, and the bars on the windows underscore 
his concern about increased crime in the area. Meanwhile, he stops by often to 
say hello or have lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the darkness in the song "The Neighborhood," there is also an ultimate 
sense of optimism -- a faith in the resilience of people: 
</P>
<P>
Like the smallest rose 
</P>
<P>
Out of the hardest ground 
</P>
<P>
Like a tiny hand 
</P>
<P>
Reaching up for the sun ... 
</P>
<P>
Let's hope our hearts are one. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get away from the usual news of gang violence and drive-bys and 
everything else, but there's no reason to lose hope," Perez said. "And that's 
what we do in our music. We try to be constructive, give people some of that 
hope." 
</P>
<P>
Perez paused once more, digging deeper into the band's philosophy and past. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to make a decision a long time ago . . . whether to just be a good sock 
hop band or something more," he said. "And I think the answer to that question 
had a lot to do with where we came from. . . . This neighborhood."
