ROCK AS IT NEARS 40: RUNNING ON EMPTY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am a 16-year-old who likes classic rock, especially Paul McCartney's and 
David Bowie's. But I also enjoy such recent groups as Depeche Mode and Ziggy 
Marley. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a bad idea for David Bowie to vow to never sing any of his old hits 
in concert again. If I paid to see Bowie or McCartney or any other of the "10 
artists who should follow the lead of David Bowie," as stated in Hilburn's 
article, I would definitely want to see them perform some of their old, classic 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the recent works of these artists are great too. But what would a 
McCartney concert be without an old Beatles tune, or a Bowie concert without 
something from his Ziggy Stardust days, or even a Prince concert without 
"Little Red Corvette"?
