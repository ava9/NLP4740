THE ULTIMATE VALENTINE'S DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Did you remember the roses? How about the truffles? Champagne, too? 
</P>
<P>
Now that the eyes, nose and taste buds are covered, how about a Valentine's Day 
present for the ears, the mind and, perhaps, even the soul of the one you love? 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, Calendar writers asked Orange County arts mavens to count 
the ways that great artistic creations -- the sweetest pop songs, the most 
touching classical music, the most poetic plays -- figure into this day that 
honors love and romance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

human emotions than his. Overture to "The Marriage of Figaro"; "Haffner" 
Symphony (No. 35); Adagio from the Divertimento No. 15 (K. 287). Also, the

<P>
Theater 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Rowe, artistic director of the Laguna Playhouse in Laguna Beach: 
</P>
<P>
"Elizabeth the Queen" by Maxwell Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
We'll be doing the play next year. It's about how the leadership of the Western 
world is set aside for the sake of romance. Essex gives up his career and his 
life for a woman who is very obviously his senior, Queen Elizabeth. It has 
beautiful, romantic language as well. It speaks poetry. 
</P>
<P>
"Cyrano de Bergerac" by Edmond Rostand. 
</P>
<P>
This is an obvious choice. Again, love is shown to be the pre-eminent impulse 
in life. 
</P>
<P>
"Play It Again, Sam" by Woody Allen. 
</P>
<P>
This choice comes to mind because of how I met my wife, Katherine. On closing 
night of ("Sam") we fell in love at the cast party. I had wandered into the 
empty theater feeling the usual post-partum depression. The set was down, and 
there was a cherry picker in the middle of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
I climbed into the cherry picker and pressed the button. On the way up I began 
reciting the nose speech from "Cyrano": "The face that launched a thousand 
ships and burned the topless towers Illium. . . . These are the things you 
might have said had you some tinge of letters or of wit." 
</P>
<P>
When I got to the top of this 20-foot arc, I was finishing up the speech, and I 
took off my hat and sailed it into the empty theater. Katherine had walked in 
without my knowing, and sat down and -- this is a true story -- my hat landed 
in her lap. 
</P>
<P>
Well, she jumped up and said, "I want to have your child!" A year later we were 
married. We now have two kids. I guess she got more than she bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas F. Bradac, artistic director of the Grove Theatre Company in Garden 
Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"Romeo and Juliet" by William Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
This play is about the passion of young love and the blindness of doing 
anything for love. 
</P>
<P>
"Cyrano de Bergerac." 
</P>
<P>
"Cyrano" is about unrequited love, the pure love of giving oneself for the love 
of another. 
</P>
<P>
"Venus and Adonis" by Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a play, it's an epic poem. But we presented it in a dramatic 
one-man version last summer. It's very passionate and sexual. 
</P>
<P>
The interesting thing is that all of these choices have tragic endings. You 
don't walk off into the sunset hand in hand in any of them. You pay for love. 
</P>
<P>
"Two Gentlemen of Verona" by Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
I would choose this one for silly romance. . . . We all are a little silly when 
we fall in love. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Cohen, chairman of the UC Irvine drama department: 
</P>
<P>
"Much Ado About Nothing" by Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
This is the most romantic play ever written. It's a very modern play about the 
crisis of love. How do you balance the privacy of the individual and the need 
for love and companionship? How do you have both? That is what Benedick and 
Beatrice and Claudio and Hero are trying to do. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Benson, artistic director of South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa: 
</P>
<P>
"The Playboy of the Western World" by John Millington Synge. 
</P>
<P>
To me, this is the most romantic play of all time. It is gorgeous stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"Cyrano de Bergerac." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to go wrong with that one. 
</P>
<P>
"Romeo and Juliet." 
</P>
<P>
It captures people falling in love -- the "limmerance," if you will. 
</P>
<P>
David Emmes, producting artistic director of SCR: 
</P>
<P>
"Cyrano de Bergerac." 
</P>
<P>
I put "Cyrano" in a class by itself because of its great lyricism and because 
of the non-demanding, selfless love that we see manifest there. 
</P>
<P>
A distant second and third are "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (by Shakespeare) and 
"Fool for Love" (by Sam Shepard). "Midsummer Night's Dream," because it is 
about youthful, exuberant love and sexual awakening. "Fool for Love" because, 
in its bizarre way, it is about consuming, compelling visceral love, an almost 
ineffable love. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Terry, artistic director of the Alternative Repertory Theatre in Santa Ana: 
</P>
<P>
"The Eagle With Two Heads" by Jean Cocteau. 
</P>
<P>
The two characters would rather be dead than not be in love. They want an 
idealistic understanding. The language is beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
"Much Ado About Nothing" and "Cyrano de Bergerac," of course, would be my 
classical selections. 
</P>
<P>
For a contemporary choice I would say Tom Stoppard's "The Real Thing" because 
it grasps the modern dilemma of falling out of love with your spouse and 
falling in love with someone else, and all the pain and guilt that accompanies 
that.
