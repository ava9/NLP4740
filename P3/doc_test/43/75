Not much has been heard from singer Don McLean since his big hit in 1971, 
"American Pie," but he's working on a comeback. An album titled "Headroom" will 
be released in the fall; it deals with topics ranging from kids watching too 
much television to the public's embrace of style over substance.

After the short-lived success of "American Pie," McLean says he no longer wants 
to be a star. "When you're really hot, it's dangerous," he said. "Back then, I 
recall it being quite unpleasant. I didn't commit suicide and I didn't go into 
bankruptcy, but it was quite a swim upstream until I got my bearing."

<P>
Nonetheless, he's pleased that he made his mark. "('American Pie' is) not just 
another song I wrote, that's for sure," McLean said. "It's a folk song. It 
belongs to the people. If children keep singing it, it will be around for ever, 
long after I'm dead."
