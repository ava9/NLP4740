'EARTH GIRLS': THROUGH THE EYES OF EXTRATERRESTRIALS

"Earth Girls Are Easy" (citywide) takes place in Los Angeles, but it's L.A. 
through cracked sunglasses with purple stardust frizzies on the lens. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is a jazzy, snazzy rock-musical comedy about a dumped-on Valley Girl 
who ushers three girl-crazy extraterrestrials around town after they crash-land 
in her swimming pool. And its virtuoso director, Julien Temple ("Absolute 
Beginners"), turns Los Angeles into a candy-frosted, slick dream mall, where 
Melrose Avenue, the San Fernando Valley and Ocean Avenue seem to have swallowed 
up everything. 
</P>
<P>
The city is creamed over visually with Temple's wit and impudence. He's like a 
guy who dreamed up Los Angeles out of TV and movies and then went out and found 
all the places he dreamed: found the nutty drive-ins, goofball specialty shops, 
the huge plaster doughnuts, the palm trees slashing the smoggy sky. He's even 
found Angelyne, the puffy-bosomed blonde in lavender sunglasses whose only 
raison d'etre seemed to be her omnipresent L.A. billboards -- she pops up here 
as a sultry bimbo in a BMW. 
</P>
<P>
It's the look of the movie, supposedly filtered through alien eyes, that's 
special. But the core of "Earth Girls" is too easy: slick fluff that's been 
ingeniously lacquered over, a mix of Valley Girl shop-and-chop sarcasm and 
cutie-pie sci-fi effects with the laid-back, benignly trashy mood of an old 
beach party musical. 
</P>
<P>
The script and four songs were co-written by Julie Brown, MTV's resident 
put-down specialist, as a vehicle for herself. Instead, Brown's part, Valerie 
the dippy manicurist, went to Geena Davis, with Brown recast as her girlfriend, 
boss of the Curl Up and Dye hair salon. The rest of the cast is equally 
anachronistic: Michael McKean as a burnt-out surfer and pool cleaner; Jeff 
Goldblum, Jim Carrey and Damon Wayans as the aliens from Jhazzalan, and 
ex-"Saturday Night Live" bad-mouth Charlie Rocket, as Valerie's faithless 
boyfriend, looking something like Dan Quayle as a sour-faced yuppie swinger. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's songs are cute; as Temple stages and shoots them, they're the high 
spots of the movie. But the movie is a weird hybrid. The visual satire is 
ingenious and even entrancing, like an old '50s Frank Tashlin comedy or a 
musical number by Stanley Donen and Bob Fosse. But the verbal humor has a mean, 
sluggy tartness, like the condescending cracks of rich kids at the hicko 
culture of the local styleless boobs. 
</P>
<P>
Temple has a weakness for this kind of humor; he's a wealthy Cambridge boy who 
must have liked the punks and rockers for their freedom and contempt for 
authority. But, sometimes, he seems to lack the real populist flair that a 
pop-music specialist needs, and this may be why, except for his superb rock 
videos, he hasn't caught the public fancy yet. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, though, the visuals triumph. "Earth Girls Are Easy" may be a 
classic case of a director getting more out of his material than it really 
deserves. Temple has spectacular gifts for making musical movies. He is a witty 
formalist, a light-hearted virtuoso, and, like all the best movie-musical 
directors, he's able to create images that breathe in tempo with the songs or 
cut against them jaggedly, exhilaratingly. 
</P>
<P>
There is one terrific example of that here: " 'Cause I'm a Blonde," a 
bimbos-on-the-beach satirical number in which Julie Brown redeems herself for 
all the script's lazy one-liners and its paucity of invention and real style. 
She gives the number a languorous, wooly-headed self-infatuated buzz, and 
Temple makes the air around her crackle. "Earth Girls Are Easy" (MPAA rated PG, 
despite sexual innuendo and partial nudity) may be the weakest piece of 
material Temple has had to work with, but he transforms it anyway. In his 
hands, the whole style of this movie becomes an apotheosis of glitz.MICHAEL
