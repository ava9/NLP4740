BACK in 1981 when Mrs Margaret Thatcher first pushed for the abolition of
domestic rates, Mr Michael Heseltine offered a simple solution to her most
pressing concern.
The then environment secretary told the then prime minister that if her main
worry was the high bills faced by little old ladies living alone in large
houses, the answer was simple. He would make local authorities give them a
big discount.
The rest is history. Mrs Thatcher did not take his advice. Mr Heseltine
moved on and then out of the Cabinet. The prime minister solved her problem
by replacing the rates with the poll tax. Mr Heseltine pushed her out of
Downing Street.
Today Mr Heseltine, back at environment under a new prime minister, will
outline his plan to replace the poll tax with a property tax which provides
a 25 per cent discount to little old ladies living alone in large houses.
The important details have already emerged; and despite of talk of further
consultation, the scheme will represent a firm proposal rather than an
option.
At first glance it looks a neat synthesis of political imperatives and
economic logic, though the realistic in Whitehall are still unsure of how
strong the joins are.
The tax will be levied on property classified in seven bands according to
capital value. Bills will be applied to households - with an assumption that
they contain two adults - rather than to individuals. The poorest will be
exempted entirely.
The present system of grant distribution using Standard Spending Assessments
will remain as will draconian 'capping' powers to prevent 'excessive'
spending by local authorities. There is little talk nowadays of preserving
'local democracy'.
The economic logic is there in the fact that a property tax restores some
relationship between individual wealth and the size of bills. The Duke in
his stately home will pay more than the dustman in his council flat. The
Treasury, which has always regarded property values as a reasonable proxy
for income, is satisfied. So too are the politicians who can claim this
makes the tax 'fair', or at least much fairer than the poll tax. All single
adults, including the famous little old lady, will get a 25 per cent
discount.
The political compromise reveals itself in the decision to compress and then
'cap' the increases in bills which can be applied to the different bands.
The government will set the bands nationally along with strict 'multipliers'
to regulate the proportion of revenue raised from properties in each
category.
Most importantly, the bill for a house worth, say, Pounds 1m or more in band
7 will not be more than 2.5 times higher than for the flat worth Pounds
40,000 in band 1. So the system will be progressive - about 90 per cent of
households will be unaffected by the 'cap' on band 7 - but, like the present
income tax structure, only up to a point.
Mr Heseltine hopes this compromise will calm Tory fears that a return to any
property tax would automatically create a swathe of 'losers' in the south.
The Budget switch of more than Pounds 4bn of local taxation to VAT should
ensure that average bills across the country should not be much more than
Pounds 350 per household. The multipliers will prevent councils from loading
the burden on to southern Tory voters who have benefited from the sharp rise
in property values over the past decade.
Bills for similar properties will not be identical across the country. A
three-bedroom semi in London will typically be in a higher band that a
similar house in Barnsley, so will attract a higher bill. The Treasury
thinks it should - incomes are higher in London than Barnsley. But the
politicians will control the size of the differential.
It all looks ingenious, and ministers are convinced that it will work. This
time, they insist, the Treasury is fully behind the new system. It has been
tested on the computers in Great George Street as well as those in Marsham
Street.
There is even a fig-leaf for those still wedded to the principle that all
should contribute to the cost of local services. Mr Heseltine will argue
that the two-person household assumed by the tax will capture 38m of the 42m
adults theoretically liable to pay the poll.
There is still, though, one serious weakness. Whatever the initial level of
bills, the commitment to the Uniform Business Rate means that any local tax
will be highly 'geared'. A 10 per cent rise in spending beyond that allowed
for in government grant would produce a 70 per cent rise in bills. More than
one senior minister is convinced that the UBR cannot survive in its present
form. But talk of raising the tax burden on industry is for after, not
before, the general election.
