"The Warrior Queens," Antonia Fraser's most recent historical essay, is 
lore-packed, quirky in its approach, and fascinating to read. If nonfiction 
books can be thought of as detailed answers to unvoiced questions, then the 
question answered by this one is: How have female political and military 
leaders gotten away with it? How have they managed to fob themselves off on 
those hardest to convince -- soldiers and other politicians, those 
quintessentially male devisers and players of boys' games -- as worthy leaders 
of the charge or captains of the ship of state, although long of hair and bulgy 
of breast? Such women have been few enough in number so that the exceptions 
have very much proven the rule. But what about those exceptions? What was their 
strategy, their sleight-of-hand? What was their secret? 
</P>
<P>
In pursuit of answers, Fraser has assembled a remarkable group of women for our 
contemplation. She begins with Boadicea herself, that famed but shadowy 
1st-Century British tribal queen who led a revolt against the occupying and 
oppressive Romans, massacred a lot of them, and was said to have committed 
suicide when her forces were massacred in return. Fraser provides as faithful 
an account of the events as is possible, given that information is scarce and 
reports vary. But she is just as interested in Boadicea's metamorphoses in 
historical and literary accounts through the ages -- from pious patriot and 
martyr, mother of her people, to unwomanly, bloodthirsty shrew, to symbol of 
heroic British imperialism, ironic in view of the fact that her own revolt was 
against an earlier imperialism. The accounts of her have varied according to 
what men considered proper womanly behavior, and to what the British considered 
proper British behavior; thus Boadicea has been both slut and saint. Very early 
on, the myth detached itself from the real woman in question, and has been 
floating around ever since, ready to stick itself like a leech to any woman 
hardy enough to brandish a spear or declare for office. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser follows up with a varied assortment of women from many centuries and 
civilizations who have held, however briefly, the reins of power: Zenobia, the 
3rd-Century Queen of Palmyra who also challenged Roman rule; Empress Maud, of 
the 12th-Century English wars of succession; Queen Tamara of Georgia, "The Lion 
of the Caucasus"; Elizabeth I, inspiring her troops to battle the Spanish 
Armada; Isabella of Spain; the engaging Queen Jinga of Angola, who successfully 
defied the Portuguese colonists; Catherine the Great of Russia; the Vietnamese 
heroines, Trung Trac and Trung Nhi; the amazing Rani of Jhansi, who fought the 
British in India; Indira Gandhi, Golda Meir, and a good many more, concluding 
with that handy bookend to Boadicea, Margaret Thatcher. Their childhoods, their 
paths to leadership, and their styles vary enormously, but they have one thing 
in common: All were instantly mythologized. Male military leaders, taken for 
all in all, have been men, and that has been enough; but female ones cannot be 
mere women. They are aberrations, and as such are thought to partake of the 
supernatural or the monstrous: angels or devils, paragons of chastity or demons 
of lust, Whores of Babylon or Iron Maidens. Sometimes they have profited from 
the female saints or goddesses available to them through their cultures, 
sometimes they have had to work against such images. Their femininity has been 
both shackle and banner. 
</P>
<P>
As leaders, they have had to be, like female doctors a decade ago, better than 
men. They have shamed their male followers by displaying superior courage; they 
have shamed their male adversaries by inflicting defeat on them at the hands of 
a mere woman. They have outmaneuvered, outtalked, outblustered, and in some 
cases outshot and outridden the cream of the male crop. Altogether they are an 
impressive lot, and Fraser is to be congratulated for rescuing them from their 
own myths and for giving them their due as individuals, the lesser-known among 
them as well as the household words. 
</P>
<P>
But although they have been trotted out like a roll call by many advocates for 
the equality of women, and presented in many guises -- from turn-of-the-century 
pageants to Judy Chicago's "Dinner Party" -- these women have seldom allied 
themselves with women in general, or with movements for the improvement of 
their lot. More typically, they have distanced themselves from women, like 
Elizabeth I, who was against female rule but saw herself as a divinely placed 
exception, or like Catherine the Great, who spoke of the "weak, frivolous, 
whining species of women." Many have preferred the status of honorary males. If 
you're playing boys' games, you need to be one of the boys. 
</P>
<P>
This book should be required reading for any woman going into politics, 
truck-driving or the Army; indeed, by any woman going into anything, unless her 
chosen field is uniquely feminine. Public women are put through different tests 
of nerve, attract different kinds of criticism, and are subject to different 
sorts of mythologizing than are men, and "The Warrior Queens' " indicates what 
kinds. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us for whom politics is a spectator sport will find it useful, too. It 
goes a long way toward explaining the various media transformations of, for 
instance, Margaret Thatcher, from her Attila-the-Hen period through her 
Iron-Maiden-Falkland-War phase to her incarnation as an editorial-cartoon 
Boadicea, complete with whip and chariot, triumphant on election day and 
dragging a clutch of pygmy men in her wake. Women leaders, it seems, find it 
difficult to be life-sized. For good or ill, they are gigantic.
