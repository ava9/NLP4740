BRITISH elections grab the attention of continental Europeans more than
theirs interest the British. This is probably a result of the oddities, and
of what are seen as failings, of the British electoral system: the bogus
drama of setting the date, the difficulty of predicting the number of seats
that each party can win because of the random nature of the
first-past-the-post system; and the constitutional theatre that an election
involves. It all seems a bit like cricket - and a bit of a gamble.
Thus, in Die Welt, Reiner Gatermann started by quoting the 'vote-guru,'
David Butler: 'The Conservatives are three-to-two, Labour three-to-one.' The
headline was 'April 9 means the end of Kinnock or Major.'
Gatermann pondered the closeness of the race: 'Kinnock's supporters must
wonder why their party cannot make more political capital out of the failure
of the long-promised recovery to arrive and the widespread dissatisfaction
with Tory policy in health and education - and finally the poll tax
disaster. But they really know the reason: it is called Neil Kinnock.'
He concludes that people just cannot see Kinnock as prime minister - 'He has
that image ascribed to the Welsh - saying too little with too many words.'
European correspondents based in London do not like Kinnock because, they
say, he turns down one-to-one interviews with them and they are banned from
the main floor at Labour Party conferences.
However, they do not seem to admire the government much, either. In the
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Jochen Rudolph discussed last week's Budget:
'The history of British policy teaches that incorrect fiscal policy causes a
lot of trouble . . . To steer with fiscal means makes it essential to know
where the economy stands, where it can be measured. But the experience of
the last two years, at least in England, is that the experts always diagnose
falsely, and as a result make incorrect forecasts - the Treasury included.'
Traditionally it has been only the Germans who adopt a high-handed, didactic
tone when dealing with British failings. But since France became a pillar of
financial rectitude, the attitude has spread. La Tribune de l'Expansion had
an editorial on the Budget which accused John Major of being a Keynesian. It
was horrified by the Pounds 28bn deficit: 'In an open economy it is not by
digging deficits that one emerges from the swamp.'
Over at Les Echos, Patrick de Jacquelot takes a more tolerant, often
fatalistic, view. He developed an old theme of his regarding the problems
facing the Tories. The Budget was badly received by the public; that alarmed
the City; which in turn could affect the pound, 'aggravating thereby the
difficulties of the government. There is therefore the risk of a vicious
circle which must make the Conservatives shiver . . . '
To de Jacquelot, the electoral question could be put quite simply: 'Would
the improvement of public services and social welfare justify higher
government spending and taxes?'
In the Milan daily, Il Sole-24 Ore, Alessandro Merli saw the problem as
being mainly one for the Tories: 'After the years of the Micawberesque
fiscal virtue of Margaret Thatcher, who set about repaying the whole of the
public debt thanks to the boom and the proceeds of privatisation . . . the
last two years have seen a sudden change in the trend. Not only has Major
wanted to show a 'compassionate' side of Conservatism, thus increasing
public spending, but the recession has meant a hard blow to tax receipts.'
Merli's views prefigured much British comment.
But for real disdain one has to return, as always, to the Frankfurter
Allgemeine. It noted that Major had not been able to make much use of his
freedom to choose the date - 'it could have been foreseen that the economic
situation would not change.' But it was also the one paper I read that made
much of that woman whom we all seem to have forgotten:
'Things would be easier if Major had to deal only with his Labour rival,
Kinnock. But the person he has to measure himself against is Mrs Thatcher.
Her legacy is double-edged: there is the image of the 'Iron Lady' who
improved Britain's reputation in the world and broke through the blockades
in the economy and society. But there is also the picture, formed during the
last phase in Thatcher's period in office, which shows a self-admiring
autocrat who had lost any notion of the needs of simple people.'
In this welter of not very admiring comment it was nice to read Fabrice
Rousselot in Liberation. At least someone thought something good was
happening in Britain: 'This unpredictable election is in the image of a
changing British political landscape. The vote of April 9 could for the
first time smash the traditional 'Labour-Tory' polarisation and open the way
to a broader political scene, more consensual and less marked
ideologically.'
Somebody could also have said that Britain's is the only political landscape
in Europe where we are not watching the rise of something nasty on the far
right. But nobody over there seems to have noticed that.
