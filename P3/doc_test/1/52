FT  28 OCT 93 / Observer: Economic with reality
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharp brains at the Institute of Economic Affairs - the think-tank that
lays claim to providing Margaret Thatcher with many of her policies from the
abolition of rent controls to the contracting out of council services - are
cut to the quick.
In the 914 pages of the first volume of the Lady's biography, The Downing
Street Years, the institute detects not a single mention of itself. Nor does
the 27-page index list Lord Harris or Arthur Seldon, the two men credited
with inventing Thatcherism at a time when Margaret Hilda Roberts was still
bending her mind to the properties of hydro-carbons.
Good thing a second volume is planned.
