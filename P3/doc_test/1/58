THATCHER'S RESIGNATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It certainly wasn't Thatcherism that pulled Britain up by its bootstraps (front 
page, Nov. 23) but oil found off the coast of Scotland, which became a godsend 
for the ailing British economy and other maladies, and which made Britain an 
oil exporting country.

<P>
Furthermore, now that the Iron Lady is gone and no longer a stumbling block 
toward European mutual understanding, the Continent at last can say, "Good 
riddance," unity is now at hand.
