THATCHER'S WOES BOOST SPECULATION: WILL SHE 'CRACK' UNDER THE HEAT?;

<P>
A subtle but significant change has crept into the seemingly incessant 
speculation here about Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's political future. 
</P>
<P>
While the focus has previously been on such outward signs of her problems as 
plummeting popularity ratings and humiliating anti-government demonstrations, 
it now seems increasingly to deal with her state of mind. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Parliament member from Thatcher's own Conservative Party volunteered 
at the end of an interview the other day that he thinks the British government 
can still turn its fortunes around "if she keeps her nerve." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking between hors d'oeuvres at a cocktail party, an admiring Western 
diplomat said the main, near-term question about the prime minister is whether 
she will "crack." 
</P>
<P>
And even one of her aides conceded that a much discussed scenario has her so 
overcome by depression at the state of her administration that she resigns. 
</P>
<P>
The aide quickly dismissed that possibility. "We're not for mid-term cracking!" 
he assured. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, few claim to see any obvious signs that Thatcher is buckling under the 
political pressure. And she makes light of such suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not come here to retire," she assured party stalwarts with a smile in 
the opening lines of an address shortly after her party suffered a stunning 
defeat in a parliamentary by-election. 
</P>
<P>
In a luncheon speech to the Scottish Distillers' Assn. not long before, she 
said: "As I come up to the 11th anniversary as prime minister (May 4), I take 
great comfort from the fact that malt whiskies reach their full maturity only 
in the 12th year -- and after that, there is a premium in their price and their 
value." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the fact that even one of her closest Tory collaborators would call into 
question her nerve is a remarkable change in the image of the woman Moscow once 
dubbed the "Iron Lady." Skeptics may have doubted whether Thatcher was skilled 
enough to control the fire, but until now they seldom suggested that she 
couldn't stand the heat. 
</P>
<P>
The change occurs on the eve of a summit meeting with President Bush in Bermuda 
today that should theoretically provide a welcome reprieve. Leaders the world 
over count on high-visibility foreign forays to deflect attention from domestic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
This visit, however, seems to be generating more British press comment about 
Thatcher's allegedly diminished role on the world stage. It hasn't diverted 
attention from her troubles at home; it threatens to compound them. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 14 months since Mr. Bush's inauguration, the balance of Atlantic and 
European power has shifted quite dramatically," wrote Peter Jenkins, a widely 
read political columnist for The Independent newspaper. "The Soviet Union has 
become a less formidable adversary; Germany -- about to be united -- the 
dominant Western European power, while Britain has looked increasingly isolated 
from the mainstream of international developments. This has diminished Mrs. 
Thatcher's usefulness to Washington." 
</P>
<P>
The press here has also picked up the psychological theme. 
</P>
<P>
The relatively pro-Thatcher Sunday Times editorialized the other day that she 
"is clearly entering a night of the soul." The Independent ran a lengthy piece 
of commentary on "what makes prime ministers give up the ghost." 
</P>
<P>
Several papers have probed the possible psychological implications of new, 
10-foot high gates that now block the end of Downing Street, where No. 10 is 
Thatcher's official residence. One psychiatrist was quoted as saying that the 
person so protected must feel "an enormous sense of isolation and betrayal at 
the hands of people who had failed to be grateful for years of selfless public 
service." 
</P>
<P>
Probably more pertinent is that a Thatcher abdication seems the only likely way 
this government will change before the next general election, scheduled for 
mid-1992. With a 98-seat majority in Parliament, her Tory party doesn't have to 
worry about votes of confidence in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, she could face a leadership challenge from within her party 
that, if successful, would also force her out of No. 10. A Sunday Times poll of 
100 Conservative members of Parliament last month found one in four saying that 
Thatcher should stand down before the next election. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no clear-cut successor, and a possibly bitter struggle to replace 
her could damage the party badly. Former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine 
appears to be the front-runner in any succession race, but former party 
chairman and spokesman of the party's right wing, Norman Tebbit, has pledged to 
fight rather than see Heseltine take over. 
</P>
<P>
"The scenario I think is quite likely is that when she becomes convinced that 
she'll lose the next election, she'll go quietly," commented author and 
political scientist Anthony Sampson. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher is now the most unpopular prime minister since Gallup began polling 
here 50 years ago, with only one in four Britons approving of the job she is 
doing. All the polls show the Conservatives trailing the arch-rival Labor Party 
by at least 20 points, with the gap widening. 
</P>
<P>
Sampson speculated that Thatcher may step down voluntarily before next fall's 
annual Conservative Party convention. She could "go in a respectable way by 
using Denis (her husband) as a pretext," he added. Denis Thatcher is 10 years 
older than the prime minister, who will be 65 in October. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher insists she intends to run for a fourth term. And her strategists 
present a cogent case that she could still pull it off. 
</P>
<P>
They concede that the economy, an issue that has helped her tremendously in 
past elections, has turned sour, with interest rates at a punishing 15% and the 
latest inflation figures, released Thursday, showing prices headed upward at 
more than an 8% annual rate. However, her strategists see a turnaround by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
By then they hope that a combination of time and tinkering will have made the 
highly unpopular "poll tax" for local government services more acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Even under that scenario, however, a harsh test of the "Iron Lady's" mettle is 
likely over the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives face a drubbing in local elections scheduled for May 3. The 
initial installment payments are due on the new "poll tax" later this month, 
and soon opponents of the levy promise that a boycott campaign will force the 
government either to back off or start throwing ordinary people into jail. 
Neither option would do much for Thatcher's popularity. 
</P>
<P>
As The Economist weekly put it the other day: "The idea that Mrs. Margaret 
Thatcher may no longer be prime minister by the autumn must now be taken 
seriously."
