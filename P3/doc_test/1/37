FT  08 OCT 92 / Observer: European scoop
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lady Thatcher's choice of The European for her onslaught on the government's
European policy seems a trifle bizarre.
After all, the weekly paper is supposed to be championing European unity,
not helping destroy it. It wouldn't have happened when Euro-buff Cap'n Bob
Maxwell was at the helm, that's for sure.
On the other hand, there must have been plenty of Fleet Street Knights who'd
have jumped at the chance of publishing the attack. The European's editor
Charles Garside insists that it was nothing less than a well planned scoop.
Lady T had written for his paper once before, and he asked her some time ago
to pen her latest essay.
He also denies that it had anything to do with the paper's new owners, the
reclusive Barclay twins, who are great admirers of the former prime
minister. Unlike Maxwell, the present proprietors do not interfere, and
Garside says that his paper is far more independent than it used to be. He's
keen to publish all shades of opinion. A fortnight ago, he gave EC president
Jacques Delors his head.
Whatever the reason for her choice, one of the more refreshing qualities of
the iron lady is that she so often operates outside the established
channels. Good for her, and well done The European.
