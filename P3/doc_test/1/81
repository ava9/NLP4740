<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush met today with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, conferring 
about new pressures sparked by sweeping changes in Europe and helping the 
embattled British leader shore up her image at home. 
</P>
<P>
In more than six hours of talks at the storm-swept island resort, the two 
leaders sat down for their sixth meeting to discuss the rapid moves toward 
German reunification and the ramifications for continuing arms control 
negotiations and the future of superpower relations. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Bush, speaking to reporters en route to the conference, said 
he viewed "as positive" statements from Moscow predicting that a strategic 
nuclear arms reduction pact will be ready to approve by the time Bush meets 
next month with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"What (Gorbachev) said about instructing his people to go forward, I viewed 
that as a very positive statement, and we're sending the same signals to our 
negotiators," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the President said that despite Thatcher's plummeting popularity 
at home and her battles on a variety of domestic political fronts, he continued 
to appreciate her insight and he restated the importance of the U.S.-British 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very close together on our assessment on the changes that are taking 
place inside the Soviet Union. . . . She has a very clear view of the realities 
of the world," Bush said. White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater 
described the first two hours of talks as "warm and productive." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Bush and Thatcher have "mutually supportive views" on a wide 
range of issues, including Eastern Europe, Gorbachev's confrontation with the 
breakaway republic of Lithuania and apparent attempts by Iraq to acquire parts 
for dangerous and powerful weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings were broken up by a good deal of pomp, circumstance and food. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Bush was greeted with military fanfare and a blustery wind 
and overcast skies. After a working lunch, he was to join Thatcher and a group 
of children in Bermuda's custom of marking Good Friday by flying colorful 
kites.
