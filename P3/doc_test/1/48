FIGHTING ALL THE WAY by Barbara Castle Macmillan Pounds 20, 626 pages
BARBARA CASTLE was the Labour Party's Margaret Thatcher, or should have
been. They have different beliefs and Mrs Castle never even became party
leader, let alone prime minister. Yet in character and background they have
a great deal in common. Even in their politics they have a shared suspicion
of the European Community.
Mrs Castle's misfortune was to have been born too early - four years before
the outbreak of the first world war. There was never a chance that a woman
could make it to the very top in her generation, especially in the Labour
Party. When she was seeking to become a parliamentary candidate in the early
1940s, an old trade union hand told her bluntly: 'Women won't vote for
women.' Still, it is possible that Mrs Castle's pioneering in one party made
it easier for Mrs Thatcher in another.
Barbara Betts, as she was born, owed a lot to her father, who worked for the
inland revenue but was also a socialist intellectual who wrote poems. The
north country family was not well off. Like Margaret Roberts from Grantham
she went to Oxford at a time when that was relatively unusual for a girl
from a poor background. With her customary flexibility, Mrs Castle believes
that once women had achieved equality - such as being allowed to speak at
the union and have wine at dinner - there was no need for mixed colleges.
The length and depth of her political training are remarkable. After what
she regarded as the shame of an Oxford third, she went in for party
propaganda, being proclaimed in Ashton-under-Lyne as 'a unique phenomenon -
a woman wot speaks'. She knew most of the leading figures in the party early
on and wrote a joint column in Tribune with Michael Foot. She was already a
figure at party conferences, and had even called for limiting the trade
union block vote, before she entered parliament in 1945. Almost at once she
became a parliamentary private secretary to Stafford Cripps, then to Harold
Wilson.
Those were the liberal days when a PPS was allowed to vote against the
government. By 1950 she was a member of the party's national executive
committee. Probably her closest political ally was Aneurin Bevan, who she
thinks would have had a healthy influence on the left had he not died in
1960. Mrs Castle disliked Hugh Gaitskell intensely, and in the long period
of Labour opposition spent much of her time working with the Movement for
Colonial Freedom - a fascinating part of her memoirs.
Much of the rest of the volume is more familiar, from not only her own
diaries but also those of her colleagues: Wilson, Crossman, Healey, Jenkins
and Benn. She was the first minister for overseas development to be in the
cabinet; the (non-driving) transport minister who introduced seat belts and
breath tests; then she came a cropper with 'In Place of Strife' when
ultimately only Harold Wilson supported her attempts to reform trade union
legislation. She left office completely when Wilson was succeeded as prime
minister by James Callaghan, a man whom she plainly disliked as much as she
had Gaitskell.
Still, some insights are new. She was not conventionally left wing and she
has a nice turn of phrase: on Tony Benn - 'I had an uneasy feeling from time
to time that something was not quite in focus.' She says that her own view
about the Labour Party is like that of the present Bishop of Durham on
Christianity - 'continuing to assert the faith while shedding those
doctrinal elements which no longer seem appropriate.'
I did not know that Mrs Castle wanted to be foreign secretary when Labour
returned in 1974, but that is what she claims. On her desire for the
premiership, she is quite open, yet honest enough to recognise it was not
within her grasp. She never schemed for it. Perhaps her most surprising
characteristic was her total hostility to the European Community in the
years when Britain was seeking to join. There was a mild conversion when she
became a member of the European Parliament in the 1980s, but a pro-European
Castle earlier on might have tilted the balance in the Labour Party.
With these memoirs Mrs Castle is back with the Healeys and the Jenkins which
is where she belongs. She leaves no doubt of her admiration for Mrs
Thatcher's determination, but must be pleased to have got in first. Lady
Thatcher's memoirs are due in the autumn.
