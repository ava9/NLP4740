SHE HAD come to see her friends and support the prime minister. That at
least is what her press secretary said.
Baroness Thatcher yesterday decided that actions speak louder than words as
she arrived to a slightly less than ecstatic welcome from the rank and file
inside the Empress Ballroom. Her presence on the platform, alongside many of
the senior ministers she has purportedly castigated in her memoirs, was
designed to underline her approval for Mr John Major.
But all most people wanted to talk about was what she really thought of her
successor. The extracts in the Daily Mirror newspaper, widely believed,
indicated just what a poor opinion she had of him. Mr Major appeared to
return the compliment when he broke with recent tradition by declining to
kiss her when he joined the platform for the debate on the economy.
If comparing their respective merits as prime minister was not enough,
supporters of each camp immediately began to contrast the standing ovations
given to past and present leaders. At just over two minutes, Lady Thatcher's
ovation was 20 seconds longer than the one given to Mr Major. But only half
the audience were on their feet for the whole two minutes. Sir Edward Heath
appeared scrupulously fair by standing for both but refusing to clap.
There was no shortage of cabinet ministers trying to put the explosive issue
of Lady Thatcher's memoirs behind them. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health
secretary, said the matter was 'history'; Mr Peter Lilley, social security
secretary said Lady Thatcher was 'livid with rage' at the Daily Mirror.
Other representatives of the parliamentary party were more outspoken in
their anger at what they perceived to be Lady Thatcher's hijacking of the
party conference. 'It's a disgraceful lack of self-discipline,' said one.
Her close friends appeared to hark back to a golden age which Mr Major now
says never was. Mr Edward Leigh, the rightwing former trade minister sacked
by the prime minister, said it was ludicrous to blame Lady Thatcher for
stealing Mr Major's thunder. 'There is a tremendous affection for
Thatcherite values. Until we get back to those policies we will continue to
drift.'
Sir Norman Fowler had hoped to appease Lady Thatcher's friends by declaring
that he wore the badge of both Thatcherism and Majorism with pride. But it
failed to convince one minister who said the government had only itself to
blame by trying to distance itself from the achievements of the 1980s.
Sir Tim Bell, who used to advise Lady Thatcher on her public relations,
appeared bemused by the fuss. He professed surprise that anyone could have
failed to see that the conference spotlight would fall on Lady Thatcher.
'What on earth did you expect?'
Not to be outdone by the party chairman, who organised a dinner party for
Lady Thatcher, Sir Tim hosted a lunch for her in the Imperial Hotel. As the
guests made their way to their table they were somewhat taken aback at the
sight of Sir Edward lunching in the middle with Mr Michael Heseltine at
another table on the right.
Mr Heseltine later made a triumphant return to the conference receiving the
third longest standing ovation of the day. Supporters held out letters
spelling 'Tarzan'.
He had timed his entrance perfectly. Lady Thatcher had long since left the
platform. Less than 24 hours after she arrived at Blackpool she strode out
of the hotel lobby. According to one of her luncheon companions she had yet
again demonstrated her support for the prime minister - this time by not
even mentioning him.
