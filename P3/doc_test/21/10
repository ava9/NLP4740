  [Text] Yesterday, Noel Rivas, Nicaraguan ambassador to 
Honduras, said he did not have "concrete information" about the 
U.S. State Department's human rights report indicating members 
of the Nicaraguan counterrevolutionary movement are guilty of 
human rights violations in Honduras. 
  The Nicaraguan diplomat said his country is willing to 
cooperate with Honduras in investigating to what extent the 
statements in the U.S. report are true. He said: "There is 
cooperation between the governments and a common goal, 
therefore, this will be resolved between the two governments." 
  He also said the Honduran Government could make inquiries in 
Nicaragua to clear up the contras' participation in human rights 
violations but "those inquiries must be conducted by mail, with 
help on a judicial and diplomatic level." 
  Explaining the Juan Pablo Cruz Laguna [not further 
identified] murder case, Rivas said the Nicaraguan Government 
"does not expect anything more;" however, a sentence must be 
handed down since right now "a trial is under way." Rivas said: 
"This has to end with a sentence; it must be clear who is 
guilty."
