Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's finance minister, is expected to
resign today in order to run for the presidency later this year. His likely
successor is Mr Rubens Ricupero, a respected diplomat and former ambassador
in Washington.
Mr Cardoso has been strongly pressured by his party, the Brazilian Social
Democrats (PSDB), to run for the presidency, but he is leaving the finance
ministry at a critical moment. An anti-inflation plan he has negotiated
through Congress is not yet fully in force and may be undermined once he
leaves. According to Brazil's constitution, he must resign by April 2 to run
in the October polls.
Financial markets reacted calmly to the expected transition. Mr Ricupero was
not Mr Cardoso's first choice as his replacement, but the former ambassador
has said he supports Mr Cardoso's economic measures. He is also friendly
with several of the leading economists in Mr Cardoso's team.
Mr Ricupero is well versed in economic affairs from his stint in Washington,
where he was involved in Brazil's negotiations with the international
financial community, and in trade matters. He was replaced as ambassador
last year by President Itamar Franco who was annoyed at international
reaction to a massacre of street children in Rio de Janeiro. Since then Mr
Ricupero has worked as minister of the environment with responsibility for
the Amazon.
