  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 10 Feb (DPA) -- Several gunmen 
on a highway leading to the Colombian city of Ibague murdered 
Colombian Ambassador to Honduras Lucelly Garcia today. 
  Garcia, 60, had presented her credentials to the Honduran 
Government 14 days ago and had returned to Colombia to present a 
book entitled "Petition for Protection, Opening to Democracy." 
  The police reported the diplomat was traveling from the 
coffee-producing area of Calarca, her hometown, to Santa Fe de 
Bogota in the company of her sister Ruby Garcia, the Colombian 
consul to Mexico, who was injured. 
  Ruby Garcia said a four-wheel drive vehicle blocked the path 
of the car in which they were traveling, and two men came out of 
it, and one of them shot the ambassador, who was taken to a 
clinic in Ibague where she died. 
  The circumstances surrounding the attack on Ambassador 
Garcia 
are unclear. The police said robbery could have been the 
motive, but murder was not ruled out. 
  Garcia, a liberal, was governor of the western Department of 
Quindio, where Calarca is located. She was also a member of the 
Lower Chamber of the Colombian Congress. She lost her seat over 
a scandal about alleged irregular activities favoring her 
hometown's Culture House. 
  For more than 30 years the diplomat's political life was 
characterized by her combativeness, which was reflected in 
strong speeches, vigorous decisions, and constant clashes with 
her adversaries. 
  Her body will reportedly be taken to Santa Fe de Bogota in 
the next hours for an homage at the Congress of the Republic, 
political friends of the murdered ambassador said.
