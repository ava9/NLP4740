  [Text] Olanchito, Yoro -- It was officially announced 
yesterday that seven persons, who were victims of explosions 
caused by grenades left behind by the U.S. Army in this village, 
filed a suit against the U.S. Army with the local Criminal Trial 
Court. 
  The U.S. Army has been participating in joint activities 
with 
Honduran Armed Forces on Honduran territory for a long time. 
These activities include specifically military civic action and 
the construction of roads and landing strips. 
  Raul Enrique Funez Santos was killed by a grenade explosion 
because he took a grenade home after finding it on the road. 
According to Funez Santos' relatives, the victim took the fuse 
from the grenade, which, in addition to killing him, injured 
those who were around him at the time of the explosion. 
  In the suit filed with the courts, the U.S. and the Honduran 
Armies are accused of homicide and injuries caused by explosive 
devices that were left behind in the area where they had 
conducted military operations in May 1993 in the village of 
Puntillas, in Olanchito, Yoro. 
  The plaintiffs are Maria Josefa Antunez, Lucrecia Rosales on 
behalf of the minor Maribel Melendez, Edin Martinez, and Mario 
Denis Rosales, all residents of Puntillas. Another group of 
plaintiffs includes Santos Diaz on behalf of his youngest son 
Rigoberto Villafranca Diaz, Enit Yovani Garcia Zelaya, and Juan 
Francisco Tejeda on behalf of his youngest son Juan Francisco 
Tejeda, who live in El Carril, Olanchito. 
  It was learned that the suit is basically against the 
Honduran Government because, according to the Executive Branch, 
National Congress authorities were the ones to approve 
operations of this type. 
  The explosion that killed Funez Santos injured the 
following: 
Maribel Melendez (11), Edin Marina Martinez (31), Mario Denis 
Rosales (19), Maria Josefa Antunez (31), Rigoberto Villafranca 
(17), Enit Yovani Zelaya (23), and Francisco Tejeda (11). 
Villafranca lost his left eye and part of his left foot. 
According to witnesses, Funez Santos and his brothers Denis 
Yovani and Francisco Alexis found seven grenades that were used 
by the U.S. and Honduran Armies and took them home. 
  It was reported that the suit was filed through the 
Committee 
for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras.
