  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of Mexico 
City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish reporting on domestic and 
foreign reaction to the 23 March assassination in Tijuana, Baja 
California, of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, presidential 
candidate for the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI. 
  Radio ACIR at 0544 GMT on 24 March carries a two-minute 
report on a communique issued by the Revolutionary Workers 
Party, PRT, regretting the attack on Luis Donaldo Colosio 
Murrieta and pointing out that although "this action might open 
a period of grave political uncertainty, it should not be cause 
for a repressive atmosphere of political persecution." The PRT 
urges a thorough investigation of the attack, and calls on the 
citizens to remain calm. 
  At 0549 GMT on 24 March, Radio ACIR reports that Canadian 
Prime Minister Jean Chretien said: "In spite of the attack 
against Colosio, Mexico should not stop the changes and reforms 
it has carried out." "This is the price of democracy, the price 
of seeking the people and being close to the people. I cannot 
find words to express the shock of this terrible tragedy," 
Chretien concluded. 
  Radio ACIR carries a one-minute report at 0603 GMT on 24 
March on a communique issued on 23 March by the Mexican Senate 
expressing condolences to the Colosio family over the 
"regrettable" death of Luis Donaldo Colosio. In the communique, 
the Senate adds that "the nation has lost a politician committed 
to freedom, democracy, social justice, and the sovereignty of 
Mexico." 
  At 0628 GMT on 24 March, Radio ACIR reports that the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front from El Salvador has 
sent condolences, expressing "the strongest rejection of this 
criminal action that will not tarnish the democratic ideals of 
the Mexican people." 
  Mexico City ACIR Network in Spanish at 1457 GMT on 24 March 
carries a live report by Luis Carlos Santoyo from San Cristobal 
de las Casas, Chiapas State. Santoyo reports that the death of 
Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta has been "shocking" to the people 
in San Cristobal de las Casas. The report adds that peace 
commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis first made a statement then 
withdrew to the hotel where he remained throughout the night 
while "security measures were increased." Radio ACIR adds that 
Camacho Solis "looks sad and, to a certain extent, insecure. He 
is very worried about what is happening. He said he did not 
want to make any statements because these are not moments to 
talk about other matters. He said that he feels very sad and 
will go to Mexico City to express his sympathy to Colosio's 
family and the country's political family," the report concluded. 
  Radio ACIR adds at 1551 GMT on 24 March that Honduran 
President Carlos Roberto Reina "deplored" the murder of Colosio, 
and that Reina had telephoned the Mexican ambassador in 
Tegucigalpa to express "the solidarity of the people and 
government of Honduras."
