into uncharted waters - Simon Holberton examines the flotation of a mainland
Chinese company on the Hong Kong market

THE first time that Jiang Bo encountered China Merchants was in 1949 in
Shanghai. The People's Liberation Army liberated the city from Nationalist
control and he was one of the officials the new communist government sent
into the company's then head office to seize its assets.
Today, 67-year-old Mr Jiang, a Communist party member since 1944, is China
Merchant's managing director and the man who has presided over its expansion
from a shipping company to one which owns hotels, three insurance companies,
two banks and hundreds of small industrial companies.
He is also the man who this week scored a first in the Hong Kong capital
market by floating 25 per cent of the equity of a pure Chinese mainland
company, Hai Hong Holdings, a producer of marine and industrial paints.
The offering was a success. Hai Hong sought less than HKDollars 100m
(USDollars 12.9m), but on Monday Hong Kong investors - hungry for any stock
that can be described as a 'China play' - stumped up HKDollars 31.2bn to
make the issue 373 times oversubscribed.
Mr Jiang says it is possible that in the future Hai Hong may become China
Merchant's main listed company on the Hong Kong exchange. It will always
wish to retain at least 51 per cent of the company, he said, but did not
rule out selling its interests in other assets the company now holds
privately.
The strength of investor interest reinforced the growing importance of Hong
Kong as a source of capital for the mainland. Equally importantly, it
underlined a significant change of approach to the colony by the mainland
establishment.
China Merchants, along with the three other 'Heavenly Sisters' - China
Resources, Bank of China, and China Travel Service - has been one of the
more conservatively-managed mainland companies in Hong Kong, preferring to
go about its business with the minimum of fuss.
But in keeping with Beijing's 'open door' policy of economic reform and the
impending transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty to China in 1997, the
mainland's economic presence in the colony is daily becoming more visible.
China Merchants is the mainland's oldest company in Hong Kong. It was
founded in 1872 by Li Hung-Chang, a late Qing dynasty reformer, and has
always had close ties with the Chinese state.
Since 1949, when the communists assumed power in China, it has been under
the 'direction' of the Ministry of Communications. The minister of
communications is the chairman of the company's board, but China Merchants'
operational headquarters is in Hong Kong and, since 1978 when Deng
Xiaoping's reforms were inaugurated, its managing director has been given
considerable latitude to develop the business.
Today, China Merchants employs 40,000 people in 22 wholly-owned subsidiaries
and 40 Hong Kong joint ventures, and operates 368 mainly industrial
companies, the bulk of which are located in a region of the Shenzhen special
economic zone called Shekou. This is a port situated on the Pearl River
Delta, which the company owns and operates on behalf of the Ministry of
Communications.
According to Mr Jiang, the company has assets with a book value of HKDollars
12bn, HKDollars 6bn of debt, and made profits last year of HKDollars 200m.
Profits in 1991 were hit by the poor performance of its UK marine insurer,
Scottish Lion Insurance.
The company also owns a shipping line, called Ming Wah, which made profits
of HKDollars 300m in 1991. Ming Wah owns and operates a fleet of ships of
3.5m dead-weight tonnes - the second largest in Hong Kong.
The core of its business remains shipping. Last year its ships carried 11
per cent of Hong Kong's trade that went by sea; they also handled 50 per
cent of all marine trade by Chinese-invested companies in Hong Kong.
China Merchants also operates ship repair and maintenance facilities, and
owns docks and container operations in Hong Kong, Shekou and Shenzhen.
Earlier this year it paid HKDollars 175m for a 15 per cent share of Modern
Terminals Limited - one of the main owner-operators of Hong Kong's container
port.
'Because we are under the Ministry of Communications our main business is
shipping,' says Mr Jiang. 'But if we have the opportunity we are also
prepared to diversify and develop other activities.'
Since he became managing director in 1985, the company has bought into
banking and insurance and increased the vertical integration of its shipping
business by acquiring a ship repair business and warehouses.
The company has also done its bit for the economic development of other
parts of the mainland by setting up businesses in the Pudong area of
Shanghai and in Weihai, Shandong province, and recently acquiring an 18 sq
km area of land in Zhangzhou, Fujian province, to develop as a free trade
zone.
These ventures are part of the 'developmental' role the big mainland
companies in Hong Kong are meant to fulfil for China. In Shekou, where the
company has funded the ports development and taken slices of 340-odd
industrial companies which have set up business there, it is also building a
35km railway to connect the port with the industrialised part of Shenzhen to
the west.
The company's move into banking and insurance fulfils both the developmental
and profit-seeking brief it has been given. Scottish Lion may be a
loss-maker today, but China Merchants has plans to set up a branch in
Shanghai and, as a mainland-owned company, it should be well placed to take
advantage of the liberalisation being planned for China's the insurance
market.
Similarly in banking. It owns a controlling interest in Hong Kong's Union
Bank, and has a joint venture bank on the mainland, China Merchants Bank.
Both are small, but the seeds of future growth have been sown.
As Mr Jiang said: 'I joined the revolution in 1944 to make China rich and
strong.'
