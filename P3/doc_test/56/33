  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 3 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Honduran-flagged 
ships were found carrying fuel to Haiti, thus violating the 
embargo the UN Security Council imposed on that country, 
authorities admitted today. Carlos Sosa Coello, chairman of the 
Chairman of the National Drug Interdiction Committee, told 
NOTIMEX "there are Honduran ships that illegally smuggle Chinese 
citizens into the United States and others transport fuel to 
Haiti." 
  Sosa Coello charged that ships registered in Honduras were 
also detected in international waters carrying drugs. The 
Honduran National Congress is getting ready to discuss the 
existing Merchant Marine Law, through which a government leases 
its flag to foreign businessman who request it. The military 
controls the merchant marine, and the civilian government 
receives no income from the registering of foreign ships. 
  The military does not provide or report on the amounts of 
money they earn for leasing the national flag, but sources at 
the Congress said the business could yield close to $40 million 
a year. "We have an open registry of merchant vessels in 
Honduras, from which every one profits except the treasury," 
Sosa Coello indicated. 
  Nelman Sabillon, secretary of the Maritime Commission of the 
Foreign Ministry, said that since 1993 ships flying the Honduran 
flag have violated the then "partial" agreement to put a 
blockade on Haiti. 
  The U.S. Coast Guard Service informed the Honduran 
Government 
that in 1993 it intercepted Honduran-flag vessels carrying fuel 
to Haiti. Bilateral agreements allow the United States to 
intercept and come aboard Honduran vessels and aircraft in 
international waters within the efforts the two countries are 
making to fight drug trafficking. Sabillon also disclosed that 
the previous month Japanese authorities filed a complaint 
against the Honduran-flag vessel Montana for carrying 60 Chinese 
nationals who were trying to enter the United States. Honduras 
has to deal with complaints from the United States, Japan, 
Canada, and France that Honduran-flag vessels are fishing 
illegally in their territorial waters to the detriment of their 
fishing resources, the Foreign Ministry official indicated.
