<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Farrell Lines Incorporated (Farrell), by application dated July 15, 1994, requests a waiver of the provisions of
section 804(a) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, so as to permit Farrell to ad hoc charter, operate and/or
act as Agent or Broker for any foreign-flag vessel between the United States Gulf and east coast ports and the Black
Sea ports. The vessel type would be general-cargo ships not exceeding 12000 DWT and having refrigerated and containerized
cargo capacity. The waiver is requested for the duration of Farrell's Operating-Differential Subsidy Agreement,
Contract MA/MSB&hyph;482, which expires on December 31, 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Farrell operates a regular U.S.-flag liner service between the U.S. east coast and Mediterranean (Trade Route 10/13)
with extension to the Black Sea ports using foreign-flag feeder vessels as permitted by law. Farrell states that it
is not seeking to service any other mid point areas such as the Mediterranean under the instant request and would limit
such sailings to no more than twelve voyages per year.
