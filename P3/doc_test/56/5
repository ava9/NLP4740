SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FLORES SEEKS MERCHANT SHIP BERTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores has asked the Port of Los 
Angeles to reconsider docking the merchant ship Lane Victory at Berth 87, which 
would place the vessel near popular tourist attractions along the San Pedro 
waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to have the port tell its engineers to look at this site and pretend 
that a very prosperous shipping company" has a ship this size, which it wants 
to dock at Berth 87, and see if they can make it work, Flores told port 
officials at a City Council committee meeting Tuesday. "Try and be a little 
creative." 
</P>
<P>
Port spokeswoman Julia Nagano responded in an interview after the meeting: "We 
will evaluate it. And I am sure we will continue to look at other sites as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
A group of merchant marine veterans is trying to convert the 455-foot-long 
vessel into a museum to honor their fallen comrades. They want to dock the ship 
at Berth 87, just north of the Los Angeles Maritime Museum and a statue that 
honors merchant seamen. But port officials say that berth, along the main 
shipping channel, is needed as a cargo terminal.
