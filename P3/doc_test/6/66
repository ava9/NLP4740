FERROMET Group, the USM-quoted metals trader, plummeted from profits of
Pounds 624,000 to pre-tax losses of Pounds 12.9m in the year to December 31.
Its shares were unchanged at  3/4 p.
It said its accounts would be qualified by the auditors because, as
previously reported, Ferromet Resources, had been placed into Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings by some of its bankers. It is the group's principal
operating subsidiary in the US and 'a large part of the group in terms of
assets and earnings', according to Mr Roger Wain, group chairman.
Mr Wain said a full provision had been made in the accounts against the
group's investment in the US subsidiary, though he declined to specify its
size. He reiterated the comments he made in March that the board was in
discussions with prospective new investors.
Turnover in 1991 expanded to Pounds 73.6m (Pounds 48.3m), boosted by the
acquisition of Cronite Alloys from the receiver in June 1991 and of Missouri
Precision Castings (now under Chapter 11) in July. Operating losses amounted
to Pounds 8.48m (profits Pounds 2.47m) after administrative expenses of
Pounds 7.12m (Pounds 2.69m). Net interest payable grew by almost Pounds 1m
to Pounds 2.72m and there were exceptional charges of Pounds 1.69m (Pounds
44,000).
Retained losses came to Pounds 12.8m (profits Pounds 256,000). Losses per
share were 6.25p (earnings 0.17p) and there is no dividend for the second
year running.
The board has shrunk to three members - Mr Wain, Mr Hillel, finance
director, and Mr Larry Whyte, who in 1990 was paid more than a third of
group profits for that period. Three directors have resigned since early
December.
