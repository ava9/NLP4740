loss

KUNICK, the leisure company which recently sold a 50 per cent stake in its
nursing home business to County NatWest Ventures, plunged into the red last
year, amid unexpectedly high reorganisation charges and property
write-downs.
Exceptional charges of Pounds 12.9m left the fruit machine company with
pre-tax losses of Pounds 12.5m for the year to September 30 against a profit
last time of Pounds 8.6m. Sales fell by 6 per cent to Pounds 109.5m.
At the operating level, profits were hit by a Pounds 6.8m fall to Pounds
2.7m in the group's fruit machines business, once the cash cow which was to
have funded investment in the care services business. Overall operating
profits fell from Pounds 14.6m to Pounds 6.5m.
Mr Christopher Burnett, chairman, said 1992 had been the 'most difficult
(year) ever experienced in the UK amusement machine industry'. He blamed the
recession and the disruption caused by the restructuring of the brewing
industry following the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's inquiry into beer
supply.
The exceptional charges covered a range of Kunick's efforts to meet the
downturn, from a Pounds 5.4m write-down on property to Pounds 4.9m for the
closure of a cd/juke box manufacturing business. The setting up of the
nursing home joint venture resulted in costs of Pounds 2.6m.
Mr Burnett stressed the potential for Kunick following the care services
deal in October.
Debt had been cut from Pounds 47m to Pounds 10m, with gearing from 89 per
cent to 19 per cent. The reduction was achieved through the transfer to the
joint venture of Pounds 24m in bank borrowings, secured against the care
services assets, and the Pounds 12.5m paid by CNWV for the 50 per cent
stake. The chairman said the two investors intended to float the joint
venture, Goldsborough Holdings, within one to two years.
Mr Burnett said the visitor attractions business in France would be closed
down or sold. In March, Kunick sold its London and York Dungeon attractions
for a profit of Pounds 4m. This was offset, however, by a Pounds 3.4m
extraordinary write-down on the French attractions.
Losses per share were 7.61p (0.38p earnings).
COMMENT
Kunick has managed to survive thus far, leaving many to speculate that the
real danger has passed. Certainly the recent rise in the preference shares
add weight to that view. The question now, however, is whether one wants to
invest in a fruit machine business - even one as lightly geared as Kunick.
The upside depends on economic recovery. Although the potential for such an
operationally geared company could be good, it will never be quite as
exciting following the brewing shake-up. Kunick has had to give up its
quality earnings and growth to satisfy the bankers. Potential investors
might want some indication of a long-term business strategy before stepping
in. Forecasts range from break even to Pounds 2m pre-tax. Either way, the
shares are highly speculative.
