FT  14 NOV 92 / UK Company News: SE lifts suspension on GPG

GPG, Sir Ron Brierley's UK investment vehicle, is due to return to the stock
market on Monday after agreeing with the Stock Exchange that a suspension
lasting nearly two years should be lifted.
The Exchange suspended GPG in 1990 because it was regarded as a 'shell'
company without any real underlying businesses. GPG has since been
restructured. Although the company is still only a holding company, the
Exchange has withdrawn its reservations.
GPG's main asset is a 54.6 per cent stake in Tyndall Australia, a life
insurance and fund management company. GPG also owns 86.3 per cent of MEM, a
small Australian resources company, Eagle, a US investment manager, and
various other listed and unlisted investments.
GPG had proforma net assets per share of 16.2p at the end of October. Its
shares, which also trade in New Zealand, closed at 15.1p yesterday.
Mr Blake Nixon, director, said the company was looking to make small
investments in UK 'special situations' to balance its portfolio better. The
company generates no turnover in the UK at present. It does not plan to pay
dividends, partly because of advance corporation tax liability and partly
because it hopes for capital growth.
GPG was last month criticised by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, which
oversees corporate reporting, for adopting newly drafted accounting
standards too hastily in order to flatter profits. The standards have now
come into force, so the results were allowed to stand.
The company is changing its year end and in the nine months to June 30
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.15m. This compared with Pounds 10.9m in
the year to September 30, since adjusted to a loss of Pounds 27.4m to
reflect goodwill previously written off.
Tyndall Australia reported a sharp decline in pre-tax profits in the six
months to June 30 of ADollars 3.59m (Pounds 1.63). This compared with
profits of Dollars 12.9m in the year to December 31. Mr Nixon said the
company witnessed a weak first quarter, but the second half is expected to
be better. The company has retained losses of Dollars 19.3m.
GPG will hold an extraordinary meeting next year and proposes to change its
name back to Guinness Peat Group, as it was known until 1987.
