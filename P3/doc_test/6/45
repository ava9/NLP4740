FT  23 JUN 93 / Losses at LET hit Swedish parent

LONDON &amp; Edinburgh Trust, the UK property company bought by SPP, the Swedish
insurer three years ago, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 448.6m in 1992.
The loss, one of the largest ever announced by a UK property company,
followed a Pounds 138.1m pre-tax loss for 1991.
The result, which the company blamed on 'adverse economic conditions', was
mainly due to write-downs on development and investment property.
SPP has supported LET with shareholder loans and new capital. Last December,
LET's parent company swapped Pounds 421.1m of debt for equity.
LET's parent company also bought Pounds 47.5m of new shares to allow it to
redeem its preference shares.
The result is an embarrassment for SPP, which has been criticised in Sweden
for its Pounds 491m acquisition of LET in 1990 when the UK property market
had peaked. Heavy losses suffered by Swedish investors and lenders in
overseas property markets have added to the crisis in the Swedish financial
system caused by the collapse of Swedish property values.
The group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 354.5m in the UK; Pounds 20.9m
in continental Europe; and Pounds 73.2m in the US. It had a Pounds 55.3m
write-down on development property, a Pounds 180.9m write-down of investment
property and a Pounds 188.5m share of its associates' losses. The group's
net assets fell from Pounds 694.8m to Pounds 577m.
The losses partially reflect the group's exposure to the development market.
Its projects include proposals to redevelop Birmingham's Bull Ring and a
site in Spitalfields in the City of London.
However the latest report makes it doubtful that LET will develop these
projects. Property development had been scaled down to a point where it was
now incidental, it said.
LET paid a total of Pounds 500,000 in compensation for loss of office. In
February 1992, Mr John Beckwith resigned as chairman. Mr Peter Beckwith, his
brother who took over as chairman, resigned last November. The two brothers,
who founded LET, owned stakes valued at about Pounds 40m each when LET was
taken over.
SPP is part of Trygg-Hansa SPP, which returned to profit in the first four
months of this year, after making heavy losses last year.
