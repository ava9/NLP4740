Pounds 4.5m in the red

REFLECTING another dry summer and the recession Ransomes, the grass cutting
machinery maker, reported a turnround of Pounds 13.6m to pre-tax losses of
Pounds 4.5m for the year 1991.
The company, which omitted its interim dividend, is also passing the final
payment - shareholders received a total of 6.15p for 1990. The directors
warned that dividends on the convertible preference shares, due next month,
may also be passed.
Mr Bob Dodsworth, chief executive, said the company's bankers, Barclays and
National Westminster remain 'fully supportive'.
Borrowings increased by Pounds 5.5m to Pounds 69.9m by the year end, a
legacy from the 1989 takeover of Cushman in the US and other purchases.
Borrowing facilities have been revised and are secure until the end of
November. The company has given its UK and US assets as security.
Turnover fell to Pounds 146.7m (Pounds 165.2m) and operating profits to
Pounds 6.1m (Pounds 17.9m). The fall in turnover reflected lower sales of
commercial grass machinery and industrial vehicles. As well as climatic
factors, sales to golf courses and local authorities in the UK were also
down.
Consumer machinery sales, mainly Mountfield mowers and Westwood garden
tractors, were flat at Pounds 36m.
Interest charges increased to Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 8.8m) and there were
exceptional costs of Pounds 1.5m from staff cuts in the UK and US. Losses
per share totalled 17.3p (earnings 1.6p).
Ransomes' investment property division contributed operating profits of
Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 600,000) from disposals.
The property portfolio has been revalued at Pounds 34m, down 11 per cent
since 1988. Ransomes said it plans to accelerate disposals.
COMMENT
Ransomes may be regretting its 1989 assessment that the grass was greener in
the US. Borrowings taken on to finance the Cushman takeover look dangerously
high now recession and the weather have conspired to send operating profits
back to mid 1980s levels. Gearing stood at 170 per cent at year end but will
rise above 200 per cent during the company's peak borrowing period. Apart
from a quick rain dance, there is little Ransomes can do at this stage. The
plan to speed up land sales is all very well, but the property market
already has its fair share of forced sellers. Forecast profits for 1992 of
Pounds 3.5m will still translate into a pre-tax loss if the preference
dividends are paid. No dividend on the ordinaries looks likely this year and
shareholders cannot even console themselves with takeover speculation - any
takeover bid would risk reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
because of Ransomes' leading position in the UK lawn mower market. Longer
term, Ransomes has good brands, it has maintained market share and, finances
aside, is prepared for any upturn. The question, therefore, is which comes
first, upturn, rain or disillusioned bankers.
