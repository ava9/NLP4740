wake of plunge into losses

BUCKINGHAM International, the hotels, tours and nursing homes operator,
yesterday announced plans to raise about Pounds 30m in the wake of a plunge
into pre-tax losses for the year to November 3 and static losses for the six
months to May 3.
Mr Nick Jivraj, chief executive, said Buckingham, having breached its
banking covenants, had the option of either 'a firesale of the company's
non-income producing assets' or a refinancing.
The company is to issue for cash Pounds 33m nominal of secured redeemable
loan stock 1995 at par and 23.1m convertible deferred shares at 0.14p.
Mr Jivraj said that the Pounds 30m net proceeds would: pay off Pounds 19m of
bank loans; provide working capital; give the company a three-year breathing
space in which to sell the non-income producing assets; and allow the
completion of the apartment complex in Portugal.
The Gulf war had caught Buckingham with a third of its room stock under
development and Mr Jivraj said that the conflict had an immediate and
detrimental effect on its hotel operations. Cash dried up and covenants were
heavily breached - particularly those relating to interest cover.
Jivraj family interests and investment trusts under the management of Robert
Fleming will take up all their entitlements in the placing. The family
interests will be putting up about Pounds 18m of the Pounds 33m raised and
loan stockholders will end up with 73 per cent of the enlarged equity.
In the year to November 3, turnover rose 33 per cent to Pounds 49.1m (Pounds
37m), although operating profits fell 12 per cent to Pounds 6.17m (Pounds
7.04m). However a jump in interest to Pounds 4.92m (Pounds 1.14m) and
exceptional charges of Pounds 9.47m - write-down of assets of Pounds 8m and
loan renegotiation fees of Pounds 1.5m - left pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.21m
(profits Pounds 5.9m). Losses per share worked through at 7.01p (earnings
5.4p) and the final dividend is omitted, as the interim had been. The
previous year's total was 2.1p.
Borrowings had risen by Pounds 24.2m over the year to Pounds 81.2m, giving
gearing of 82 per cent.
In the six months to May 3 turnover advanced 40 per cent to Pounds 21.9m
(Pounds 15.6m) reflecting first-time trading from the Holiday Inn Crowne
Plaza in Lisbon and two hotels in San Antonio, Texas. Operating profits
almost trebled to Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 440,000). However, pre-tax losses
crept up to Pounds 2.21m (Pounds 2.15m) after interest charges more than
doubled at Pounds 4.01m (Pounds 1.73m).
Losses per share were 1.84p (1.78p) and Mr Jivraj said the company would not
resume dividend payments until after a substantial disposal.
