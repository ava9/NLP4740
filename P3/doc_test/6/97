FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Standard Chartered at Pounds 401m - Strong
earnings from Hong Kong and Asia Pacific boost profits

Standard Chartered, the UK-based international banking group, yesterday
raised its 1993 dividend by 20 per cent to 24p after strong earnings from
Hong Kong and the Asia Pacific pushed its pre-tax profits to a record Pounds
401m.
The pre-tax figure was twice the Pounds 189m returned in 1992, that figure
having been restated for exchange rate adjustments and changes in
accounting.
The increased dividend was four times covered by earnings per share of 96.2p
(24.7p restated).
The bank announced a proposed 4-for-1 split of its Pounds 1 ordinary shares,
which have been volatile because of limited liquidity. The shares yesterday
closed 37p down at 1143p after initially rising sharply on the results.
Hong Kong operations contributed Pounds 234m of the pre-tax profit, with a
further Pounds 139m coming from other Asia Pacific countries. There was a
loss of Pounds 16m on operations in the UK after making a Pounds 159m
provision against UK bad debts.
Mr Patrick Gillam, chairman, said that Standard Chartered would concentrate
on building businesses in east and south east Asia. It intended to seek
listings on the Singapore and Hong Kong stock exchanges to reinforce its
commitment.
The charge for bad and doubtful debts was Pounds 233m, sharply down on the
Pounds 364m in 1992, although the 1992 figure included a Pounds 269m
provision against Standard Chartered's involvement in the securities
industry scandal in India.
Mr Gillam said the bank had already recovered Pounds 34m from its exposure
to the Bombay scandal, helped by employing its own fraud recovery team. It
was pursuing further claims and expected to get more money back.
The charge included nearly Pounds 20m against a single corporate exposure in
Japan, but half of the total came from topping up old UK problem loans. Mr
Gillam said provisions were intended to establish 'a solid base' for future
profits.
The bank reduced its exposure to commercial property in Hong Kong by Pounds
250m during the year. However, Mr Peter Wood, director of risk management,
said he expected provisions against bad debts in Hong Kong to rise
eventually.
Ratios of capital to risk-weighted assets rose strongly after it retained
earnings of Pounds 171m (Pounds 11m) and issued Pounds 100m of preference
shares. The tier one ratio of core capital to risk assets rose to 6.6 per
cent (4.9 per cent).
The cost to income ratio fell slightly to 63.3 per cent, against 64.4 per
cent despite a rise in operating expenses to Pounds 1.06bn (Pounds 791m).
Mr Malcolm Williamson, chief executive, said the bank could save 'tens of
millions' by centralising some processing in its regional 'hubs'.
