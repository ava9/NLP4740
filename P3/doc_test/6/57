WATES CITY of London Properties, the property investment and development
group, yesterday reported a Pounds 74.9m pre-tax loss for 1992 and passed
its final dividend.
Net assets per share more than halved to 74.4p (151p).
The deficit, which compared with previous profits of Pounds 8.17m, largely
reflected the transfer of a net Pounds 71.9m deficit on the revaluation
reserve to the profit and loss account, coupled with a Pounds 8.77m loss
taken on the sale of two investment properties.
Net rental income increased by 5 per cent to Pounds 15.8m (Pounds 15m) but
interest payments climbed to Pounds 6.77m (Pounds 3.92m) and largely
accounted for the decline in profit before exceptional items to Pounds 5.77m
(Pounds 8.17m).
Losses per share of 60.91p compared with earnings of 4.33p. With the final
dividend omitted shareholders are left with a 0.77p for the year - for 1991
they received an interim of 0.77p and a final of 2.96p.
Reflecting the continuing decline in property values net assets fell from
Pounds 181.2m to Pounds 89.3m at the end of 1992. It was the third
consecutive year that net assets had fallen. The worst affected part of the
portfolio was development properties which again fell by 44 per cent, while
the overall value of investment properties dropped by 21 per cent.
At the year-end net borrowings stood at Pounds 90.9m (Pounds 91.2m),
representing gearing of 102 per cent. In December the group rearranged its
principal borrowings with a syndicate of four banks. The new five year
Pounds 85m facility, which is secured on some of the group's properties,
replaced a Pounds 105m facility which was due to be repaid in June next
year.
Commenting on the results Mr Dundas Hamilton, chairman, said: '1992 has been
without doubt the most difficult year in the history of the company.
'The failure of others in the property sector has led the banks to apply
increasingly stringent lending criteria. We are fortunate that the company
entered the recession with a relatively modest level of gearing.'
He added: 'There is some evidence that the worst of the recession is over.'
