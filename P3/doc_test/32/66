Kids who couldn't get enough of Disney's "The Little Mermaid" will have plenty 
of new mermaid adventure stories and music to look forward to if the Disney 
Channel's daily half-hour "The Little Mermaid's Island" show debuts before 
year's end, which looks likely. It's been in the planning stages, says producer 
John Purdy, since before the animated feature came out.

For the TV version, Ariel the Mermaid will be a real-live lady -- actress 
Marietta Deprima -- whose island home and undersea grotto will be inhabited by 
Jim Henson puppet versions of characters from the film.

Sam Wright (Sebastian the Crab) and Buddy Hackett (Scuttle the Seagull) are 
among those already set to reprise their vocal roles.

Purdy says that four musical numbers per episode are planned, with 10 
songwriters already at work. Stacy Jenel Smith
