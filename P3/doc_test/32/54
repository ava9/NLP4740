FT  21 DEC 93 / Technology: Teddy gets interactive - Manufacturers are
seeking to produce cost-effective high-tech toys

High-tech toys may seem a contradiction to many people, but toy
manufacturers keep trying. Barbies with holographed ball gowns, teddy bears
which converse with television characters and interactive Sesame Street CDs
are a few of the futuristic playthings which have made their way onto store
shelves this Christmas.
Although novelties like these can offer a big payback at the cash register,
they can also be risky for manufacturers. High technology often implies high
cost, and toys are a low-cost industry. 'Most parents won't spend that much
on a toy,' says John Handy, vice-president in charge of design for Mattel
toys, a leading US toy maker. 'The vast majority of toys retail in the
Dollars 5 to Dollars 30 range, so we have to spin our magic with relatively
low-cost technology.'
Many manufacturers stumble on this point. The toy company, Worlds of Wonder,
for instance, thought it had hit the jackpot when it developed the 'Julie
Doll'. 'Julie' used advanced voice recognition techniques. For instance, if
a child expressed fatigue, the doll would recognise the word 'tired' and
respond 'I'm tired too; let's go to bed.' Although an enchanting plaything,
the project was scuppered by exorbitant production costs.
To make matters worse, children can be exacting customers. 'Children lose
interest easily, so the toys have to be extremely entertaining,' Handy
continues. 'They also have to be sturdy, able to withstand a lot of play,
and they have to meet very strict safety standards. Materials must be
non-toxic, and incapable of inflicting damage to small children.'
To meet the considerable challenge of designing high-tech toys,
manufacturers have developed various strategies. Yes] Entertainment
Corporation, a US toy maker, follows the maxim: 'Keep it simple'.
Yes] is putting out a product called TV Teddy, which interacts with
personalities on the television screen. Consumers receive video tapes when
they purchase the stuffed bear. The star of one of the tapes is Anthony, a
kindly gentleman with an affection for attics.
TV Teddy works through a radio signal sent out from the TV screen. 'We've
encoded extra audio information into a standard TV signal,' explains
Lawrence McKracken, director of engineering for the group. 'Most video
information contains a visual track and an audio track. Our third audio
track is picked up by the teddy bear.'
The technology is deceptively simple, yet the company says it can be adapted
to a number of different products. 'The most important thing is that there's
no limit to what Teddy can say,' says chairman and chief executive office
Donald Kingsboro. 'Is this the most sophisticated interactive technology
around? No. But the point is that it's available now, and it's cheap.' TV
Teddy retails for about Dollars 69 (Pounds 46).
Over the next few years, the company plans to launch what it calls a 'new
generation of multi-media toys'. TV Teddy will soon be able to interact with
regularly scheduled network programmes. Yes] has signed an agreement to have
the stuffed bear interact with an ABC Children's special sometime in early
1994, and says similar deals are in the pipeline.
'The next step is to have the child interact with the programme directly,'
says Kingsboro. 'We may provide a hand-held piece of plastic which kids
could enter answers on during children's game shows. Or promote a 'draw on
the screen' concept. Maybe not directly on the screen, because not many
parents want their children that close to the set. But on a hand-held video
picture which would also appear on the television screen.'
'Interactive' is a buzz word for toys this season, and Yes] is not the only
company capitalising on the new craze. Philips, the Dutch electronics group,
hopes for Christmas success with interactive CD/videos for children.
Philips has a very different formula than Yes] for keeping costs down. 'Our
philosophy is that if the parents buy the hardware for themselves, they'll
invest in extra software for the kids,' said David McElhatten, president of
the games division for Philips.
In October , Philips began putting out a sophisticated product which
connects CDs' audio capabilities with video technology. Dubbed 'CD-I' for
'compact disc-interactive', Philips's new CDs hold video games, and
feature-length films.
The technology is designed to give viewers more control over viewing and
listening habits. For instance, a work-out tape can be programmed
individually to play the music the consumer wants and the specific exercises
the consumer wants. Music CDs can be modified to exclude songs the listener
does not like, and Philips claims its videos and films are far more durable
than anything available in tape form.
Despite the technology's obvious appeal to adults, Philips says nearly 30
per cent of its software sales in CD-I are in children's entertainment. The
group is even selling large volumes of its hardware in toy stores like FAO
Schwarz. Children are offered a wide variety of video games to choose from,
with popular characters like the Sesame Street muppets and the Berenstain
Bears.
US toy manufacturers Hasbro and Mattel are treading yet another path to
cost-effective high-tech toys. Mattel has applied its colour-changing
technology to as many toys as possible in an attempt to lower development
costs. The manufacturer incorporates a temperature-sensitive paint into
everything from dolls to paints.
Li'l Miss Candi Stripes, for instance, sports a white bathing suit that
turns pink in cold water. Her blonde hair and lips also turn pink and orange
in the cold. Mattel has just expanded its colour-changing repertoire with a
new product, Solar Gak, a dough-like substance, which changes colour when
exposed to ultraviolet light (ie the sun).
Keeping an eye on the shrinking cost of various technologies is also
important, say toy manufacturers. Computer chips, for instance, were once
formidably expensive, but have now become so cheap that they can be widely
used in children's products.
Hasbro has capitalised on low-cost, high-memory chips to produce Talking
Barney, a stuffed green dinosaur which says 500 different phrases at random.
'Before, six or seven sayings were considered a lot,' says Sharon Hartley,
vice president of marketing for Playskool, the Hasbro division that makes
Talking Barney. 'But additional memory has become so cheap now that we've
been able to use it in a number of toys.'
With the cost of technology diminishing rapidly, toy manufacturers say their
products will soon use technologies once thought too expensive even for the
adult consumer market. 'We have to keep an eye on the technology market,
because it can help us provide that element of magic which is so important
in play,' says Hartley. 'And as these technologies get cheaper, they should
become increasingly easy for the toy market to tap.'
