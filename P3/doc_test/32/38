Talking clocks, singing socks, sight gags and TV send-ups -- "The Timmy the 
Tooth Variety Show," a new live puppet theater production for children at 
Burbank's Gypsy Playhouse, holds offbeat appeal for adults as well. 
</P>
<P>
Timmy the Tooth, a congenial bicuspid and show biz enthusiast, along with his 
sidekick Ed McBrush-Brush, hosts an assortment of talents, from Dean Thesaurus 
("Don't quit your day job, Dean") to the rock 'n' rollin' New Socks on the 
Block, with their hit song, "Burnin' Itch." 
</P>
<P>
Julia Giraffe conducts a "Name That Fruit" segment where the hapless 
contestants end up in the blender, a commercial advertises "Ninja Babies" and 
Dr. Gum interrupts the proceedings to warn Timmy about a blue, tentacled Cavity 
Creep on the loose. 
</P>
<P>
With its obvious mix of Pee Wee Herman and "The Muppet Show" influences, it's 
no surprise to learn that writer-puppeteer Kevin Carlson plays Clockey, Floorey 
and Conky on "Pee Wee's Playhouse," or that co-writer and puppeteer James 
Murray has worked with the late Jim Henson and Disney Productions and on such 
shows as "D.C. Follies." 
</P>
<P>
Director Susan Carlson and producer-performer Dina Murray, with extensive 
backgrounds in children's theater, have also been involved with Muppet and 
Disney productions. 
</P>
<P>
The puppet designs lack originality and there are some timing lags, but the 
music and dialogue have professional polish, and Michael Fairman's lighting -- 
strobe and colors -- is a young crowd pleaser. It's pleasant fun from the 
Kidding Around Productions troupe, with one caveat: The small theater is stuffy 
on a warm day, despite overhead fans. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3321 W. Olive Ave. in Burbank through Oct. 27, Saturdays at noon and 2 p.m. 
$4; (818) 954-9858.
