NBC's "Santa Barbara" was named best drama series for the third year in a row 
and two of its Latino stars also walked off with awards Thursday at the 17th 
annual Daytime Emmy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
"Sally Jessy Raphael" won the Emmy as best talk show and PBS' "Reading Rainbow" 
was honored as best children's series in ceremonies held at the Marriott 
Marquis Hotel in New York City and broadcast nationally on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Rivers, whose late-night talk show flopped on Fox Broadcasting three years 
ago, was chosen daytime's best talk show host, even though her syndicated 
series, "The Joan Rivers Show," was not nominated. 
</P>
<P>
"I always had a fantasy about winning one of these," Rivers said in her 
acceptance speech. 
</P>
<P>
While handing out thank yous to her staff, she began to cry. "Two years ago, I 
couldn't get a job and my income dropped," she said. Then, alluding to her late 
husband, Edgar Rosenberg, who committed suicide in August, 1987, she said, 
"This is really for him. He was with me at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
"Jeopardy!" was named best game show, and its host, Alex Trebek, shared the 
Emmy for best host with Bob Barker of "The Price Is Right." Trebek had won last 
year; Barker won in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A tie also was voted in the category of best animated program. ABC's "The New 
Adventures of Winnie the Pooh," which won last year, shared this year's award 
with another Saturday morning series on ABC, "Beetlejuice." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Emmy for best daytime soap opera, "Santa Barbara" also picked up 
awards for A Martinez as best actor, Henry Darrow as best supporting actor, 
directing and lighting direction. The NBC serial had won six Emmys last year. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Zimmer, who plays Reva Shayne Lewis on "Guiding Light," was named best 
actress in a daytime drama. Among the actresses she beat out was Susan Lucci of 
"All My Children," who has now been nominated for 11 consecutive years without 
winning. One of Lucci's co-stars, Julia Barr, won as best supporting actress. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, CBS won 12 Daytime Emmys and PBS captured 11 -- seven for "Sesame 
Street." Syndicated programs garnered 10, NBC got 9, ABC received 8 and the 
Disney Channel got 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Daytime Emmys, covering the period between March 6, 1989 and March 5, 1990, 
were presented jointly by the Los Angeles-based Academy of Television Arts 
&amp; Sciences and the New York-based National Academy of Television Arts &amp; 
Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Awards for prime-time programming will be presented Sept. 16.
