This is not the place to look for regular reviews of Pobol y Cwym, the soap
opera which has been running for years on Channel 4 in Wales and began
transmission four afternoons a week on BBC2 on Monday under the title People
Of The Valley. Nor should you look here for long supercilious articles about
Noel's House Party and Mr Blobby, or frequent 'funny' pieces scoring points
off the inanity of such daytime programmes as The Big Breakfast and Good
Morning. Newcomers to this page may think this odd, given the space devoted
by other broadsheet newspapers to such material these days. So, it being
January, perhaps it is worth recalling some of the precepts underpinning
this column.
They are not very different from those that, presumably, underpin the other
parts of this page. Most people's experience of dance comes from the local
palais and Come Dancing on television but the FT dance critic concerns
himself chiefly with the Royal Ballet, the Rambert company and so on. With
book reviews the FT concentrates on history, biography, travel, and those
novels which educated people would consider serious. Nobody seems surprised
by the absence of reviews of the romances pumped out by Mills and Boon and
Barbara Cartland although they sell many more copies than the books that we
do review. From time to time, as in last Saturday's Weekend FT, there will
be a think piece on the historical or social significance of changes in
these mass selling books. Similarly this television column is devoted once
in a while to consideration of such phenomena as game shows, Australian soap
operas and the daytime sofa shows. But they are rarely reviewed
individually.
Sustaining such an approach is increasingly difficult in a world where more
and more people maintain that all cultural phenomena are of equal
significance and that everything on television is consequently equally
worthy of notice. It is not only a matter of the tiresome quagmire of
relativism that we have been dragged into during the last couple of years
(you know, 'Was Keats really a better poet than Bob Dylan?' expecting the
answer 'Who can say?' when actually the sensible answer is 'Of course he
was, but Dylan was better at folk-rock'). The difficulty arises from an
older movement which began with George Orwell's brilliant essays on such
subjects as Boys' Papers in the 1940s and today has its most obvious
manifestation in The Modern Review which promises 'Low Culture For
Highbrows' and devotes its space to Hip Hop, The Avengers and 'One-Handed
Literature' (yes, exactly what that phrase suggests).
In the half century between Orwell and The Modern Review an entire academic
industry grew up, expanding upon the writings about mass culture by teachers
such as Richard Hoggart and Raymond Williams, and it is from that industry
that today's torrents of material on The Simpsons and pop videos come
pouring down. What is too rarely pointed out is that Hoggart, Williams, and
most of their followers were, first and foremost, socialists, secondly
sociologists, and only incidentally (and often rather badly) critics. Their
chief concern was not the quality of writing in Peg's Paper or the
originality of the plotting in Saturday morning cinema but that such
artefacts of mass culture should take their place alongside established
highbrow material. Television, which happened to develop during precisely
the same half century, was, of course, their ideal stamping ground being
more of a 'mass' medium than any other.
In this school of thought, the more popular a programme is, the more
significant it is. Thus a television critic should be devoting most space to
Coronation Street and least to weighty documentaries or the more demanding
arts programmes. If that were so there would be little point in continuing
to try to be a serious television critic. On the other hand, it would be
absurd merely to turn such assumptions upside down and review only the most
obscure and 'difficult' material. The fact is, as John Mortimer reminded us
in an impressive article in the Daily Telegraph last Saturday, the
distinction between 'serious' and 'popular' art did not exist in the time of
our greatest achievements:
'The audiences that filled the huge Elizabethan theatres, the countless
readers of Dickens, Thackeray, and George Eliot, didn't bother to ask
whether it was high art or popular art they were enjoying. Hamlet was a
ghost story and a crime story as well as the drama of a thinking man in a
brutal world. Bleak House is a murder mystery as well as being a savage
denunciation of poverty and a poetic evocation of London. These works were
immensely popular and the audience loved them . . .'
The job of the critic, surely, is to have a clear idea of what is possible
in his medium, which means, among other things, knowing what has been done
before; to identify what newcomers are trying to do, say whether that seems
worthwhile, and whether they are achieving their aims; and above all to
discriminate between good and bad. And as with Dickens, so with television:
it is quite possible to be simultaneously good and popular. Examples which
spring to mind from the recent past include Attenborough's Antarctica
series, Life In The Freezer on BBC1, and ITV's Minder which began what we
are assured is its final series last Thursday. Naturally the quality of
episodes varies, but the characterisation in Minder is always strong and the
writing usually sinewy and often funnier than in television's half-hour
comedies. Last week, in a throwaway line George Cole as wide-boy Arthur
Daley picked up the phone and announced 'Daley into Europe'. Predicting the
failure of his latest 'nice little earner' (a Minder phrase which is now in
the dictionary) he lamented 'I'll probably end up on Shepherds Bush Green
with a mongrel dog and a bottle of cider'.
To fulfil his function the television critic must, of course, watch the
first, and perhaps the first few, episodes of new series even when they may
seem wholly predictable. In the case of People Of The Valley that is
unnecessary since it is a known quantity from its years on S4C. But who
could have guessed that BBC2's new Sunday series Nomads Of The Wind, about
life in the Pacific islands, would have a script so old fashioned and
stilted as to make it sound like a parody of a 1950s Disney travelogue? Who
would have thought there was anything left to be milked out of Superman
until BBC1 began The New Adventures Of Superman early on Saturday evening?
Here is a re-telling which would be perfectly acceptable as a first-time
adventure story for an eight-year-old, but which gains enormously from the
knowledge brought to it by an adult who has grown up with the (yes, yes,
mass appeal]) comics and films. More surprising still, who on this side of
the Atlantic would have guessed that the Americans were so far into
post-feminism?
The first of four comedy pilots on BBC2 under the umbrella title Comic
Asides was a laboured skit about cabin crew on a Scottish airline which
suffered dreadfully by comparison with the screening slightly earlier on the
same channel of the first of The Lost Steptoes. All the honesty, bite and
humanity of the 1974 programme was embarrassingly absent from the slapdash
and lacklustre 1994 offering. We shall have to come back to ITV's new crime
series 99-1 since it is both stylistically interesting (some of the ice
cream colours from Miami Vice with some of the grimy locations of The
Sweeney) and tantalising in its narrative: it seems that Leslie Grantham's
character is not just a hackneyed old bent copper, but about to become some
sort of spy. We shall discover more tonight. Above all it will be necessary,
if subsequent episodes are anything like as good as the opening programme,
to return to Jonathan Meades' Friday night series on BBC2, Further Abroad.
His first programme was a cross between an essay and a catherine wheel
illustrating the use of height in buildings and the consequent horrors of
vertigo.
The idea that Pobol Y Cwm is 'just as important' as Further Abroad is
piffle, and depressing evidence that, indeed, the centre cannot hold.
