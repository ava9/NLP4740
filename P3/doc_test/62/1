A child's Christmas anywhere always seems to be part miracle. "A Child's 
Christmas in Wales," at the Grove Shakespeare Festival at the Gem, is part 
miracle. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, the show, which opened Friday, had been on the verge of 
cancellation due to a financial shortfall at the theater. It would not have 
opened if an anonymous donor had not stepped forward and provided the 
life-saving $10,000 that, together with a $6,000 grant from the Hyatt Hotels 
and additional contributions from the Garden Grove Fire Fighters and others, 
made it possible for this holiday event to go on as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
This 1982 musicalization of the Thomas work by Jeremy Brooks and Adrian 
Mitchell is in its fifth consecutive year in Garden Grove. It is not what one 
would label a great piece of work -- not enough of the Thomas language is 
allowed to come through -- but it is a show full of everything one likes to 
associate with the holidays: playfulness, warmth, wisdom, humor, caroling and 
goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
As a representation of Thomas' own childhood in the small Welsh seaside village 
of Swansea, it departs from more familiar holiday fare, though not entirely. 
The vigor of the Thomas language we do hear, and the dizzying euphoria of young 
Dylan and his playmates snowballing the neighborhood cats and taunting his coy 
girl cousins (who are better than the boys at ricocheting stones in the 
freezing sea), are a breathless, recognizable image of Christmas as seen 
through the eyes of a young boy, consumed with the exhilaration of that special 
day among special friends. 
</P>
<P>
The aunts, uncles and cousins who come for dinner are nicely delineated 
borderline cartoons we love to love. When Mother burns the Christmas bird and 
it is generously replaced by another from the Hotel Metropole, we relish the 
family moment. But when the show decides to cater to more traditional, 
harmonious visions of familial bliss, it's Dylan-Thomas-meets-Norman-Rockwell 
time, at the expense of the muscular Thomas poetry and Thomas' own keener, 
though not less loving, perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
This occurs chiefly in the Brooks-Mitchell adaptation, which also, mostly 
successfully, has fun imposing gently humorous lyrics on familiar carols. Those 
are the acceptable liberties taken by a show with nothing more complex on its 
mind than to lighten a few hearts. The events as Thomas has them, however, 
avoid saccharin, but Brooks and Mitchell (who developed this in 1982 for the 
Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival) make the experience both more universal and 
more ordinary by blunting its edges. 
</P>
<P>
As a family show, designed as much for children as their parents, it also runs 
on too long, with too many scenes that repeat themselves. Rather than tighten 
and trim, director Thomas F. Bradac has chosen to play along with this 
indulgence and allows snappy Danny Oberbeck as young Dylan (his fifth year in 
the role) to confuse cuteness with brightness. This is compensated some by the 
exemplary Gary Bell, who plays Dylan grown up (and Dylan's father) with a 
patriarchal composure that never slips into the self-important or patronizing. 
</P>
<P>
Neither, indeed, does the production. If Bradac should have been quicker with a 
blue pencil, he has mostly seen to it that what we receive is frolicsome. What 
is wanted -- and next year may provide it -- is something just a little less 
sweet. 
</P>
<P>
The sweetness should be reserved for the "Welsh Tea Time and Pastries" offered 
at the Gem after the matinees of Dec. 16, 23 and 30 (at a charge of $15). 
"Welsh Pub Nights," which happen postperformance in the Gem lounge on Fridays 
and Saturdays and include singing along with the cast, are free.
