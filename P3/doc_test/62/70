It was a photograph in Picturegoer around 1956 which first caught my
attention: the sneer on the young man's face as he challenged the camera,
and then the body contorted from the waist down, with a guitar provocatively
tilting up into the imagination. I read that an Elvis Presley was causing
consternation in the US, with his pelvic thrusts. As a teenager I had found
my hero.
Then came the movies, standard boy meets girl stuff but enlivened with
ballads which seem so innocuous now, but were so full of forbidden fruit
then. 'Don't' was my favourite; then 'Teddy Bear'. I adapted them both for
the recorder, the only musical instrument known at school, and developed the
party trick of playing them through my nose, while singing.
Hearing the actual Elvis records was difficult. BBC Radio refused to
acknowledge the existence of this new phenomenon, the youth market. It still
believed that when a boy or girl left school at 15 or 16 they turned into
carbon copies of their parents in terms of dress, manners and leisure
interests. Students were different - they liked jazz.
But if the Light Programme was an Elvis Free Zone, Radio Luxembourg knew
differently. So through the crackle and the inevitable commercials for
Horace Batchelor's football pools system I got my Elvis fix. I even took my
enthusiasm to the pitch of writing a poem, 'Shake, Elvis, Shake', which is
thankfully obliterated from memory, apart from the couplet 'to reach a
fulfilment / in definitive movement'.
The love affair with Elvis did not survive the appearance of Buddy Holly,
and then the more intellectually challenging popsters, Bob Dylan and the
rest. I do not think I was ever that keen on Elvis's records after the first
year or so. It was what he stood for that changed my life. He transformed
the world as much as any person this century. From his success came the
modern music industry, fashion industry, entertainment industry; the 'me'
generation, sexual revolution, the universal wish for self-gratification.
Elvis never progressed beyond the spiritually poor, under-educated Southern
boy, just this side of white trash. But in the hands of Dylan and the
singer-songwriters that followed, the Joni Mitchells, Leonard Cohens, Paul
Simons, Jackson Brownes and hundreds more, a new art form, the art form of
the democratic age, of the youth generation, of the global market came
forth.
Much that followed, especially the crass commercialisation, and the kicking
down of all restraints, which opened the way for drugs, was awful and
dispiriting. But Elvis released the repressed energy and idealism of youth.
He marked the divide between Them and Us - Them, the old world, old values,
the snuffers out of youth. Us, the first wave of the new world, which within
a decade would completely sweep away the past. The Light Programme became
Radio One; pop pirates became commercial radio; the Beatles got their MBEs;
London Swung; the UK gave the world its voice. Presidents, Prime Ministers
and Popes got younger.
