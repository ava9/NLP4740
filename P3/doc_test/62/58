"More than anything, this novel is a labor of love, of the admiration of a son 
for his father, which is probably not such a common thing these days. . . . But 
the story also fulfills its original premise -- that of the Dylan Thomas poem 
-- and it is uplifting to see the triumph of old Jake Hawkins, raging 
successfully against 'the dying of the light.' " Winston Groom
