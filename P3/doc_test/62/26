TO DIE unrequited must be the worst sort of death, a punishment for the
wicked or the wickedly idle.
So I was puzzled when Miron Grindea, in the middle of explaining how he had
persuaded so many famous names to contribute to his literary magazine, Adam,
broke off, shot me a sorrowful look and said:
'I wanted to tell you that I die - because I have to die soon - a very
bitter man.'
Grindea will be 83 next week. He is fighting failing health and faltering
memory to bring out an issue on Joyce Cary to mark Adam's 50th anniversary
last September.
His first Adam emerged two years after Grindea had been left stranded in
Britain by the war, a Romanian music critic on holiday from Paris with his
pianist wife, few possessions and not a word of English. It had an
introduction by HG Wells, a message from George Bernard Shaw and items by
Thomas Mann, Stefan Zweig and Cecil Day-Lewis.
I asked whether his No. 500 would be his last.
'I don't know what to say. I'm very traumatic about it. If I'm strong enough
to write . . . I am a very desperate man.' His desperation seemed to have
something to do with misprints. (The first issue contained a 'derriere
pensee' instead of an 'arriere' one). Then he told me of his afflictions, of
which arthritis and asthma were the least.
'I am haunted by my approaching death,' he said. 'I would like to end not
with . . . what you call in English . . . with a bang, but with a bit of a
confessional. I think Adam story has a few things to leave behind, not so
much about my humble person, because genuinely I am a moderate specimen of
the human race.'
Is he aggrieved because he never made money? He doesn't seem so.
'I crawled along, sometimes with a few benefactors' (they included TS Eliot,
EM Forster, JB Priestley, Rebecca West and Isaiah Berlin). He was too
disorganised to collect from his 500-odd subscribers or to put in for the
occasional Arts Council grants.
For three years in the 1960s he earned Dollars 10,000 a year as an associate
professor at the University of Rochester, New York. ('So my wife had no more
reason to divorce me]') But for most of his life he has been'dancing on the
cord, doing the trapeze'. His wife, Carola, taught at the Guildhall School
of Music for 25 years and still works, advising pianists on avoiding
muscular strain.
If you had been a real businessman would you have continued for so long?
'I don't think so. I don't know if you approve, but I don't think it's right
to run a magazine of this eccentricity if you have a sheltered life. For
instance Mr Cyril Connolly (whose Horizon lived a mere 10 years) had a
millionaire supporter and two secretaries. I never had this luxury. I don't
think the essence of running a magazine of this fantasy, of this
impertinence - because it was always a magazine of great cheek - is to
tremble for its tomorrow from day to day.'
The thought of the pampered and aristocratic Connolly seemed to fill Grindea
with strong emotions. He was breathing heavily.
But the editor of Adam has had his share of worldly recognition. He proudly
showed me his Legion d'Honneur certificate, his MBE and OBE medals. Why then
should he die unrequited?
'I die a bitter man in the sense of sad man. Although I have been married to
this very great woman and I am surrounded by musician grandchildren I would
have loved ADAM . . . my ideal, my conceit . . . I would have loved to reach
the elegance of a Cyril Connolly. I would love to have the talent of Cyril
Connolly. because he would ejaculate on a page, you know. Incidentally, I
hear his punctuation was hopeless. I devoted sacks of blood, of my life.
Every issue I jump from one precipice of research to another.'
Do you feel you haven't achieved what you wanted?
'How can I say? Flaubert would roll on the carpet to pick up the mot juste.
Well, I'm not Flaubert and even now, after 51 years here, I can't go like
you to the typewriter. I write longhand, five, six versions till I find the
mot juste.
'People like Edith Sitwell or EM Forster would pat me on the shoulder and
say 'Oh, Mr Grindea, don't be so neurotic, you coin new words for us.' But I
know the length of my nose, I know the modesty of my editorial gift.
'I think I was quite an impertinent, successful, searcher. But I had only
two elbows and two shoulders, you know. And I die bitter because I would
have loved the magazine to be something really super. One can't create
miracles.'
Did you have any other ambition?
'As a child, I would have loved to be an orchestral conductor, yes. Ja. As a
child in my village, a monkey, in front of the . . . I would conduct.'
Perhaps you are a writer manque?
'No, I don't think so. I never attempted. I never had any ambitions. No, I'm
not manque. I think my only little testament, if the Almighty gives me
another year or two, I would like to write the story of Adam.'
If it is not poverty or frustrated literary leanings, what is it that casts
Grindea down? Literary spite?
He told me he was very upset that he had been left out of the Pelican Guide
to English Literature. He had been very hurt, he said, by Frederick Raphael
(some of whose early stories he published) describing him as a literary
beggar. He was hurt again by Alan Ross, editor of the London Magazine,
writing that people contributed to his review in order to get rid of him.
'A man who is sufficiently lunatic to publish eight numbers on Proust alone,
three on Balzac, or two on Dylan Thomas . . . This is not begging material]'
But you do at least have the gift of being able to talk people round?
'No. This was an idea of the BBC.' (BBC 2 made a programme about him). 'I am
not a sorcerer.'
Were there times when you tried desperately to get something and were
unsuccessful?
'I never try desperately. I persevere in a lyrical way, with great
enthusiasm. And I never became a nuisance. I was never a beggar.'
As proof of diligent research he could have added that among the people he
unearthed were a waiter friend of Marcel Proust's, Tolstoy's last secretary
and Franz Kafka's niece - who was living at Rottingdean on the English south
coast.
His publishing scoops include stories by Chekhov, letters by Dickens,
Berlioz, Andre Gide and Katherine Mansfield, a play by Sartre, poems by
Picasso (whose instant caricature of Adam's editor is shown above), sonnets
by Mozart's cataloguer Kochel, drawings by Cocteau and Henry Moore.
'I met many noble poets. I knew the great Paul Valery and went to see him
after liberation. He said something legendary and I have to boast when I
write my memoirs. It was: Vous etes le microbe dont nous avons besoin. 'You
are the virus which we need.' It was very fine metaphor.'
What exactly did he mean?
'He said that out of nothing I created a little magazine.'
Perhaps 'germ' is a better word, I said.
Grindea says he and his wife went on their knees and wept to persuade Dame
Myra Hess not to lock up her Steinway at the outbreak of war. He persuaded
Shaw to play some Beethoven, sat at Ezra Pound's bedside, bought orangeade
for Dylan Thomas, was encouraged by Graham Greene and Bertrand Russell, was
serenaded with a musical ditty by Darius Milhaud . . . and still he says he
is a desperate man.
Is it because of the way the English literati have treated you? Are they
jealous of your scoops?
'No, because I don't count. Really, I am not sentimentalising. I didn't
belong and I don't belong.'
Although, he said, 'the English shark tank is only small fry', he had never
been able to join the English literary crowd, to stand around in pubs
watching darts and drinking pint after pint. 'For me it's not a
weltanschauung.
'Every civilised Englishman on the Continent drinks his glass of cognac and
sits down like a human being. In this country, including the famous pubs
around Broadcasting House, the same Englishman becomes, not a beast, but a
different specimen.
'So I die an outsider. Just as Adam has been tolerated in this country, I
die as a sort of crank, as a man who doesn't understand cricket.'
Grindea is a magpie, an autograph-hunter in the true sense. He flatters
(women especially), yet in a manner so flowery as to seem quaint rather than
calculating. Naturally, he is feeling his age. But his self-pity and
pessimism struck me as more of a habit than a condition.
What would you like as your epitaph. Have you thought about that?
'No.' After reflection, he said: 'I would like that it be remembered that I
lived in Kensington, opposite the house where Angus Wilson lived and Eliot
in the mews next door; that I also lived for so many years, and that I
produced Adam.
'Adam, I think, will survive, if the atomic bomb doesn't hurt the British
Library or the Bibliotheque Nationale. Adam will survive by the editorials,
because I accumulated material which sometimes I spent three years for
research. This was my type of lunacy.
'Quand meme,' he reflected finally, 'I have done something.'
As I took my leave I thought that Grindea, who had been so perky on my
arrival, so animated by his reminiscences, looked crushed and empty. I felt,
in some obscure way, to blame. Was this ability to inspire guilt, I
wondered, after all the secret of Miron Grindea's seeming failure and
strange success?
