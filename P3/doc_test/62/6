'Years ago, when I was a boy, when there were wolves in Wales and birds like
red-flannelled petticoats . . .' Dylan Thomas: Return Journey, a one-man
show in which Bob Kingdom impersonates Thomas solely by reciting Thomas's
own words, gives pride of place to the best loved facet of Thomas - the
lyrical, satiric, comic, tender and elegiac prose poet of the bygone Wales
of his youth. Thomas can be as funnily picturesque on Wales as Dickens on
England and as acute and ironic as Joyce on Ireland. The show refers only to
Thomas's own self-destructive adulthood obliquely.
But Thomas was less interested in Wales, or in memory, than in words.
Listening to this show, you can tell why Edith Sitwell once wrote him a
fan-letter; and Gerald Manley Hopkins is another poet whose work comes to
mind. Thomas gets a high from sound itself, though in the long run his
over-indulgence serves to diminish him. Return Journey confirms my suspicion
that Thomas is a poet best enjoyed in adolescence (lines like 'his sulking
skulking cold black soul,' 'the old ramrod dying of downfall,' 'black
business bowlers bobbed before . . .'). Few of us, however, are so entirely
adult as to be proof against his lyric charm.
Bob Kingdom moves little, and his face moves less. You never quite get past
the fascination of just looking at him - is his head too large for his body?
or is his forehead too big for the rest of his face? or both? and is that
permanent expression of his a melancholy frown? - but mainly you hang on the
voice. It is, as he produces it here, an entirely Welsh voice, preacherly,
singerly, fruity and deadpan in its solemnity, as oddly cultivated in its
bygone accent as the BBC voices of the postwar years were in theirs.
No doubt but that in most respects Kingdom does Thomas to a T. This show -
directed by Anthony Hopkins, no less - is excellent, and most recommended to
all those who want to intoxicate themselves on words - words and fun. Who
could not love Thomas's descriptions of the useful and useless books of
boyhood? ('Books that told me everything about the wasp except why'?) He
adores making crazy lists: 'balletomanes, Max Factored actors, bigwigs and
humbugs . . . and men from the BBC who sound as if they had the Elgin
marbles in their mouths.'
It is eventually Thomas's over-use of devices as lists, alliterations and
half-rhymes that make him seem a minor artist. He is, nonetheless, absorbing
company. Return Journey's only fault is that it moves with an over-smooth
gear change into the more vehement poetry ('Do not go gentle'), which
therefore does not make its full effect.
The show's most interesting achievement is the way it shows Thomas's
detached presentation of himself. He sounds as lonely as one of Dickens's
heroes, and he uses the first person singular in an ironic post-Romantic
tone that often evokes Eliot. Making his way back to his Welsh boyhood, in
fact, he often sounds much like Peer Gynt.
In my review of Grace last Friday I mistakenly called Kristin Marks Kristin
Thomas. My apologies.
At the Lyric Studio, Hammersmith, until January 2
