Perhaps to see if you can go home again, Bob Dylan will make a rare concert 
appearance in his home state of Minnesota, performing Aug. 3 at the RiverFest 
in St. Paul. Dylan, who was born in Duluth and raised in Hibbing, started as a 
folk singer in a coffeehouse near the University of Minnesota in 1959 but has 
performed locally only three times since -- at the Minneapolis Auditorium in 
1965, the St. Paul Civic Center in 1978 and the Metrodome in 1986. ALEENE
