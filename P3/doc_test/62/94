Don and David Was -- the masterminds behind the avant-pop/funk group Was (Not 
Was) -- were in the studio finishing up their production work on the new Bob 
Dylan album, "Under the Red Sky," when an old friend of Dylan's, poet Allen 
Ginsberg, dropped by. It made a strange meeting of the minds just a little bit 
stranger, but seemed somehow appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"We were gonna finish mixing the album with the convocation of Rabbi Ginsberg," 
David Was remembers. "It was a great moment. It was like three generations of 
Jewish wiseguys in the room." 
</P>
<P>
A little too smart -- or smart-alecky -- for their own good, some would say of 
the Was brothers (who aren't really related). On their own deliciously 
diabolical, soulful records -- the most recent being "Are You Okay?" -- Don and 
David have mixed black comedy with black music, intellectual Jewish Angst with 
visceral dance beats, the urban with the urbane. 
</P>
<P>
Their refusal to "dumb it down" has cost them at times. Viewed as too 
schizophrenic, Was (Not Was) was unceremoniously dropped by its first two 
labels, Island and Geffen, after one record for each. 
</P>
<P>
After signing with Chrysalis in 1988, the group surprised skeptics by producing 
two left-field Top 10 hits ("Walk the Dinosaur" and "Spy in the House of Love") 
off its third album. Yet Was (Not Was) continues to confound pop stations, 
pundits and product managers alike. Now "Are You Okay?" is off to a slow start 
on the charts, despite reviews that have been much more than OK. 
</P>
<P>
Don Was admits that by operating on so many different levels, between the 
inherent incongruities of youth-conscious rhythms and sophisticated themes, the 
band risks alienating all camps at once. 
</P>
<P>
"If I try to take a step back and worry about it, I'll think that, well, it's 
got this dance texture on it so kids are gonna listen to it, but they're gonna 
see that we're talking about different, more grown-up stuff than Bobby Brown 
is, so in the end they'll be put off," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"And then the worry is that adults will hear all this beat stuff and won't be 
able to differentiate between us and 'Yo! MTV Raps,' and we're gonna put off 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
If the album ultimately does a belly-flop into the bargain bins occupied by 
some of its wiseguy predecessors, Don Was won't have to worry about keeping up 
the house payments. He's suddenly become a hot record producer. 
</P>
<P>
He steered Bonnie Raitt -- who was considered a has-been -- back into artistic 
and commercial glory, producing her Grammy-winning "Nick of Time" album. The 
B-52's exploded back into the Top 10 with his production of the single "Love 
Shack." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Dylan co-production with partner David, Don Was also has recordings 
either in the stores or in the works with Paula Abdul, Elton John, Bob Seger, 
the Knack, Michael McDonald, Dion, Leonard Cohen, Ozzy Osbourne, Voice of the 
Beehive, David Crosby and Iggy Pop. (See adjoining story, Page 51.) 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, just about everyone in pop music but Bobby Brown, who might 
want to add his name to Was' long waiting list now before it's entirely too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
David Was is really David Weiss -- the blond, goateed lyricist of the duo, 
prone to quoting obscure philosophical and scientific texts and puns in nearly 
equal measure; former jazz critic for the Los Angeles Herald Examiner and golf 
editor for City Sports, aspiring screenwriter, student of classical Greek, reed 
and keyboard player and crazed monologuist. 
</P>
<P>
He's the one who does the spoken-word raps like "Dad I'm in Jail," "Earth to 
Doris" and the new single "I Feel Better Than James Brown," usually in a 
sarcastic, tortured voice that sounds like a Beat Generation Bob Hope on acid. 
</P>
<P>
Don Was is in fact Don Fagenson -- the dark-haired, shades-wearing composer and 
bassist, the quietly confident studio whiz who reins in some of his partner's 
outermost instincts with tight, sharp melodies, a student of every sort of pop 
craftsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
These two have been collaborating ever since they met nearly three decades ago 
as junior high kids in Detroit, sharing a love while growing up of Dylan, the 
Mothers of Invention, John Coltrane and musical bourgeoisie-bashing in general. 
</P>
<P>
Says David, "I'd like to think that it's where Don and I meet . . . somewhere 
in the middle . . . that his more savvy instincts about what works meet my 
instincts of throwing in some element that shouldn't be there, and that our 
happy medium is where his smarts and my idiocy create a spark. 
</P>
<P>
"Although I've always held close my role as fly in the ointment, and realized 
that without Don being the ointment we'd have nothing to sell whatsoever, the 
fact is, if you unleash this guy, he is the ultimate pop ironist. He'll join 
two styles together faster than Wolfgang Puck can put raw chicken on a pizza." 
</P>
<P>
So though David publicly accused Don recently of having production instincts 
that are "embarrassingly commercial," he does approve of his partner's 
utilitarian indulgence in passing fads -- all the way down to the current 
album's "new jack swing" rhythms, which are popularly associated with, yes, 
Bobby Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"I borrow from a more highbrow culture T.S. Eliot's quote about how it's better 
to steal than to imitate," David says, "which I think in part was meant to 
explain why he ripped off passages from Homer and put them into 'The 
Wasteland.' And in a way I believe that if someone has said something well, it 
doesn't always pay to change it. 
</P>
<P>
"And pop music being as disposable as it is, I believe you're basically 
spitting in the wind of posterity and eternity anyway. You've got to hold 
yourself out to the moment. The moment is your mistress. 
</P>
<P>
"And if that means hewing to a certain beat, a beat that happens to be on the 
radio all the time, I tell you the truth, I'm married to the greatest groove 
thief in the Western world." 
</P>
<P>
Was (Not Was)'s origins, in fact, were with Don's excursions as an urban 
anthropologist into the dance clubs of Detroit, going out with a blaster tape 
recorder "to bag a couple of new grooves like some kind of disco Alan Lomax," 
says David. 
</P>
<P>
The rhythms he'd come back with were both fresh and floor-tested. Pop on a bass 
line, a paranoid lyric and a horn section using Middle Eastern modality -- and 
perhaps, in those pre-sampling days, a tape of, say, Reagan's State of the 
Union Address -- and you had seminal Was (Not Was). 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning we were radical dance music-makers because we were stealing 
fresh stuff and putting our own icing on it -- which I guess is the same crime 
you could accuse the Rolling Stones of, or Elvis. Maybe a little more 
perversely; I mean, we were turning rabbits into monsters." 
</P>
<P>
Was (Not Was) has employed such guest vocalists as Ozzy Osbourne, Mel Torme, 
Leonard Cohen and Frank Sinatra Jr. to sing those monstrous lyrics, but the 
main mouthpieces have always been Sir Harry Bowens (formerly of the O'Jays) and 
Sweet Pea Atkinson -- genuine vintage Detroit R&amp;B singers giving voice to 
the sorts of sentiments you're not likely to ever hear on black radio, or any 
kind of radio. 
</P>
<P>
If the lyrics often have a certain irony to begin with, the honest intensity 
and purity with which they're delivered by the two lead singers only heighten 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times I begin to write a song and know it's so far-fetched that when 
it's brought back down to Earth and delivered earnestly, that's when it'll 
acquire its charge," David says. 
</P>
<P>
"When I wrote 'I Blew Up the United States,' I knew you could let the bile drip 
and the spittle spew and just be another white punk screaming without a voice 
and sounding disturbing. But if you wrote a supple groove and put one of these 
soul men on it, it would sound like the perfect thing to do with a Sunday 
afternoon is go blow up the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Don is a major contributor to the irony as well, often applying the most 
cheerful melodies to the saddest lyrics. Even David was surprised when he 
turned in the words to "Maria Navarro" -- based on a news story about an East 
L.A. woman murdered by her husband after failing to persuade a 911 operator to 
dispatch a patrol car -- expecting a sorrowful ballad to come out of it. 
</P>
<P>
Later he was startled to find that Don had applied a definitive hip-hop beat to 
it, and David felt that dancing to someone else's tragedy might be out of even 
his off-center sphere of reference. 
</P>
<P>
The sense of subversiveness inherent in sneaking honest political or complex 
emotional nuggets into a slick, frothy pop-soul song isn't always intentional. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so much like a deliberate Trojan horse thing," Don claims. "I like to 
go to clubs, I like dance music. It's just another part of our vocabulary. The 
band was always built on that." 
</P>
<P>
And some songs are just legitimately silly. 
</P>
<P>
Says David, "With an hour's worth of music on a CD, you can put a scalpel 
inside your head and come up with a cross-section of a day's consciousness, 
like Joyce did in 'Ulysses.' 
</P>
<P>
"And part of you is just some heathen meat-eater concerned about your own 
survival, and another part of you is a fantasist, and another part of you is a 
bleeding-heart liberal responding to Maria Navarro, and another part of you is 
casting a jaundiced eye on modern romance. It's all part of the makeup of a 
normal day." 
</P>
<P>
At least when that was the day that Was. 
</P>
<P>
A normal day now is a day in which Don Was and David Was don't see each other. 
Don's production jobs are stacked up more than La Guardia in a blizzard, which 
gives David time to concentrate on the reason he first moved out to Los Angeles 
from Detroit: the film business. 
</P>
<P>
He's now developing a fact-based script for a major studio that he describes as 
"Ozzy Osbourne meets Francois Truffaut -- a coming of age heavy-metal picture." 
He will also act in and contribute music to a jazz-oriented movie that director 
Robert Altman will begin soon. (Both Wases appeared in "The Freshman," backing 
up Bert Parks on a unique interpretation of Dylan's "Maggie's Farm.") 
</P>
<P>
And Chrysalis has given him the go-ahead to make a solo album that will 
presumably take off from some of Was (Not Was)'s odder moments and go even 
deeper into space. His ultimate aspiration, he says with tongue only partially 
in cheek, is to fill the gaping niche now available for an American Luis 
Bunuel. 
</P>
<P>
"Don has found his bigger canvas, and in a way, the canvas he always wanted to 
be painting on -- just being a record-maker," David says. "It's a bit of fairy 
tale, and a bit of very inspiring go-get-'em American spirit. He put a football 
under one arm and a machine-gun under the other and just ran for the goal 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
"And I definitely need my own canvas too," adds David, whose ultimate hope is 
to add a great American play to his resume. "Was (Not Was) is a great thing to 
have, but I can't pretend it's all I want to do. I think if you have any 
pretensions about being a writer -- which in the end might be all I have -- 
that writing pop songs is like driving bump-'em cars at the carnival, compared 
to going out on the Indianapolis raceway. 
</P>
<P>
"Writing is a man's work, no sexism intended. I think a boy can write a pop 
song. Not that men haven't written great ones, but I can't see myself doing 
this with a cane in one hand and bifocals in the other. I need to test my 
mettle a little more than that."

eludes the public. Yet Don is the hot producer du jour, helping artists like 
Bonnie Raitt and the B-52s hit the mainstream. ELLEN JASKOL / Los Angeles Times
