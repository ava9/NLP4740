package - Kevin Done examines the challenge facing Juan Llorens when he
presents his plans at VW's HQ

Mr Juan Llorens, chief executive of Seat, has had barely six weeks to get to
grips with the beleaguered Spanish subsidiary of the Volkswagen group.
The mounting losses at the Spanish carmaker and the failure to produce a
convincing restructuring plan led to the summary departure of his
predecessor, Mr Juan Antonio Diaz Alvarez, at the end of September.
Tomorrow Mr Llorens will discover how well he passes muster at the
Volkswagen headquarters, when he presents Seat's latest response to its
mounting financial crisis to the VW supervisory board.
Mr Llorens, previously the head of the Spanish motor industry confederation,
faces the task of wringing out of the supervisory board the further
financial backing that Seat desperately needs to ride out the present storm.
'The boat is sailing in a very rough sea,' said Mr Llorens yesterday.
Important parts of his rescue package, including the negotiation of a 10 per
cent pay cut for the entire Seat workforce, are still to be completed, but
at least Mr Llorens has won the reluctant backing this week of the Spanish
authorities and trade unions for a drastic cut in the Seat workforce that
will be unprecedented in its severity.
In the face of losses at Seat that may now mount to around DM2bn (Dollars
1.2bn), including a DM600m restructuring provision, and dramatic
overcapacity, Volkswagen was no longer willing to accept any plans from the
company that were prepared on optimistic forecasts for an early recovery in
the European new car market.
The restructuring plan that Mr Llorens will present tomorrow is now based on
the closure of Seat's oldest assembly plant at Zona Franca in Barcelona.
Seat is being forced to consolidate all its car assembly at its new
Martorell plant on the outskirts of Barcelona. The plant already makes the
Ibiza hatchback and related Cordoba saloon cars launched during the last 12
months.
Now Seat plans to move production of its larger Toledo family car from Zona
Franca to Martorell during the first half of next year. The dramatic
concentration of Seat production will mean that the company will be forced
to abandon the A-class segment of the European car market.
By late next year it will have been forced to give up production altogether
of the Marbella small car, a range which was derived from the Fiat Panda.
Now the product development cupboard is bare for Seat in this segment of the
market. It must sink or swim with its present product range, although it
will add a new small car-derived van in 1995 at the Martorell plant. This
will be derived from the Ibiza and will replace the Marbella-based Terra van
range, which will be abandoned next year.
Under the terms of the restructuring plan agreed with the Catalonia
government on Wednesday, Seat is planning to cut 9,000 jobs from a group
workforce that totalled 23,756 at the end of October.
At the Zona Franca plant, where car assembly will cease during the second
half of next year, it is eliminating 2,978 jobs through the early retirement
of workers aged 55 and more. It has also won the support of the authorities
to lay off a further 4,616 workers at the plant for a maximum of two years
for each worker during the three years from 1994 to 1996. In addition it is
eliminating up to 1,400 more temporary contract jobs.
The earlier plans for the expansion of Seat have turned out to be hopelessly
over-optimistic in the face of the widespread recession in west European new
car markets. Seat now has an installed capacity to produce 780,000 cars a
year at its two plants, Zona Franca and Martorell, Mr Llorens said
yesterday.
In fact output of cars under the Seat brand - excluding production of the VW
Polo at the Pamplona plant in northern Spain - is expected to total only
296,000 this year. Seat is currently forecasting a production level of at
least 320,000 for 1994, but Mr Llorens said yesterday that with some
additional investment, capacity at Martorell alone could be increased to
500,000 vehicles a year.
After the transfer of all car assembly to Martorell, Seat will still have a
workforce of around 2,900 left at the Zona Franca plant that will be engaged
largely in the remaining press-shop, foundry and sub-assembly operations.
The big challenge facing the company will be the creation of a 'supplier
park' at the Zona Franca plant, where Seat hopes to attract automotive
components suppliers that can establish operations to take on some of Seat's
remaining surplus labour.
Under the agreement reached this week the 4,616 Zona Franca workers that are
to be laid off for up to two years, could return to Seat at the end of the
period.
'We are going to create a taskforce on Monday, which will have three years
to re-locate all these people,' said Mr Llorens yesterday. 'It is not going
to be easy. Our objective is that the number of people coming back at the
end of 1996 will be zero.'
To help reach that target and also cut its purchasing costs, Seat aims to
increase the share of components it buys in Spain from 54 per cent at
present to 67 per cent by 1996, which calls for the re-location of parts
purchases totalling Pta32bn (Dollars 228m).
