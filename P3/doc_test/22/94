THIS IS a buyer's market for big houses and also for fine city homes in easy
reach of the country. One of the more attractive area to begin the search is
Oxfordshire: along the Thames valley, the M4 corridor and in Oxford, the
city of dreaming spires. In spite of the popularity of the country, there
are bargains to be had.
Oxford governs life in the south half of the county and along its borders.
That often puts a premium on house prices but the area has many attractions.
Communications, schools and medicine are excellent. The university has its
dons glad to be invited to dinner away from other dons. There are plenty of
places for walks and expeditions and rich art and music. In Oxford, the
touring opera companies fill the Apollo Theatre and outside the city
Garsington Opera gives a glimpse of how Glyndebourne was in the 30s.
Trains for commuters to London are quick and buses cheap and frequent. The
M4, M40 and A34 lead to the airports and every part of England.
There is a lively life outside the university - though you may soon find
your conversation dominated by talk of schools or of the traffic jams when
it is time to collect the little darlings. It is hard to find the old sense
of a county town in Oxford: some of it is now to smart - Liberty in the High
Street - and some too tatty, such as the fast food outlets.
Among the most appealing properties are the Victorian Gothic houses of North
Oxford even though many are semi-detached. They are solid, spacious family
houses with gardens awash with pink spring blossom. But one must be patient.
Whole houses are rare on the market as many have become university offices,
language schools or flats.
Two examples are on the market. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (0865-790077) offer 12
St Margaret's Road, in red brick, at pounds 325,000, and Cluttons
(0865-793900), 3 Warnborough Road, in yellow brick, at pounds 345,000.
A smart flat on a long lease at 165 Woodstock Road, is on sale at pounds
265,000, with John E Wood (0865-311522). Wood also offer a house in Park
Town. This was North Oxford's first development, built in 1850s in yellow
brick and stucco and in the Classical style. The house, 53 Park Town, needs
refurbishment but pounds 270,000 is a good price for the best address in
Oxford - if you are not head of a college and in the usual handsome house
with the job.
Oxfordshire straddles the border between the brick land of southern England
and the stone of the rest of the country. From Henley, in the south-east
corner of the county, through the Vale of the White Horse, to Wantage and
beyond, and up to Abingdon, almost all the houses are brick, although a few
are half-timbered wattle and daub. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Hungerford
(0488-682726) are selling two such farmhouses near Wantage. But in the hilly
ground north of Oxford, where the Cotswolds cut up to the Cherwell valley,
stone rules.
Stonehill, near Abingdon, with 27 acres, barns, swimming pool and tennis
court, at pounds 780,000, from Cluttons, is a brick house at its grandest.
So is the stuccoed Blackstone House, in the splendidly-named village of
Brightwell-cum-Sotwell, four miles from Didcot (35 minutes by train to
Paddington). Cluttons are agents and the guide price is pounds 550,000.
Near Henley, Savills (0491-579990) are selling the brick and half-timbered
Rotherfield Grange with 226 acres of farm for around pounds 1.5m. The house
has elaborate security. A ring fence surrounds it and you enter through
'electronically operated wrought-iron gates' monitored by closed-circuit TV.
Nearby is the Glebe House (a Victorian rectory) at Dunsden, where Wilfred
Owen, the World War I poet, once lived. Savills and Lane Fox (0734-845757)
offer the house at pounds 500,000.
Place Manor in Streatley is on the market for pounds 25,000 less. It is an
attractive half-timbered and brick building nestling in the Thames valley.
The house is on sale with Strutt &amp; Parker (0635-521707). Nearby Westbury
Farm at Purley, seems to be the only place in the country that makes a good,
full-bodied English red wine. Aspirant vintners, here is your chance at
pounds 650,000 (through Savills). The house also has fishing lakes stocked
with trout.
In the stone belt, Jackson-Stops (0285-653334) offer the Milk House at
Purton, between Swindon and Cirencester at pounds 197,500. It is a dream of
a thatched cottage which sits by a stream.
Two attractive houses in Burford are on the market. The 19th century
Waterloo Farmhouse at Fulbrook has stabling and paddocks and is ideal for
hunting with the Heythrop, it is being handled by Strutt &amp; Parker in
Moreton-in-Marsh (0608-50502). Ladyham, on the market for pounds 700,000
with Jackson-Stops, or Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, has a long frontage on the
river Windrush, which meanders through the garden. It has 18 acres of river
meadow.
Fans of Iris Murdoch, the novelist, or of her husband, John Bayley, the
critic, may be attracted to their old house, Cedar Lodge, in Steeple Aston,
a large village above the Cherwell, that has suffered from noise from Upper
Heyford air base, but the USAF leaves soon. It is a fine house in spruce
state, hardly recalling the days when Professor Bayley would mow a path to
the front door for the lunch guests. Cluttons offer it at pounds 485,000
and, nearer Oxford, the Old Vicarage at Cassington at pounds 535,000.
At Chadlington, in the Evenlode valley, the manor, currently a country house
hotel, is going at pounds 930,000 (Knight Frank &amp; Rutley) and could continue
as a hotel or revert to being a family house. Pool Farm, at Stratton Audley,
near Bicester, has a more surprising business on its 260 acres. It is the
headquarters of the London Rally School. John D Wood offer it in lots for a
total pounds 735,000.
Chandlings Manor, by Bagley Wood, on the hills south-west of Oxford, is a
pleasure dome of extreme opulence built by Farid Wakim, sold in 1990 for
over pounds 5m and in 1991 for pounds 2.5m and now on offer for pounds
1.95m, from Savills in London (071-499-8644). Where else can you get a
casino, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, rifle range, squash court,
cinema, floodlit gardens, stables and garaging for 21 cars, and much more in
the most expensive taste, at such a snip of a price? The dons will come out
in droves to marvel. The desert-tented drawing room calls to mind the lines
of Matthew Arnold in The Scholar Gipsy: 'on the skirts of Bagley Wood, Where
most the Gipsies buy the turf-edg'd way Pitch their smok'd tents.'
