golfing friend Jenkins spend a long weekend in Portugal

YOU MIGHT not have met my friend Jenkins. Jenkins spent years attending to
mundane matters so that he could throw himself at one of life's greater
challenges: reducing his golf handicap to scratch. He is quite close now,
playing off five at Sunningdale. He reminds me of the man who, when asked
how much golf he was playing, replied: 'Only days.'
When I invited him for a long weekend's golf on Portugal's Algarve coast,
there was a nanosecond of indecision. He was competing in the Sunningdale
foursomes. He is always playing in something. 'I'd love to,' he said. 'When
can we go?'
We were to stay at the Quinta do Lago hotel and play golf on Quinta's A, B,
C and D courses and at Vila Sol. Was it a feasible venue for a long
weekend's golf or not?
First day. The sun on our backs felt good as we piled the car high with
clubs and drove slowly out of Faro airport. Jenkins rubbed his hands in
anticipation of the golf we were going to play. 'The turf will be like
velvet, the greens so fast and true I will not have to cock my wrists and do
a full pivot,' he said. And then he gave a little whimper of excitement.
When we checked in at the hotel, a receptionist smiled and wished me a happy
birthday. Waiting for me in my room was a birthday cake. I rang to book a
massage and as we concluded the conversation the masseuse said, with a
tinkling laugh: 'Happy birthday, Mr Hopkins.' I wondered whether there was
anyone in Portugal who did not know it was my birthday.
My room overlooked a wildlife sanctuary and a sandy beach beyond. I rang
Jenkins and suggested an exploratory walk. He was shocked. 'I thought we
would play nine holes before supper.' The hotel receptionists found a
tee-time for us and within half-an-hour we were battling against a strong,
biting wind.
Second day. Vila Sol, a few miles up the road, had staged the Portuguese
Open the week before our visit and we were able to play the course from the
same tees. The driving range was one of the best I have seen in Europe with
regular yardage markers, firm turf from which to hit and good balls, far
superior to the pawky range and mangy balls at Quinta.
Though it only covers 100 of the available 300 acres, the Vila Sol course is
tight and it will be much tighter when the 240 villa homes and 310
apartments are sold. It will then be reminiscent of some of the golf
development in Spain, and I can't say worse than that. Too tight, I thought
to myself on the second hole as I retrieved my ball from plot D6-3 on the
right of the fairway.
Third day. At 6.30am it is dark and cold, even on the Algarve in late March.
Domingos da Silva, the managing director of Quinta, was wearing only shorts.
He knew it would warm up. Soon the temperature was a comfortable 65' or so.
Da Silva was accompanied by Stuart Woodman, director of golf at Trafalgar
House's Vilar do Golf resort on Quinta.
Da Silva, an ebullient Portuguese, took up golf only recently. He had a
hockey player's short backswing and something approaching John Daly's power.
He talked and walked fast and swung even faster, as though he resented
having to be silent for the few seconds it took him to hit the ball.
Sometimes he talked throughout his swing.
'The first time I played with Domingos he hit a three-iron further than I've
ever seen,' said Woodman, a former touring pro. 'But he lacks a little in
finesse. On another occasion he hit a huge drive to within 30 yards of the
green, and when I came upon him he was about to play his second shot with
his driver as well. 'You can't use your driver, Domingos' I said. 'Why not?'
he replied. 'It worked so well for the last shot I thought I'd use it
again'.'
After our round we sat in the sun and sipped our beer, dreamily looking at
some of the trees that make up the biggest collection of umbrella pines in
the world. The faces around us were bronzed and smiling. The language was
predominantly English.
Fourth and fifth days. Another early start. It was barely light when we hit
our first drives on the two other nines at Quinta that we had not yet
played. After 99 holes in four days, my hands were blistered and my golf
seemed to be getting worse. But Jenkins was in his element. 'I must say that
if I had to play this course for the rest of my life I would not mind,' he
said.
At a time when so many new golf courses are just too hard for average
golfers, it was refreshing to be able to cope with Quinta's four nine-hole
lay-outs. Not every par 4 required a long iron or even a wood for a second
shot.
There was time on the flight home to assess the merits of Quinta do Lago as
a venue for a weekend's golf. It has much to commend it over many places
nearer Britain, not least the proximity of the hotel to the airport (20
minutes). Overall, my journey was less than six hours door-to-door (I live
in north London). Furthermore, the flights work conveniently: it is possible
to play golf on arriving at the hotel, and before departing. All this - plus
guaranteed sunshine.
John Hopkins flew c/o British Airways and was a guest of the Quinta do Lago
hotel. Five and eight-day holidays inclusive of accommodation, breakfast and
evening meals, guaranteed tee times and green fees (18 holes each day) at
Quinta do Lago, Vila Sol or Vale do Lobo golf courses are available from
approximately Pounds 335 and Pounds 605 respectively per person. Also
included are transfers to Quinta do Lago golf course and one hour of tennis.
