Seventy years ago, winter was the high season on the French Riviera. Once
the railway opened along the coast, it took only 31 hours from London to
Nice. And in the novel Tender Is the Night, Scott Fitzgerald wrote about a
hotel near Cannes which (in 1925) 'was almost deserted after its English
clientele went north in April.'
Later in the 1920s, the sun cult took over and life has never been the same.
Estate agents now must always emphasise the possibilities for sunbathing.
Villas have gobbled up the Mediterranean hillsides and swimming pools have
been blasted from the rock. Money has submerged the old fishing villages as
the centre of the region has tilted from the inland towns such as Aix,
Avignon and Nimes to the coast.
Is anything left in this rich garden of hedonism that ordinary people can
afford? Yes, if you look hard. But it might have to be an apartment, or a
house over to the south-west towards Toulouse.
The Romans, who gave Provence its name - it was in the provincia (province)
of Gallia Narbonensis - must have found it an extension of Italy with its
rocks, prickly scrub, thyme, sun and olive trees (olives in France grow only
in the south coastal zone and up the Rhone valley).
The Greeks would have thought the same. Many centuries earlier, they founded
Marseilles and started one of the greatest of their many contributions to
civilisation - making wine in France.
Hardly anything else survives of the Greek tradition, but Arles, Orange and
Nimes have splendid Roman remains while Avignon is a magnet for those
interested in the Middle Ages. Nature-lovers can choose between the rock
plateau of Les Baux (which gave its name to bauxite, mined nearby) to the
marshes of the Camargue, the delta at the mouth of the Rhone where migrating
flamingoes rest.
For art fanciers, galleries abound with Impressionists; Mont Ste-Victoire,
dominating the A6 motorway, is immediately familiar from Cezanne's
paintings. Cuisine is strong on garlic, tomatoes and fish.
Sarah Francis, of Sifex, says it is difficult in Provence to find a house of
character for less than FFr2m (about Pounds 226,000), even though prices
have come down around 30-40 per cent in local terms since 1988/89. On the
other hand, the franc stays strong. But with France expected to come out of
recession in about a year, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's Patrick Dring feels this
could be an excellent time to buy.
Bargains are few, however, and chances are best in new developments where
you might pick up the last apartment in the block at a good price, or with
an extra like the garage thrown in. 'There is no harm making an offer. In a
quiet market, you might be lucky,' says Hilary Katz, of Azur Internationale
in Cannes.
For FFr1.1m, she offers a ground floor flat in Cannes near the Old Port,
with a swimming pool in the gardens. For FFr2.35m, there is a top floor flat
in a development which also has two tennis courts. Outside Antibes, Sifex is
selling a flat with sea view for FFr1.5m; and John Taylor offers two, both
on the top floor, for FFr2.1m or FFr2.65m.
Villas on offer start at FFr1.45m (down from FFr1.65m, perhaps because it
does not have a pool) at Mougins, the cobbled village near Cannes and
Antibes (from Azur International). Ten minutes' drive from there, Azur is
selling a bastide (farmhouse), also lacking a pool, for FFr2.7m. At
Roquefort les Pins, the agent has a villa with heated pool and garden
(olives and figs included) for FFr2.8m.
For FFr18m, there are Beauhavre, a lovely villa looking south across the bay
of St-Tropez to the town (Knight Frank &amp; Rutley or Hugo Skillington) and La
Porte des Iles at Mougins (Aylesford). Cheaper (from KFR) are the Villa
Constance at Grimaud for FFr11m and, inland at the medieval hill village of
Villecroze, a beautifully-restored farmhouse called La Ferrage St Jean for
FFr6m.
Most costly is the 1972 Villa Mabasque at St Paul de Vence for FFr22m
(Hamptons or John Taylor in St Paul). Reduced from FFr29m, the price
includes a 1957 Rolls Royce - not, however, an ideal car for the steep,
narrow roads.
La Bergerie at St Antonin-du-Var, another old inland village, costs FF6.9m
(GAK Williamson). Alternatively, the vendor will sell one-third freehold
shares for FFr2.3m through a British company. This makes sense, as few
second home-owners spend more than four months a year at their property -
yet they pay for 12 months' maintenance. To help out with costs, the house
and its guest-house take up to 14 people.
The same agent offers a village house in St Christol, between Nimes and
Montpellier, for FFr1.575m.
Inland, in the Luberon valley north of Aix, Coldstone House has an old
property ready for occupation in the village of Roussillon for FFr1.96m, and
modern houses in Lacoste for FFr 1.1m or 2.5m.
At the top end of the scale, FFr4.5m will secure the wing of a medieval
castle, needing work, for around FFr1.5m, and FFr8m buys a magnificent
bastide with seven bedrooms.
Adams House Management, Coldstone's sister company, will look after
everything - including the builder to do any renovations. Partner Christian
Adams finds the Luberon market more active since September. No large
developments spoil the ambience of a lovely part of France, and the wine is
good.
The best buys, however, are further away in the south-west of France using
Toulouse or Bordeaux airports. Sifex is selling a restored farmhouse near
Montauban with about 16 hectares, including a two-hectare (five-acre)
vineyard, for FFr1.65m, and a house on the river Lot for FFr1.59m. This has
a boathouse and a pool, too.
