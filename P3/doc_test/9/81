  [Text] Russia and the People's Democratic Republic of Korea 
are interested in overcoming the current lull in bilateral 
relations and broadening contacts in the political, economic and 
other spheres, which is clear from the visit of North Korean 
diplomats led by the deputy foreign minister, Director of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry's Information and Press Department 
Grigoriy Karasin said during a briefing on Thursday. 
  He announced that the North Korean delegation had held talks 
with deputy foreign ministers Igor Ivanov, Aleksandr Panov and 
Georgiy Mamedov. 
  To quote Karasin, the talks dealt with the establishment of 
inter-parliamentary contacts, with the resumption of the work of 
the inter-governmental consultative commission for economic, 
scientific and technical problems, with the creation of joint 
ventures, with broadening direct contacts between Siberian and 
Far Eastern regions, and with the drafting of a new agreement on 
joint lumbering in the Khabarovsk Territory and Amursk Region. 
  Karasin stated that nuclear problems had been discussed in 
great detail. "Russia favors tougher observance of the 
nonproliferation regime in Korea in accordance with the 
nonproliferation treaty and with the agreement on guarantees 
between North Korea and the IAEA," he said. Moscow also 
welcomes North Korea's latest steps to facilitate the IAEA 
inspection of the north Korean nuclear facilities which began 
last March. 
  The possibility of replacing the armistice agreement with a 
peace agreement which North Korea would like to sign with the 
U.S. was also discussed. "Russia believes that at the current 
stage, armistice is the only way of safeguarding peace in Korea. 
It can be replaced, though, on the basis of mutual agreement of 
all the parties concerned," he said. 
  He said that the North Korean delegation had expressed a 
positive attitude to the Russian proposal on convening an 
international conference on the settlement of the situation in 
the Korean peninsula. "Both parties are convinced that the 
problems facing the Korean Peninsula must be settled peacefully, 
through talks, without pressure and with due account taken of 
the interests of all states," said Karasin.
