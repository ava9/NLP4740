  [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS -- The reports of some mass 
media that Russian scientists participated in creation of 
nuclear weapons in Pyongyang absolutely contradict the reality, 
Ambassador of North Korea in Moscow Son Sung-pil told ITAR-TASS 
on Friday. 
  North Korea never had a military nuclear programme. The 
research in atomic energy was of an exclusively peaceful 
character, he noted. 
  The ambassador said the former Soviet Union rendered 
assistance to North Korea in various spheres. In those years, 
Soviet specialists, including nuclear energy experts, worked in 
the republic. However, now there are no Russian atomic experts 
in North Korea. 
  According to Son Sung-pil, Japanese mass media are 
initiators 
of various fabrications on the topic. It is not by accident, 
because "Japan has all the necessary components for creating 
nuclear weapons", he said. 
  "It is quite possible that certain circles of that country 
are interested that the world community's attention is attracted 
by the fuss about the alleged threat from North Korea, using it 
as a ground and excuse to create their own atomic bomb", the 
ambassador stressed.
