<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Eloquent U.S. Deputy Secretary of </F>
State Talbott Expected To Work Out Measures To Deal With Russia 
in Confusion"] 
  [Text] Within the staggering Clinton Administration -- 
already burdened by the questionable diplomatic ability of 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and doubled troubles in 
the wake of the resignation of Defense Secretary Les Aspin -- 
Mr. Strobe Talbott, who replaced Clifford Wharton as Deputy 
Secretary of State, emerges as a key diplomatic personality. 
  The new deputy secretary, Talbott, in contrast to poor 
talker 
Secretary of State Christopher, is a glib talker. Basically, 
the deputy secretary of state is in charge of interdepartmental 
affairs within the Department of State. In the case of Mr. 
Talbott, however, he is likely to have many chances to attract 
public attention at news conferences. 
  Besides, Deputy Secretary Talbott is a universally 
acknowledged expert on Russia, which is plagued with mounting 
confusion. 
  Mr. Talbott began studying the Russian language when he was 
a 
student at Hotchkiss, a famed prep school in the Eastern U.S., 
and studied Russian literature at Yale University and at Oxford 
which he attended as a Rhodes scholar along with President 
Clinton. He is also known for translating the memoirs of former 
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev at the age of 24. 
  After graduating from universities he worked at TIME 
magazine 
as an expert reporter on the former Soviet Union and Russian 
affairs. He was reported to have indulged himself in Russian 
affairs even while the Washington bureau chief, reporting on 
U.S. affairs as a whole. After his 30-year-long immersion in 
Russia, he can rightly be termed a "Russophile." 
  His excessively partial concern for Russia is seen as a 
little problematic, but he is counted on by many for his 
expertise on Russia, where tension and instability continue to 
mount. It is because a blueprint for rebuilding Russia drawn up 
by the United States and the International Monetary Fund has 
greatly gotten out of shape due to the rise of ultranationalist 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, and the resignation of reformist First 
Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar, and the expressed 
resignation of Economics Minister Fedorov who have pursued 
economic democratization and the like. 
  Meanwhile, a noticeable No. 2 man in Japan's Russian 
diplomacy appeared on stage when Japan-Russia relations were not 
making any improvement even after Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's formal visit to Japan, as shown by such activities as 
Russia's dumping radioactive wastes in the Sea of Japan. 
  Recently Koji Watanabe, former ambassador to Italy, was 
appointed ambassador to Russia, but he is not quite an expert on 
Russian affairs. So Kazuhiko Togo, former minister to the 
United States, was called in to assist Ambassador Watanabe. 
  Mr. Togo not only has the experience of serving in Moscow 
some time ago but also was the Soviet Union Division chief at 
the Foreign Ministry when the then President Mikhail Gorbachev 
visited Japan. In addition, Mr. Togo, when he was in the United 
States as minister at the Japanese Embassy, was said to have 
developed a strong friendship with Deputy Secretary of State 
Talbott. 
  It remains to be seen how much influence these two No. 2 men 
can exert on future Japan-U.S.-Russia relations.
