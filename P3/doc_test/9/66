  [Text] Thailand will soon open its first embassy in the 
North Africa region in Rabat, the capital of Morocco. 
  "Now that the European Community has formed the single 
market, Thailand considers Morocco as the gateway to the EC 
market," the new Ambassador Narong Khemayothin said. 
  "It will also be the springboard to African countries," he 
told reporters yesterday. 
  Morocco and Thailand established diplomatic ties in 1985. 
Narong said establishing the embassy in Rabat would help 
tighten bilateral relations and later help to increase economic 
cooperation. Thailand currently has a trade surplus with the 
North African kingdom. In 1992, Morocco bought Bt [baht] 213 
million worth of Thai rubber, textiles, equipment parts and 
thread for fishing nets, while its exports of canned fish and 
anchovy, as well as cotton, to Thailand was valued at Bt79 
million. 
  "The trade value is not yet high but we see Morocco as a 
potential production base for fisheries, textiles, as well as 
tourism," the ambassador said. He said Thai investors should 
consider investing in Morocco as there was little foreign 
investment there now. 
  "There will not be fierce competition as there was only 
US$500 million worth of foreign investment in Morocco in 1992," 
he said. Most of that came from Spain, South Korea and China. 
  According to Narong, Morocco has an unlimited quota for its 
textiles from the EU [European Union] market, which could 
benefit Thai businesses if their products were manufactured 
there. 
  Narong said the embassy was expected to be operating next 
month as soon as Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan is 
available to officially host the opening ceremony.
