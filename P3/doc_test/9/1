<F P=106> [Viktor Zamyatin, Sergey Tsekhmistrenko report: "Personnel </F>
Shakeup in Russian Foreign Ministry. Minister Will Have New 
Deputies"] 
  [Text] The just completed New Year and Christmas season 
has brought about more changes in Russian diplomacy. According 
to information available to KOMMERSANT-DAILY, the question of 
appointing Aleksandr Panov, the current ambassador to Seoul, as 
deputy foreign minister, has for all intents and purposes been 
resolved. It has come to light simultaneously that Igor Ivanov, 
ambassador to Madrid, will probably become yet another deputy 
for Andrey Kozyrev. 
  Georgiy Kunadze, whose place will probably be taken by 
Aleksandr Panov, was in charge of Foreign Ministry personnel 
policy and relations with the countries of Asia and the Pacific 
region. Kunadze was not quite successful in the personnel job, 
though, some high-ranking diplomats note. One of the probable 
reasons is the fact that he has not been a career diplomat 
(before joining the Ministry of Foreign Affairs he was in 
academic science), which is why they argue on Smolenskaya 
Ploshchad that he could not entirely get rid of his "outsider" 
image. Last October, personnel work was entrusted to an 
"insider" -- Sergey Krylov -- and some time later, the question 
of Kunadze's appointment as ambassador to Seoul was resolved in 
principle. This leaves the Asia and Pacific region "untended," 
and now Aleksandr Panov is to step into this breach. 
  As for Igor Ivanov, according to some information, he is 
tipped to take the place of current First Deputy Minister 
Anatoliy Adamishin, who has become a member of parliament. It 
is still not clear, though, which Foreign Ministry areas he will 
be in charge of if one thinks that changes in the ministry's 
structure (and the redistribution of duties among top diplomats 
it entails) have not been yet completed.
