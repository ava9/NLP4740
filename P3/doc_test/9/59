  [Text] Vatican City, Jan 19 (AFP) -- Pope John Paul II on 
Wednesday [19 January] named Nuncio Andrea Cordero Lanza di 
Montezemolo as the Vatican's special representative to Israel, 
following an agreement to normalise relations. 
  Di Montezemolo, 68, is currently apostolic delegate to 
Jerusalem and Jordan and pro-nuncio to Cyprus. 
  Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said last month that the 
appointee would keep his other functions, as representative of 
the Vatican to the local churches, and would reside at the 
Franciscan community at Jaffa, near Tel Aviv. 
  Born in Turin, di Montezemolo is a seasoned Vatican diplomat 
and was one of the drafters of the December 30 agreement with 
Israel. 
  In a reciprocal move, Israel on Wednesday appointed Shmuel 
Hadas as its representative to the Holy See, the Israeli Foreign 
Ministry said. 
  The Vatican had opposed Israel's first choice, Rabbi David 
Rosen, suggesting it preferred a career diplomat for the post. 
  Hadas was born in Argentina in 1931 and emigrated to Israel 
in 1954, settling in the Nir-Am kibbutz, before joining the 
foreign service ten years later. 
  In 1986 he was appointed Israel's first ambassador to Spain. 
Since 1987, he has run the Foreign Ministry's Cultural and 
Scientific Affairs Department, doubling as adviser to Foreign 
Minister Shimon Peres. 
  Israel and the Vatican have agreed to establish diplomatic 
relations at the ambassadorial level within four months of last 
month's accord.
