<F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev report: "President's Directive Signed </F>
But Still No Clarity. Appointments of 20 Russian Ambassadors 
Delayed"] 
  [Text] According to informed sources, the other day 
President Boris Yeltsin signed an internal directive on the 
procedure for appointing and approving Russian ambassadors 
abroad. 
  This process came to a standstill without even starting, 
literally after the entry into effect of the new Russian 
Federation Constitution, whose provisions regarding the 
procedure for appointing ambassadors caused friction in 
relations between the Foreign Ministry and the Federal 
Assembly's international committees, which aspire to the role of 
active participants rather than passive observers of the 
consideration and solution of questions of this kind. The 
Constitution prescribes that appointments are made by the 
president by agreement with the appropriate parliamentary 
committees. The term "by agreement" has become a stumbling 
block: Does it mean that, for example, committees can block a 
particular nomination proposed by the head of state, or is it 
merely the case that the president will acquaint himself with 
the opinion of the committee members but will make the final 
decision exclusively at his own discretion? 
  Behind-the-scenes disputes have turned into a situation 
whereby for the last five months or so not a single nomination 
has been submitted to parliament for agreement. Consequently, a 
number of key ambassadorial posts -- first and foremost in the 
United States -- remain unfilled. On the whole, according to 
information from informed sources, around 20 appointments are 
currently "pending." 
  Without going into the substance of the president's 
directive 
in detail, in conversation with IZVESTIYA Deputy Foreign 
Minister Sergey Krylov gave an approximate outline of what the 
appointment process will be: Submitted nominations will be 
discussed in closed parliamentary hearings and only in closed 
hearings so that, the deputy minister said, "ethics are not 
violated and future ambassadors' names are not publicized before 
these ambassadors have received the host country's agreement." 
The Constitution, Krylov stressed, does not place limitations 
on the president in his final choice of a particular ambassador. 
In other words, even if the nomination is rejected by 
parliamentary committees the president is nonetheless fully 
entitled to approve it. 
  Similarly citing diplomatic ethics, Krylov refused to say in 
which specific countries changes will take place in the near 
future, merely observing that, because a Russian ambassador had 
recently died in a Latin American state, there would naturally 
be a new appointment there. 
  Meanwhile, in the State Duma I was informed that there could 
be talk only of open hearings, which will be closed to 
unauthorized persons only when it is necessary to consider 
confidential information. But the parliamentary committees' 
decisions, submitted directly to the president, will in fact be 
secret. 
  "Can the president," I enquired, "insist that the hearings 
be 
closed?" 
  "No," the Duma sources replied, "because the nature of the 
hearings is determined by internal parliamentary regulations 
which have already been approved." 
  After talking to representatives of the Duma, Foreign 
Ministry, and presidential staff you are unlikely to conclude 
that even now, with the signing of the directive, all problems 
have finally been solved and the process of filling vacancies 
and "rotating" ambassadors will get into full swing, although 
this is what Russia's foreign policy interests demand.
