"Suspicion of the Status of Kim Pyong-il Who Returned Amid Rumor 
on His Seeking Political Asylum--Discord With Kim Chong-il Over 
Succession to Power"] 
  [Text] "The cases in which Kim Chong-il has exercised his 
power have been considerably reduced and major policies, 
including the nuclear issue, are being directly handled by Kim 
Il-song," and "Kim Chong-il's face, occasionally seen in public, 
does not look healthy, thus causing the people to suspect that 
something unusual is happening." Amid this situation, the 
observation that Kim Chong-il's position "is not firm" was 
quickly raised since the 21st plenary meeting of the sixth party 
Central Committee was held last December. Kim Chong-il's close 
associates, including Kim Tal-hyon, were demoted during the 
session. Under these circumstances, the movements of Kim 
Pyong-il, Kim Chong-il's half brother, are also arousing the 
people's suspicion. 
  This suspicion was prompted by the fact that Kim Pyong-il, 
who was appointed North Korean ambassador to Finland last March, 
returned to North Korea after serving only a month and a half in 
Finland, and has remained in North Korea for over a month for no 
apparent reason. 
  Kim Pyong-il did not attend a dinner arranged by the Finnish 
president for new foreign ambassadors, and hastily left Finland. 
Then, what was the reason behind Kim Pyong-il returning to his 
home country without even attending the dinner arranged by the 
president of a host country, which is regarded as an important 
event for diplomats? 
  First, people believe that he was summoned home for the 
purpose of preventing him from seeking political asylum or other 
possible unexpected acts. According to the rumor, on his way to 
the Helsinki airport to return to North Korea, Kim Pyong-il 
muttered that "It would have been better if I had sought 
political asylum." 
  It is a well-known fact that Kim Pyong-il has been subjected 
to various types of controls by Kim Chong-il. Kim Pyong-il, 
after completing the Namsan senior middle school in 1970, 
graduated from the department of politics and economy at the Kim 
Il-song University in 1976. He was then commissioned as an 
officer of the Ministry of People's Armed Forces (rank was 
unknown). 
  After graduating from the Kim Il-song Military College in 
August of 1981, Kim Pyong-il was assigned as military attache at 
the North Korean Embassy in Yugoslavia, and served until 1983. 
He served in the General Bureau of Security Guard for four years 
from 1984, and thus served in a post close to his father. In 
1988, however, he was appointed as North Korean ambassador to 
Hungary, and resumed his overseas service. Following this, Kim 
Pyong-il was appointed as ambassador to Bulgaria in February 
1989. After staying in his home country for a while, he assumed 
the post of North Korean ambassador to Finland this March. 
  The fact that the eldest son of Kim Il-song's present wife 
is 
wandering from place to place as a diplomat clearly illustrates 
that Kim Pyong-il has been regarded as a "political rival" by 
Kim Chong-il. 
  It has been learned that even after Kim Pyong-il was sent 
overseas, Kim Chong-il mercilessly purged the figures showing 
intimacy and familiarity with Kim Pyong-il among his schoolmates 
and associates. 
  Ko Yong-hwan, a former North Korean diplomat who defected to 
the ROK some time ago, explains how Kim Pyong-il has been held 
in check by Kim Chong-il. 
  "On the day Kim Pyong-il arrived in Sofia as the North 
Korean 
ambassador to Bulgaria, the embassy's party secretary directed 
the staff to greet the ambassador at the airport. However, only 
two went to the airport, including the party secretary himself, 
among some 30 embassy staff members. This was because if one 
meets Kim Pyong-il, one must prepare a report in the form of a 
document noting how long and by whose directive one met with Kim 
Pyong-il, and the content of the conversation with him, and must 
forward the report to the State Security Department." 
  Since Kim Pyong-il has been treated harshly by Kim Chong-il, 
it is possible that he may commit any kind of unexpected act, 
and this report was aimed at collecting information regarding 
his activities and preventing him from committing an unexpected 
act. His recent summoning seems to have a similar purpose. 
  The other observation has been focused on the "indication of 
abnormality" within the North Korean power structure. 
  According to remarks of the people who recently visited 
North 
Korea, including Reverend Billy Graham who visited there last 
February, Kim Il-song is personally handling overall policies. 
As a result, "delicate relations" with Kim Chong-il have been 
created. 
  In particular, the return of Kim Yong-chu--Kim Il-song's 
brother--to power as vice president after 20 years, reflects to 
a certain degree that Kim Il-song feels somewhat uneasy in 
turning over his power to Kim Chong-il. 
  However, the dominant observation is that the view that Kim 
Pyong-il's recent movements are related to Kim Chong-il's 
succession to power is premature. 
  At any rate, a precise observation of the movements within 
the North Korean power structure surrounding Kim Pyong-il will 
be possible only after his return to Finland.
