<F P=106> [Editorial: "Why Does the Government Change Its North </F>
Korean Nuclear Policy again?"] 
  [Text] The government's North Korean nuclear policy is 
shaking once again. After meeting with the Chinese leaders, 
President Kim Yong-sam -- who promised in a meeting with 
Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa to "closely cooperate with 
Japan" to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue -- is moving in 
the direction of "resolving the nuclear issue through dialogue." 
This happened only five days after he visited China. 
  When President Kim Yong-sam left Seoul for China, it was the 
government's position that it would persuade China to stand with 
the other permanent member states of the UN Security Council to 
discuss sanctions against North Korea. According to the outcome 
of the ROK-PRC talks, however, President Kim was likely to be 
persuaded by President Jiang Zemin with China's logic that North 
Korea must not be aggravated. 
  Regarding the government's policy change, the government 
said 
that it would expect China -- as the only state that can 
persuade North Korea to accept the nuclear inspections -- to be 
a mediator in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  There may be some reasons for the government's change of 
policy, but what makes the people at home and abroad feel 
embarrassment regarding the issue is that its uncertain policy 
can cause harm to the country' reputation, as well as badly 
affecting its security system. This is why we worry over the 
government's uncertain policy. 
  We must, first, consider relations with the United States, 
as 
well as Japan with which we have cooperated in strengthening the 
joint effort to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. Now, 
the government may lose its credit in diplomatic circles because 
it has decided to delay all ongoing meetings regarding the UN 
Security Council's sanctions against North Korea. Even the 
United States has denounced the government's unfixed nuclear 
policy toward North Korea. 
  In addition to this, Hwang Pyong-tae, ROK ambassador to 
China, said that "we would discuss the issue with the United 
States, as well as with China," and that "we would even work 
together with China to resolve it." We cannot but be stunned by 
his remarks. These remarks indicate that the government will 
introduce China's active participation in the settlement of the 
North Korean nuclear issue. Up to now, the United States, South 
Korea, and North Korea have mainly made efforts to resolve the 
issue. Also, this can cause confusion in our country's security 
system, as well as in the basic direction of our diplomacy, 
which we have so far carried out centering on the United States 
and Japan. 
  We wonder how the ambassador -- even though he is neither 
the 
relevant official in charge of policy affairs nor the 
responsible official in charge of diplomatic affairs -- could 
make such remarks at an ambassador-level position. This 
indicates that there are some problems in the diplomatic 
organization. 
  The present international trends around the Korean peninsula 
regarding the North Korean nuclear issue look like the ones in 
which the great powers struggled against each other in the late 
period of the Yi Dynasty. There are even signs regarding these 
trends. China has already pressured the ROK Government 
regarding ROK policy under the pretext of its influence over 
North Korea. Recently, Russia, which had so far remained silent 
regarding the North Korean nuclear issue, proposed to hold an 
eight-party international conference. Even an organ published by 
the National Defense Ministry reported that Russia should take 
the lead in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. On the 
other hand, the Russian deputy foreign minister suddenly said 
that the treaty on friendship and cooperation between Russia and 
North Korea, a military treaty, can be initiated [paltong] when 
North Korea is invaded. 
  This means that all great powers concerned with Korea will 
competitively participate in the Korean peninsula issue. A 
century ago, we already had a bitter experience with these kinds 
of struggles conducted by the great powers regarding the Korean 
peninsula. The country's main pillar must not be shaken because 
of a diplomatic issue such as the North Korean nuclear issue.
