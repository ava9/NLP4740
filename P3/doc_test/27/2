In the interests of safety an ordinary motorway contra-flow requires about
10,000 road cones. In view of the number of roads currently under repair
this means there are probably more than 3m cones in use in Britain alone.
'By the year 2000,' the Highways Agency forecasts, '37 per cent of Britain's
motorway network could be operating above its design capacity.' In other
words, over a third of its main roads will be either blocked with cars or
coned off for repair. We are moving into the era of King Cone.
In the Gloucestershire hamlet of Broughton Poggs this news is cause for
optimism. Broughton Poggs is the home of Peter Cook Safety Products, the
world's leading producer of cones - every week they make 25,000 of them.
David Morgan, the company's managing director and inventor of the plastic
cone even collects them. He has 570 in his garage.
Morgan produced the first PVC cone in 1967 while he was working at ICI and
experimenting with liquid polythene.
'It was my job to make products using a rotating moulding machine. I tried
designing hollow toys - one was an elephant but when I pulled it out of the
mould the trunk kept breaking off. I drove over a wooden police cone going
to work one day and realised it was the perfect shape for my machine.'
In 1973 he was invited to set up a cone manufacturing plant for British
Telecom and he has been making and collecting them ever since.
Morgan was runner-up in a recent British television vote for the most boring
man in Britain (the winner collected brown paper bags). But how could anyone
want to surround himself with objects that symbolise danger and
frustra-tion?
'For me road cones hold an extraordinary fascination, and I can spot a
different design at 100 yards,' he says. 'I search for different styles
everywhere I travel, and then barter for new discoveries with swaps in my
boot.'
The prizes in his collection include a five-sided cone he picked up in
Manchester, a Malaysian version he found on a beach in the Scilly Isles, and
one from his own company which floated ashore while he was on holiday in
Corsica.
'I took it through the red channel at Heathrow customs but the man said: 'We
haven't got a category for that. OK, carry on.''
The adaptability of these coloured plastic sentries is immense. They turn up
guarding wet paint or washed floors in public buildings, on football
training grounds or at cycling proficiency test centres, as accessories in
student bedsits, and as chewable toys for young pit bull terriers. Morgan
spotted one suspended over a naked bulb outside a brothel in Amsterdam.
And he recently received a video from a zoo-keeper of a polar bear playing
with one - swimming with it and storing his food in it.
'Watch News at Ten every day and there'll always be one of mine somewhere,'
he says.
They possess great authority. Motorists manoeuvre obediently around them
even when they have strayed from their original position. The key is to keep
them upright - a horizontal cone is usually ignored - and for this reason a
legion of workers pour 20 tons of sand a day into the black-plastic base.
Morgan has done well from the cones. He runs a highly successful 24-hour
manufacturing business with a Pounds 9m turnover.
Britain, with the best road safety record in the world, has persuaded other
countries to invest in cones and 20 per cent of their sales are overseas,
mostly to mainland Europe. But Morgan sells cones to police forces and
traffic authorities as far away as Saudi Arabia and China, as well as large
and engineering companies across the UK. 'We get orders from all over the
world,' says Morgan. 'One of ours was pulled out of the sea by a man in Fiji
and he requested 5,000.'
Morgan's company makes everything from the diminutive 13-inch traffic cone
to the giant Highwayman. Personalised wedding cones decorated with lace and
frills are available to order and Morgan sells about 50 special black
funeral cones a week. He has even diversified into road signs, barrier
systems, flashing lamps and paint for marking out white and yellow lines.
But the production of around 1.5m cones a year is still the chief
pre-occupation of the 65 staff at the Broughton Poggs plant.
In Britain, the 365-page Traffic Sign Regulation and General Directions
booklet gives precise dimensions and colours of cones, and the layout needed
for certain types of traffic control.
Cones are forever getting stolen, mangled or discoloured, so there is always
fresh demand.
Is Morgan proud of his job?
'Well it's not something I admit to socially, but it's quite satisfying
knowing my product sees people through road works safely.'
What if there is a decline in road building?
'That's fine - old worn out roads are better for us. But if and when work
starts on extending the M25 to 14 lanes, we're going to have a big party.'
