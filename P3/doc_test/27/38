Poway's attempt to force neighboring San Diego to reopen Pomerado Road to 
traffic between the two cities was detoured Friday, dashing Poway city leaders' 
hopes of giving their constituents an early Christmas present -- the easing of 
ever-increasing traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Jeffery T. Miller ordered the North County community to 
present more evidence in its case against the city of San Diego. Poway contends 
that San Diego has no legal right to keep Pomerado Road blockaded now that a 
$3-million face lift has removed its hairpin turns and other traffic hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Miller set a Dec. 20 hearing for oral arguments by attorneys on both sides and 
ordered Poway City Atty. Stephen M. Eckis to submit further evidence on whether 
Pomerado Road is a major road, and whether it is specified as such in San 
Diego's general plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Based upon this issue, the city of Poway feels confident that the judge will 
order the reopening of Pomerado Road following the hearing of oral arguments on 
Dec. 20," John Fitch, Poway's assistant city manager, said. 
</P>
<P>
Fitch conceded that Poway officials were "somewhat disappointed" that the judge 
did not order San Diego to reopen Pomerado Road immediately but said he remains 
confident that the smaller city will prevail. 
</P>
<P>
The battle over the road, a popular shortcut that bypasses a 3-mile section of 
Interstate 15 that slows to a crawl during commuting hours, began more than two 
years ago when San Diego annexed several hundred acres of land north to the 
Poway city limits. 
</P>
<P>
Pomerado, which runs through the annexed area, was ordered closed after the 
annexation because the narrow, winding roadway was considered a safety hazard 
that did not meet city street standards. 
</P>
<P>
Last month -- after the San Diego City Council had voted to reopen the newly 
contructed road, then reversed itself -- Poway sued San Diego, contending that 
the bigger city was violating state motor vehicle codes by blockading a 
traveled regional route. Local governments may close major roads temporarily 
for repairs or other safety regions, Poway argued, but cannot keep the roads 
closed after the safety hazards are removed. 
</P>
<P>
Les Girard, San Diego deputy city attorney, said Poway's attorney "is painting 
the issue all black or white." 
</P>
<P>
State laws allow a city to take such actions as closing a major road if certain 
specific actions are taken, Girard said, "and we took those actions in 1988, by 
amending the Scripps Miramar North community plan to provide that Pomerado Road 
would remain closed until another major road was completed" that linked Poway 
with Interstate 15 and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Poway's problem is that they did not challenge the action at that time," 
Girard said, "and now it is too late."
