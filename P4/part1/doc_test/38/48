Ole Christian Furuseth of Norway broke from a tightly bunched pack after the 
first run to win the slalom portion of the men's combined competition by 
one-hundredth of a second today at the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
The combined slalom results will be paired with a downhill on Friday to 
determine the combined medalists. 
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg's Marc Girardelli, who placed third in the combined slalom, loomed 
as the clear-cut favorite for the gold medal because of his downhill prowess. 
</P>
<P>
Furuseth, 22, whose best World Cup result was a second in a giant slalom this 
season, came from sixth place after the first run to edge Sweden's Jonas 
Nilsson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fierce Competition 
</P>
<P>
The top seven racers in the first run were separated by a mere 
nineteen-hundredths of a second, setting up fierce competition in the second 
heat. Veteran Paul Frommelt of Liechtenstein led the way in the first run at 
49.96 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Furuseth was clocked in 46.77 seconds for the quickest second run over a 
slightly shorter, 57-gate course. Nilsson, in fifth place, had a 46.82 in the 
second run. 
</P>
<P>
That left Furuseth with an aggregate time of 1 minute, 36.89 seconds, while 
Nilsson finished at 1:36.90. 
</P>
<P>
Girardelli finished third in 1:37.65, followed by Tetsuya Okabe of Japan in 
1:37.66 and Frommelt in 1:37.83. Switzerland's Paul Accola was sixth in 
1:37.85. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Californian Places 12th 
</P>
<P>
Austria's Guenther Mader, another expected contender in the combined, was ninth 
in 1:38.14, and Switzerland's Pirmin Zurbriggen stood 11th in 1:38.47. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Ormsby of Tahoe City, Calif., was 12th in 1:38.63. 
</P>
<P>
Felix McGrath of Shelburne, Vt., who was 12th in the first heat, missed a gate 
halfway down the course. Tiger Shaw of Stowe, Vt., straddled a gate and did not 
finish the first run. 
</P>
<P>
Among other first-run casualties were Austria's Hubert Strolz, the combined 
gold medalist at the Calgary Olympics, and West Germany's Armin Bittner, who 
shares this season's World Cup slalom lead with Girardelli. Strolz straddled a 
gate just 19 seconds into his run, and Bittner missed a gate barely 10 seconds 
into his run. 
</P>
<P>
Austria's Bernhard Gstrein, who was seventh and just .19 seconds behind 
Frommelt entering the second run, straddled a gate about 10 seconds from the 
finish.
