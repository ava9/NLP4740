BOWMAN TO BRING TALENT HOME FOR PICKWICK SHOWS; 
</P>
<P>
FIGURE SKATING: FORMER NATIONAL CHAMPION FROM VAN NUYS TO PERFORM IN BENEFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christopher Bowman and Todd Eldredge, winners of the past two U. S. national 
men's figure skating championships, are expected to participate in 
"Icetraveganza," a benefit show produced by the Los Angeles Figure Skating 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, Eldredge and several other of the club's international competitors will 
perform in shows Saturday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. at the Pickwick Ice Arena in 
Burbank. There will be no scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, 23, will be returning to his old stomping grounds. He grew up in Van 
Nuys and trained with Coach Frank Carroll at Pickwick until last year when 
Carroll opened his own Ice Castles International Training Center near Lake 
Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
Eldredge, 19, originally from Massachusetts, now trains in San Diego with Coach 
Richard Callaghan. Eldredge was the surprise winner of this year's national 
championships in Salt Lake City. Bowman, who was bothered by a back injury, 
placed fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Both skaters competed in August at the Goodwill Games in Seattle. Eldredge, 
coming off a fifth-place finish in the World Championships, placed third in the 
Goodwill Games behind world champion Kurt Browning of Canada and Viktor 
Petrenko of the Soviet Union. Bowman, who appeared out of shape, was sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Sand and Natasha Kuchiki, the nation's top pairs team, also will perform. 
Sand, 26, from Thousand Oaks, and Kuchiki, 13, from Canoga Park, were second at 
the U.S. championships behind Kristi Yamaguchi and Rudi Galindo. However, the 
gold medal-winning team split up to pursue singles careers soon after. 
</P>
<P>
Kuchiki's former partner, Richard Alexander, 21, from Simi Valley, will skate 
with his new partner, Tristen Vega, 16, from Torrance. Alexander and Vega 
joined forces a year ago and won the U.S. Juniors title only four months later. 
</P>
<P>
Other top names who will be appearing in the show include 1984 Olympian Tiffany 
Chin, 1988 Olympic bronze medalist Peter Oppegard and the Olympic Festival gold 
medal ice dancing team of Jeanne Miley and Michael Verlich. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds go to the club's Olympic and world competition fund with a portion 
donated to the fight against cerebral palsy.
