LONG ARM OF LAW TO FLEX ITS MUSCLE IN POLICE GAMES

Thugs, take note. Next week is not the time to knock over that Oxnard Boulevard 
convenience store or that A Street bank you've been eyeing. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Sunday, about 5,200 police officers from throughout the state will 
converge on Oxnard for the annual California Police Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The six-day event is expected to attract representatives from about 400 
departments spanning most levels of law enforcement -- from city police 
officers and county sheriff's deputies to members of the U.S. Border Patrol and 
federal marshals. Even state lottery investigators are expected to compete. 
</P>
<P>
"Oxnard is going to be a very safe place," said patrol officer patrol officer 
Lee Wilco, co-chairman of the Oxnard Police Department's organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
It also will be crowded. City officials expect 50,000 spectators -- most of 
them from out of town -- to gather to watch the long arm of the law flex its 
muscle in 45 competitive events, including arm-wrestling, boxing and 
bodybuilding. 
</P>
<P>
The throngs attracted by the games are expected to pump $5 million into Oxnard 
and four other Ventura County cities where events will be held and contestants 
will hang their hats. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few other times the county has seen a convention on this order, city 
officials say, was when Oxnard was host for the 1985 Police Olympics, billed as 
the second-largest sporting event after the international Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels were so packed, Wilcox said, that he had to put up two competitors at 
his home. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the week's festive atmosphere, competing officers still must go by 
the book. They can be disqualified, fined or even put on probation for 
roughhousing, cheating or even swearing. Judges can call for a hearing on the 
smallest infraction. A judge once yanked a gold medal from a foulmouthed power 
lifter on his way out of the ring. 
</P>
<P>
"John McEnroe wouldn't even get past the judges," said Bob Burke, a member of 
the board of directors of the California Police Athletic Federation, which 
oversees the games. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incentive to Officers 
</P>
<P>
Unseemly behavior, organizers say, would defeat the purpose of the games, which 
were founded in 1967 as an incentive for police officers to keep in shape but 
have continued as a means of generating good will. 
</P>
<P>
"These are mainly people who get in the paper for shooting someone," Burke 
said. "We want to show them in a positive light." 
</P>
<P>
As in the conventional Olympics, the top three competitors in each category win 
gold, silver or bronze medals. But in the police version, competitors who place 
fourth and fifth also take home medals -- and the thrill of victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts so good," said Jim Struck, an Oxnard police officer who last year won 
gold medals in the light-heavyweight boxing and karate divisions. To make sure 
he gets to repeat the experience, Struck said he has been working out two hours 
daily on a punching bag and in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
Other competitors have been as earnest. Take Sgt. Easie Williams, a Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department detective who coaches the largest boxing team in 
the competition. He has been pitting his 10 charges against each other in 12 to 
15 rounds a week -- that on top of a running regime of two to three miles 
daily, plus weightlifting. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys aren't fooling around," Wilcox said. "It's fierce competition." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
World-Class Athletes 
</P>
<P>
In fact, some competitors such as George Lopez, who will box in the 156-pound 
weight class Wednesday and Friday, are world-class athletes. 
</P>
<P>
A 29-year-old community relations officer for the Los Angeles Police 
Department, Lopez fought for Argentina in the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, where he 
was defeated by Ray Downey, the Canadian boxer who went on to win a bronze 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a good, crisp jab," said Larry Moore, who coaches Lopez as the Police 
Department's athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Competitors will begin arriving Sunday, although the action does not begin 
until 8 a.m. the next day, with the triathlon through Oxnard State Beach behind 
the Embassy Suites Hotel, headquarters for the games. Admission to all events 
is free. 
</P>
<P>
The competitive roster includes such Olympian staples as tennis, rowing, track 
and field, and equestrian events. Many contests, however, are tailored to the 
talents of police officers -- arm-wrestling, pistol shooting and contests with 
police dogs. Such events as surfing, water-skiing and scuba highlight the 
"California" in the competition's name. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers expect the boxing matches, which begin at 7 p.m. Monday, Wednesday 
and Friday in the Oxnard Civic Auditorium, to attract the widest following. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boxing Fans 
</P>
<P>
On one night alone in 1985, boxing attracted more than 2,000 fans, the 
auditorium's capacity. To catch any overflow this year, organizers plan to pipe 
fights via cable television into two adjacent conference rooms. 
</P>
<P>
It is that sort of attention to detail that won Oxnard the 1989 bid over two 
other cities. Organizers said they were impressed by the welcome they received 
in 1985. At the time, Oxnard was the smallest city to have hosted the 
California games. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually you don't get that much community support," said Duke Nyhus, the 
founder of the games and the executive director of the California Police 
Athletics Federation. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Oxnard will go down in history as home to the last California Police 
Olympics. In an attempt to avoid a dispute with the International Olympic 
Committee, which has sought to enjoin police organizations in other states from 
referring to their games as "Olympics," the California Police Athletics 
Federation plans to change the name of the event to the California Police 
Summer Games beginning in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lengthy Planning 
</P>
<P>
But Oxnard's role has not come without sacrifice. The Oxnard Police Department 
has already invested three years in planning the games. Since September, Wilcox 
and another officer have been relieved of regular duties to devote themselves 
full time to organizing the games. 
</P>
<P>
The event is expected to cost the city $350,000, which it hopes to recoup 
through entrance fees for participants, although some cities have not been so 
successful. Newport Beach, for instance, lost money when it was the host for 
the games in 1986, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
While many existing facilities were suited to particular events, such as the 
L.A. Raiders training field where daily soccer games will be held, others had 
to be jury-rigged. Organizers, aided by Santa Paula Honda Automobiles, had to 
build a race track on the future site of a housing development at Gonzales Road 
and Oxnard Boulevard for motocross events Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Some streets will be closed next Thursday and Friday to make way for a 
decathlon and a 50-mile bike ride. What's more, organizers plan to tap the 
services of more than 500 volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tremendous undertaking," said Mayor Nao Takasugi, "but it brings 
recognition to the city of Oxnard and gives it an economic boost, and builds 
police morale."
