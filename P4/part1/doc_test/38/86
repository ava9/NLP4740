HOWITZER shells and dynamite exploded outside my hotel before dawn, rattling
the windows and, in the darkness, conjuring up images of some war-torn
trouble spot. But this was neither Bosnia nor Beirut, but the 'Bird'. And
the enemy was snow: too much of it for comfort, but enough to make skiers
ecstatic. Downstairs in the lobby of the huge, futuristic Cliff Lodge Hotel
in Snowbird, Utah, was a sign with big red lettering reading: 'Danger of
avalanches. It is illegal to leave the building'.
Much to the delight of skiers on both sides of the Atlantic, December has
turned out to be a vintage month for snow. Skiers were knee-deep in fresh
powder during the traditional curtain-raiser to the season in Val d'Isere,
the criterium de la premiere neige. Austria has had one of the best starts
to the season for years, with good snow everywhere, to depths of 3.5 metres.
Marion Telsnig at the Austrian Tourist Office says some skiers are already
reporting the best skiing they have ever experienced. The Swiss are also
confident of a good season but in Italy, the snow is a little patchy and so
far no one is using superlatives.
In California, where there is officially a drought, an unprecedented 38
inches of snow fell in a day in Kirkwood, south of Lake Tahoe. So much snow
fell in Snowbird and neighbouring Alta that the road through Little
Cottonwood Canyon down to Salt Lake City - notorious for avalanches - was
closed all night until it was made safe by blasting.
On the mountain, supplies of second world war shells for avalanche control
are running low, so the resort is now using shells left over from the Korean
war at Dollars 100 a go, and working on a new system using compressed air
which will cost only Dollars 10 a blast.
Even in Colorado, somewhat jealous of the major early snowstorms hitting
California, Utah and even Vermont, snow was falling steadily during the
party to celebrate the opening night (at last) of the town's biggest and
most controversial hotel, the Ritz Carlton. A layer of fresh powder formed
on the 12-ft tall bronze statue of a bull elk standing guard outside -
nicknamed 'Fritzy' - which was officially unveiled before the celebrations
began.
Dawn revealed an Aspen mountain full of powder and few skiers, celebrities
or otherwise, to take advantage of it. We were able to help ourselves to run
after run, unhindered by the madding crowd, making fresh tracks almost at
will.
There is even enough snow left in New Zealand to enable skiing to continue
here and there until Christmas. Many resorts in Europe and America are
assured not only of a white Christmas but one of the best for skiing in
years.
The lure of the Rockies continues to entice some Europeans away from their
own backyard. For a group of Belgian, German and Dutch ski club executives,
the first taste of skiing this winter was in Colorado, where two more
Europeans - Franz Klammer and Franz Weber - were holding a ski clinic in
Copper Mountain.
Weber, six times world speed skiing champion in the '80s, now lives in Reno.
His fellow Austrian Klammer - the darling of Innsbruck and Kitzbuhel - is a
regular visitor to Colorado. For those of us attending the clinic, it was
fantasy time. The man skiing at more than 50 miles per hour in front of us
down a trail called Oh No] - whom I was trying to keep in my sights like a
Spitfire pilot on the tail of a Messerschmidt - is the most successful
downhill racer of all time. I had waited for this moment since 1976, when
the most celebrated of his 25 downhill victories at Igls in the Innsbruck
Olympics astonished the skiing world.
Right now, Klammer seemed to be trying to relive the experience, although he
was putting in a few turns. Any other skier in any other resort would
probably have had his lift pass taken away. 'Did you do as many turns as I
did?' he asks at the bottom of the mountain.
'No Franz,' I replied wimpishly. 'Why not?' 'Because you are almost 10 years
younger than me.' 'No excuses]' he says. Now approaching 40, Klammer looks
as good as ever. He and Weber are helping us with race techniques.
'Even if you win, you should never be satisfied,' says Klammer. 'You should
always want to have skied it faster. You should say to yourself: 'Dammit,
that wasn't good enough.' Don't slide so much. You must carve your turns
more. When you have crossed the fall line, you should be able to see your
tracks behind you. If there are no tracks, your skis are sliding too much.'
Klammer still races against other former champions. Recently, he was
fighting it out in Utah against the likes of Bill Johnston (whom he called
'nose-picker' when he won the Olympic gold medal in Sarajevo in 1984.)
'Of course, I try to keep in touch with new skiing trends as I get older,'
he says. 'But you know, skiing has not changed fundamentally since I learnt
to ski with leather boots, cable bindings and no edges. When I was a boy,
only racers had edges. But even today, you still have to stay on the middle
of your skis.
'In the old days, it was more difficult. Soft leather boots didn't support
you and you had to find your own middle. Nowadays the boot does it for you,
and today's skis are built to turn on their own, once you apply pressure to
your edges. That's why you get more knee injuries than you used to. If for
some reason the ski failed to turn, the weakest part of your body will turn
instead - your knees]' And with that he was off, steaming down the mountain
as if his knees were bionic. Klammer will be home for Christmas. Colorado
powder or not, he plans to enjoy some of the local variety in his native
Carinthia.
