John W. Kluge, last month named the wealthiest man in the United States by 
Forbes magazine, surveyed the Arcadia ballroom of Loew's Santa Monica Beach 
hotel, where 700 current and former Ice Capades performers, crew, creative 
staff and executives had gathered for the venerable ice show's 50th anniversary 
gala reunion on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
They were almost all there, hundreds of past and present stars of the ice. 
Missing was Peggy Fleming, the 1968 Olympic gold medalist in women's figure 
skating, who sent her regrets after the Northern California earthquake. Robin 
Cousins, the 1980 Olympic men's figure skating champion, told the crowd he'd 
talked with Fleming and she said, "I'd love to be there, but my house is in 
eight different parts of San Jose right now." 
</P>
<P>
Kluge, chairman of Metromedia Co., owned Ice Capades for 23 years, selling the 
show in 1986 to Thomas K. Scallen, while remaining a partner. He and Metromedia 
executive vice president Stuart Subotnick flew in from Charlottesville for the 
evening, joining celebrants from throughout the United States and Canada as 
well as Europe, Australia and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"We sold the show but we never left the people," Kluge said. "They are what Ice 
Capades is all about -- it's the huge family." 
</P>
<P>
The "family" reunion began with a cocktail party Saturday evening at Pomodoro, 
continued Sunday with attendance of an Ice Capades performance at the Forum 
starring 1988 Olympic women's figure skating silver medalist Elizabeth Manley 
and pair-skating silver medalists Natalie and Wayne Seybold, and culminated 
with the post-show bash at Loew's. 
</P>
<P>
At cocktail time at the hotel's atrium lobby, Cousins marveled, "I just met the 
man who's the reason I skate. I saw Nicky Powers playing the prince in a 
production of 'Sleeping Beauty' on ice in 1967 and said 'I love skating, I have 
to skate.' " 
</P>
<P>
The musings and recollections continued over dinner: warm salmon mousse in 
lobster sauce, salad, sauteed breast of chicken with morels in mustard sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 Olympic champion in men's figure skating, Scott Hamilton, and silver 
medalist Peter Carruthers reminisced about the winter games. Ken Shelley, 1972 
U.S. champion and Olympic contender in men's and pair skating, told former 
chorus skater Linda Illsley Simons about the all-star skating AIDS benefit to 
be held Monday at New York City's 26th Street Armory. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton and Cousins emceed the program. Besides Kluge, speakers included 
Scallen and George and Denise Eby -- he a former Ice Capades chairman and she a 
member of the first company. Receiving cheers and applause were such former 
favorites as Donna Atwood, Bobby Specht, Bob Paul and Barbara Wagner, Sonya 
Dunfield, Norah and Michael Kirby, Robin Lee, Aja Zanova, and Tim Wood; ice 
clowns Freddie Trenkler and Terry Head; and the oldest attendee, 92-year-old 
Irma Thomas, an early Ice Capades star. 
</P>
<P>
The evening officially ended with a film of Ice Capades highlights. But 
numerous people lingered to chat, reluctant to leave after waiting so long to 
find each other again.
