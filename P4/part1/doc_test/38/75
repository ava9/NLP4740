 -- They can not, by any stretch of the imagination, be considered typical 
spectator sports. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, very few Southern California high schools give out varsity 
letters in field hockey, team handball, canoeing or kayaking. 
</P>
<P>
It is only at the national and international levels that these very low-profile 
activities manage to gain a measure of recognition. 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. Olympic Festival, which began last Saturday and concludes Sunday, is 
an event which provides such an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
And the 38 Ventura County athletes participating in the three sports are taking 
full advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's field hockey competition, exactly half of the 50 participants 
split among the four regional teams list Ventura County cities as their 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
A first-round game between the West and the South last Sunday resembled a 
Conejo Valley all-star scrimmage. Of the 30 players taking part in the game, 24 
were from the East end of Ventura County, former home of the sport's national 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately enough, the game ended in a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Ruvalcaba of Thousand Oaks scored the South's only goal 7:55 into the 
game. The West's scoring came from Ventura's Benjamin Maruquin, whose goal came 
with four minutes left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
The South missed a chance to go ahead on a penalty attempt when John O'Neill of 
Newbury Park kicked a shot over the top of the goal with seven minutes left in 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
A Festival single-session record crowd of 1,084 watched goalkeeper Tom Vano of 
Simi Valley secure five saves for the West. 
</P>
<P>
After two games, the South and West are both undefeated. On Monday, the South 
got four goals from County players in a 5-2 decision over the North. Meanwhile, 
Vano accounted for six more saves as the West tied again, 2-2, in a match 
against the East. 
</P>
<P>
The medal games will be played Friday night at Cameron Stadium in Lawton, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
In team handball, members of the Condors, a Ventura club, have accounted 39 of 
the 58 goals scored by the West as it won two of its first three games. 
</P>
<P>
Denny Fercho of Camarillo scored five times in a 17-16 decision over the North 
on Saturday, then followed it up with four goals in a 27-21 loss to the East on 
Sunday. He had three more in a 20-17 win over the South on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Against the East, Kevin Withrow of Thousand Oaks led all scorers with seven 
goals. He added four more against the South. 
</P>
<P>
Monday was Jeff Fruin's turn to lead the team in scoring. Fruin, of Camarillo, 
made a game-high six goals, including four in the last 12 minutes of the first 
half as the West fought back from an early deficit. 
</P>
<P>
A family team brought the County its first gold medal of the Festival on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Buena High graduates Fred and David Spaulding won the two-man canoe 1,000-meter 
race at Lake Overholser with a time of 3:55.87. Earlier in the day, Fred won a 
silver in the individual 1,000-meter race with a time of 4:17.74. David took 
the bronze in 4:21.83. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Spauldings combined efforts again in the 500-meter doubles 
event, but this time had to settle for silver. Fred won another silver in the 
500-meter singles race with a time of 2:01.98. David was fourth in 2:05.64 and 
Jim Harper of Ventura was sixth. 
</P>
<P>
In all, there are 50 County athletes and coaches participating in the Festival. 
Among the other top local performers are figure skater Tisha Walker and men's 
basketball player Don MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, a 5-1, 101-pound 15-year old from Thousand Oaks, was fifth in women's 
figure skating. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean, a UCLA sophomore from Simi Valley, scored 31 points in three games for 
the West team. 
</P>

EIGHT IS ENOUGH

Festival are selected to the U. S. team in the Junior World Cup. Page 14.
