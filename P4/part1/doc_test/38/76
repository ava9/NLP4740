Thunderstorms played havoc with outdoor events Sunday at the U.S. Olympic 
Festival, turning the spotlight indoors, where Olympic champion wrestlers Kenny 
Monday and Dave Schultz battled just to get into the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, the 1988 Olympic gold medalist from Stillwater, Okla., earned a 6-3 
victory over Schultz, 1984 Olympic gold medalist, which led to Schultz's 
elimination from the 163.5-pound freestyle wrestling mini-tournament. Monday 
won two more matches in the evening to advance. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be a little closer," said Monday, who wrestled at Oklahoma 
State. "I thought I was in control, but I never thought I had the match won. In 
freestyle, you can't afford to give up, especially with a guy like Dave 
Schultz. You never know what he's going to pull." 
</P>
<P>
Schultz, who coached the national team before deciding to return to 
competition, couldn't pull out anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrestled real poor, real poor," he said. "I've got nothing good to say about 
the way I wrestled." 
</P>
<P>
The mini-tournament at 163.5 was loaded with former champions, including the 
two Olympic gold medalists and five National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
Monday defeated David Lee, the NCAA champion this year from Wisconsin, and 
Eddie Urbano, a former NCAA title winner from Arizona State, exchanging words 
with Urbano after the 6-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
At 125.5 pounds, identical twins Tony and Nick Purler of Wentzville, Mo., 
refused to wrestle each other, keeping a pact they made in the eighth grade. 
Because Tony won on injury default -- although no injury exists -- Nick also 
could continue to compete in the mini-tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I petitioned in at 125 and he petitioned in at 114 but was unable to make 
weight," Tony said. "We drew each other. That's never happened before in a 
blind draw. It's only right that he should default. 
</P>
<P>
"It stinks that that had to happen, but he didn't make weight." 
</P>
<P>
In the boxing semifinals, three of four U.S. amateur titlists advanced. But 
super heavyweight Larry Donald of Cincinnati won a unanimous decision over 
national champion Eddie Donerlson Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Donald, a shoe salesman who began boxing only two years ago, predicted a gold 
medal was in his future. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to see some big things come Tuesday night (against Kelvin 
Richardson)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The amateur champions who won were four-time national titlist Brian Lonon at 
112 pounds; Frank Pena at 125 pounds; and Chris Byrd at 156 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
In afternoon basketball, the East women remained unbeaten with a 66-61 victory 
over the West as Valeria Whiting of Stanford had 10 points and 10 rebounds. The 
teams combined for 48 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times when you say it's a shame that anyone had to lose a ballgame. 
Today was one that it's a shame anyone had to win," East Coach Chris Gobrecht 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The East men beat the West,94-87,in overtime. Todd Day of Arkansas scored 16 
points, including five in overtime.
