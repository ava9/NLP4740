the United Democratic Front, UDF, in some parts of Blantyre, 
following's UDF's election victory. A statement by Aford 
Organizing Secretary [name indistinct] said the incidents 
happened in [words indistinct] and that they have been reported 
to the police. He appealed to UDF supporters to [words 
indistinct]. 
  In Karonga, the president of the Alliance for Democracy, 
Aford, Mr. Chakufwa Chihana, has called on his supporters in the 
district to refrain from any violence. Speaking when he 
addressed his supporters to brief them on election results, Mr. 
Chihana said the fact that they have lost the election should be 
no (?guarantee) to quarrel with members of other parties, 
especially the UDF. He said in the new Malawi there is need to 
live together. 
  Mr. Chihana also told the people that he is due to hold 
discussions with the state president on the issue of running the 
government.
