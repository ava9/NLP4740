  [Text] Some mystery is surrounding the negotiations that 
have been going on between Malawi's new UDF [United Democratic 
Front] government of President Bakili Muluzi and their allies in 
opposition, Aford [Alliance for Democracy], led by Chakufwa 
Chihana. Certainly, they were startling. Aford which gained 36 
seats against the UDF's 84, was apparently unhappy with the 
junior ministries it was offered. Yesterday, there were 
conflicting reports that the talks had broken down or were still 
on. There have also been suggestions that Aford is now talking 
to the former ruling party, Hastings Banda's MCP [Malawi 
Congress Party]. On the line to Blantyre, Mary Harper asked 
Nick Young of the London FINANCIAL TIMES exactly what the 
position was. 
  [Begin recording] [Young] Well, if I can begin by saying 
that 
at the moment, President Muluzi is out of the country. He left 
behind the secretary general of the party, Harry Thompson, to 
conduct the talks with Aford. I understand that they have 
stalled rather than broken down and I don't personally believe 
there will be any development until Muluzi returns to have a 
personal input into what is on offer. The position, as I 
understand it, is that the UDF government has offered Aford the 
possibility of having three seats in cabinet, fairly minor 
posts. I am told, I don't know if this correct, but I am told 
that offer has now been cut to three minor posts plus a couple 
of deputy ministries. Now, my personal belief is that Aford or 
the leadership of Aford is divided over whether or not to take 
these posts. 
  [Harper] So, does it really look like there is a serious 
split in Aford? 
  [Young] Yes, I think there could well be, not necessarily a 
split into two camps, perhaps a split into several. 
  [Harper] And what about Mr. Chihana himself? 
  [Young] Mr. Chihana is keeping a very low profile. He is 
operating in negotiations through junior colleagues and he is a 
lot of the time incommunicado. He has remained in the north 
since the election result. He is going around making a series 
of public speeches, which he is doing apparently to calm 
people's feelings down up there because there are a lot of 
reports of strong secessionist demands coming from ordinary 
people -- people saying let us just break away and form our own 
country. He has been going around saying: No, we must respect 
the election result and federalism or being a separate country 
just isn't viable for the north. 
  [Harper] Now, we have had reports that since the stalling of 
the talks between Aford and the government, Aford has now turned 
to the former ruling MCP Party. Do you know anything about this? 
  [Young] Well, I certainly believe that they are talking to 
each and I think that is natural and understable. Exactly how 
the new Parliament is going to shape up, it is very far from 
clear and at the very least, one would expect all the parties to 
be sounding each other out. [end recording]
