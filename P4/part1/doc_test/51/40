  [Text] The president of the Alliance for Democracy, Aford, 
Mr. Chakufwa Chihana, has advised the people of the northern 
region to ignore regionalistic tendencies, despite differences 
in political thinking with other regions. Addressing a mass 
rally at [word indistinct] yesterday, Mr. Chihana stressed the 
need for unity in the country. He told the people that regional 
politics would not hold them together, adding that the northern 
region could not stand on its own, since the region had 
inadequate resources. Mr. Chihana also urged the people to give 
due respect to the state president, Mr. Bakili Muluzi, and his 
government. Mr. Chihana will tomorrow address a mass rally at 
Mzuzu Stadium from three o'clock in the afternoon.
