  [Text] Tomorrow, 17 May, Malawians will vote in the first 
multiparty parliamentary and presidential elections. In a press 
release issued in Lilongwe, the Electoral Commission called on 
all eligible voters to exercise their democratic right by voting 
in large numbers for the candidates of their choice. The voting 
will start at 0600 in the morning. Meanwhile, the commission 
has again strongly refuted rumors that members of the Malawi 
Army have already voted, emphasizing that all eligible voters 
and members of the Malawi Army will vote tomorrow.
