  [Text] The new UDF [United Democratic Front] government in 
Malawi is already beginning to delve into the dealings of 
ex-President Banda, who was defeated in the multiparty elections 
last month. As always, when leaders fall, it is amazing what 
scandals their successors can find to discredit them with. From 
Blantyre, Willy Zingani telexed this report: 
  The rope is getting tighter and tighter around Dr. Banda's 
neck. The new UDF government is trying to discover whether the 
ex-president abused his position to enrich himself. One thing 
they claim to have discovered is that Dr. Banda received rent 
from 11 state houses which didn't belong to him. The new 
minister of information and broadcasting, Brown Mpinganjira, 
says he has documents proving that 2.5 million pounds was paid 
in recent years to Dr. Banda as rent for houses belonging to the 
state. 
  The new state president, Bakili Muluzi, hasn't commented on 
the matter. It is, therefore, not known whether Dr. Banda will 
be asked to pay back the money or be taken to court to answer 
charges. Since Dr. Banda's defeat in 17th May general election, 
Malawians have been shocked by the news that he had spent 8 
million pounds on a new state house in the Malawi capital, 
Lilongwe. Earlier this week, for the first time, journalists 
were allowed to enter the palaces to see how Dr. Banda lived. 
In one room, there were six telephone lines, and all rooms, 
including the garage, were air conditioned.
