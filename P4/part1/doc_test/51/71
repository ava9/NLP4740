  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 21 SAPA -- Malawi's President 
Kamuzu Banda is reported to be critically ill, possibly from 
complications following brain surgery in South Africa late last 
year. Official government spokesmen could not be reached for 
comment on a report carried in an independent newspaper in 
Blantyre. 
  The NEW EXPRESS said a group of women scheduled to meet with 
Dr. Banda had been prevented from seeing the president when they 
arrived at the presidential Sanjika Palace last week. The 
newspaper quoted members of the delegation as saying they had 
been barred from meeting the president because he was in poor 
health. 
  The National Consultative Council, which also sought a 
meeting with the Malawi leader, also failed to secure an 
appointment. 
  A Western diplomat reached for comment by telephone from 
Johannesburg said rumours had been circulating the country about 
Dr Banda's illness, but he added he could not confirm the news 
report. 
  In an apparent bid to scotch the reports, Health and Foreign 
Minister Heatherwick Ntaba last week told the official media the 
president was in good health. 
  Dr Banda, believed to be in his 90s, underwent surgey to 
remove excess fluid from his brain last October. After a break 
during which the Presidential Council ran the country, he 
resumed leadership, but he appointed new ministers to control 
several ministries that had been in his hands for about three 
decades.
