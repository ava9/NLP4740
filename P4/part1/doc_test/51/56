<F P=106> [Telephone interview with South African Ambassador in </F>
Malawi, Llewellyn Crewe-Brown, by announcer John Bishop; date 
not given, from the "Agenda" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Bishop] A short time ago we made telephonic contact 
with South Africa's Ambassador to Malawi, Mr. Llewellyn 
Crewe-Brown, and I first asked him how the day had been so far. 
  [Crewe-Brown] It has been a very busy day, but a very 
interesting day in the history of Malawi. 
  [Bishop] More than ambassador today, I believe you are 
assisting in some way with the election? 
  [Crewe-Brown] Today I'm also an international observer. The 
Malawi Government asked for international observers to come to 
Malawi, and with a number of countries present, some of the 
embassy staff people are also acting as international observers, 
and I'm one of them. 
  [Bishop] What has been your observation so far? 
  [Crewe-Brown] I've been out in the rural areas of Lilongwe 
and it's been very clear that the elections are being held under 
strict supervision of the local parties, and I could say really 
so far, they have been free and fair. I've been very impressed 
with the quality of the elections so far. 
  [Bishop] Violence free? No violence? 
  [Crewe-Brown] It's been exceptionally violence free, both 
before the elections and on election day. We are very grateful 
for that. I think the Malawian Government was worried about 
this problem, but it certainly hasn't raised its head anywhere 
here in Malawi. 
  [Bishop] Now analysts are saying that it looks as if it's 
the 
end of the Hastings Banda era. Would you stick your neck out 
and comment? 
  [Crewe-Brown] Well, of course it's very difficult at this 
stage to say, but I think anyone has a chance, but I think that 
speculation here is that the United Democratic Front, under the 
leadership of Mr. Bikili Maluzi, has a very good chance of 
winning these elections. I personally think it's going to be 
quite a close a race between the Malawi Congress Party and the 
United Democratic Front, with the AFORD [Alliance for Democracy] 
Party in the third place. 
  [Bishop] If you had to prepare a report for South African 
Foreign Affairs, what are you likely to put in that report? 
  [Crewe-Brown] I would say that the very good relations that 
have existed between South Africa and Malawi will continue in 
the future because I think all the political parties in Malawi 
realize the importance of South Africa. And I don't think that 
any of the parties really wish to break off their relations with 
our country. In fact, I think with a new government in South 
Africa it will be easier for Malawi to maintain its relations 
with South Africa. 
  [Bishop] Well, Malawians rather like South Africans have a 
new constitution. How much difference will that make to the 
Malawians in the future? 
  [Crewe-Brown] A new government to Malawi is going to make it 
more acceptable in the international community. Last year they 
had many problems with donor communities who didn't want to give 
their aid any more because they felt that Malawi is neglecting 
the democratic rights of so many people. But I think with this 
whole process on the go now -- and the world will see that it 
was free and fair -- they will be prepared to give them the 
international aid that they require, and I think the relations 
of Malawi will improve certainly with its neighboring countries 
like Zambia and Tanzania. 
  [Bishop] Now, presuming that Dr. Banda loses the election, 
can you see peace after that, do you think there might be 
recriminations against his former regime? 
  [Crewe-Brown] I think we must remember that during the 
referendum last year, when the people voted for multiparty 
democracy, President Banda accepted it immediately without any 
reserves and I don't think that even if he did happen to lose 
this election, I'm sure he and his party will accept it; and I 
don't accept to have violent repercussions from that. President 
Banda has on numerous occasions stated that the people must 
please be calm, and also to accept the results, whatever they 
may be. 
  [Bishop] Finally, and I must ask this. Will there be any 
problems with counting the votes in the Malawian election? 
  [Crewe-Brown] I don't think we'll have the problems that we 
had in South Africa. The votes are counted in the presence of 
the local monitors and where possible in the presence of 
international monitors at each polling station. From there the 
votes are then taken through to the district commissioner, and I 
don't really think that we should have any serious problems 
there, and I expect that the final results should be out by the 
latest on Friday. But by tomorrow there should be an indication 
already how things stand. 
  [Bishop] Mr. Crewe-Brown, thank you very much for giving up 
your time. 
  [Crewe-Brown] Great pleasure.
