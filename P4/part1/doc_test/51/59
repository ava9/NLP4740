  [Excerpts] Bakili Muluzi will today become the second 
president of Malawi. [passage omitted] Yesterday, Bakili Muluzi 
appointed Justin Malewezi as vice president. Mr Malewezi is a 
former senior civil servant from the Banda administration. Also 
yesterday, the future president announced his program for 
Malawi, one of the poorest countries in the world. 
  [Begin Muluzi recording, in English with superimposed French 
translation] My first concern is the poverty in this country. 
Forty-five percent of our people live in rural areas. It goes 
without saying that these are the areas where you find this 
poverty. This issue was at the forefront of my campaign, and I 
would like to say that I think we'll have to take those areas 
very very seriously. 
  I also spoke of the social services, of the health sector. 
You know that out of every 1,000 children who are born here, 
230 die before the age of five, and that's very very serious. 
  We must finally look at the education sector: 54 percent of 
our population does not know how to read, and this is a very 
high proportion. Those are my three main priorities. [end
