<F P=106> [Interview with Dobromir Zadgorski, chairman of Nationwide </F>
Committee on Defense of National Interests, by Vanya Kamburova; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Kamburova] Mr. 
Zadgorski, in the declaration of the Fatherland Party of Labor 
[OPT] you expressed the opinion that you will appear in an 
alliance with the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] in the next 
elections also. How do you view the decisions of the 41st BSP 
Congress in this context? 
  [Zadgorski] The 41st BSP Congress definitely took place in a 
democratic spirit. There was a very constructive change at the 
congress -- the rejuvenation of the Supreme Council and the 
consolidation of the line according to which the BSP is led by 
young people. The election of Zhan Videnov as party chairman 
proves that the young cadres in the BSP are finding their place 
in the party's front ranks ever more. The congress gave carte 
blanche to the young members, and this is very good. We are 
especially satisfied with the decision on the early elections 
and the decision that denounces the Turkicization in the mixed 
population regions. 
  [Kamburova] How do you forecast the next elections? 
  [Zadgorski] Some 200,000 voters are behind us. Our 
organization is very strong in the six mixed regions. We have 
very strong positions in Varna, Dobrich, Ruse, and Veliko 
Turnovo. In Turnovo, for example, we have six city councillors. 
I definitely think that the coalition will win the election, 
and I will even take a risk and make a direct prophecy -- we 
will be 10-15 percent ahead of the Union of Democratic Forces 
[SDS]. We have a total of 90 municipal councillors in about 30 
cities and three deputies in the National Assembly. We think 
that our presence will grow after the new elections. I consider 
it very important that the BSP supports our views regarding the 
national interests. We are not allies in the literally sense of 
this word. We only formed a preelection alliance, which gives 
us the right to independence in adopting our decisions. We 
worked and will continue to work in a collegial manner in the 
parliament, and will continue to give priority to our national 
interests. 
  [Kamburova] Is there democracy in adopting decisions in the 
Parliamentary Union for Social Democracy [PSSD]? 
  [Zadgorski] Yes, the BSP does not impinge upon our right to 
adopt independent decisions. Our contradictions were related 
exclusively to issues regarding the cabinet of Professor Berov, 
because it was formed with the mandate of the Movement for 
Rights and Freedoms [DPS] -- a movement we do not recognize. We 
consider it an anti-Bulgarian movement. We voted against the 
government in all the no-confidence votes. We only supported 
the Budget Bill, because we thought that our country needs it. 
Those are no contradictions with our colleagues in the PSSD, 
but only different views. In all other cases we were united -- 
for example, the Yakoruda case, the UN corridor, Bulgaria's 
neutrality in the events in former Yugoslavia, and so forth. 
  [Kamburova] What difficulties does your party have in 
regions with a mixed population? 
  [Zadgorski] They spring first of all from the local 
administrative power, which is in the hands of the DPS. It does 
everything possible to assert itself among people of Bulgarian 
origin. Competent people are being fired and this is explained 
by pseudo-national interests. Our categorical objection is in 
this sphere. We also have problems with the "Dogan Law," but we 
try to protect the Bulgarians even in this sphere, naturally, 
without violating the interests of others. 
  [Kamburova] What is the influence of the DPS in those 
regions at the present moment? 
  [Zadgorski] The influence of the DPS in those regions is 
decreasing in a catastrophic manner. Even if the present 
Election Law with its 4 percent barrier remains, I think that 
they will have serious difficulties. The false nature of the 
interests of this movement's leaders was already grasped by the 
population. Some voted "with their feet," and left for Turkey. 
Others are bitterly disappointed, and they will not support the 
DPS. Yet others have lost their confidence and they will simply 
not vote.
