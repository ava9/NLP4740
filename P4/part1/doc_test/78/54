<F P=106> [Interview with Asen Michkovski, National Assembly deputy </F>
for the Alternative Social-Liberal Party, by Todor Tokin; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] [Tokin] Mr. Michkovski, unlike most of your 
colleagues in the ASLP [Alternative Social-Liberal Party], you 
have not yet left the NSD [New Alliance for Democracy]. 
  [Michkovski] I am still considering my decision. I think 
there is always time to leave any organization, including a 
parliamentary group. In this case, I am following the old 
Bulgarian proverb: "The quick bitch gives birth to blind pups." 
The main qualities that anyone who calls himself a politician 
in Bulgaria should have are patience and sober thinking. In 
politics I only support pragmatic actions that can really lead 
to something important. I have proved this during the last five 
years. The ASLP, of which I am deputy chairman, also displayed 
its pragmatism, and I hope that this will continue in the future. 
  [Tokin] The ASLP was expelled from the SDS [Union of 
Democratic Forces] because it supported Professor Berov's 
government. Have you any regrets that this happened? 
  [Michkovski] ASLP Chairman Nikolay Vasilev most accurately 
described the ASLP's expulsion from the SDS when he said that 
the SDS is shedding its own brains. All in all, this has been 
confirmed. Prof. Vasilev's definition has even been surpassed by 
the SDS leadership's cretinism. The recent acts of the 
so-called blue coalition can only be described in specialized 
medical literature. Psychopaths, cretins, and people who cannot 
see further than their own noses have dug a grave for the 
coalition, so that it has no importance for Bulgaria's future. 
The actions of Filip Dimitrov, Edvin Sugarev, and other 
individuals with unstable psychological and hormonal conditions 
have succeeded in really turning the SDS into a sect, making 
them people of no importance for the next National Assembly, in 
which they will have 10-12 seats. They have little chance in 
the struggle for power, and they do not even want power. They 
were in power, and at the moment they have a unique opportunity 
to seize it again, but they do not want to. Their only aim is 
to remain eternally in opposition and to guarantee places for 
themselves. 
  These are people with no love for their fatherland. Their 
blind allegiance to the United States or to anyone else, acting 
as if Bulgaria was a satellite, has completely destroyed the 
country's image. They continue to go about abroad defaming 
their native land. In general, these people are bankrupt. 
  [Tokin] Will the ASLP not expel you because of your refusal 
to obey the decision of the ASLP Political Council to leave the 
NSD? 
  [Michkovski] The ASLP is the most democratic structure in 
Bulgaria. Its organizational statute does not provide that its 
decisions are binding on anyone, and this includes the ASLP 
deputies. Furthermore, I have not said that I will not leave the 
NSD, I am simply making use of the democratic provisions of the 
party's statute to follow my democratic convictions. 
  [Tokin] Do you then concur with the reasons given by your 
colleagues who have left the NSD, such as Prof. Nikolay Vasilev 
and Georgi Kostov? 
  [Michkovski] I have absolute respect for the motives of all 
of them, including the individuals whom you mentioned. We 
simply differ in our assessment of the political moment, and 
most of all the political future of such an act. I do not 
consider that any formation that proclaims itself as so-called 
liberals can win the elections in Bulgaria, nor even form part 
of the political spectrum. Bulgaria is a state with a 
totalitarian past, so that here the reforms can only be carried 
out slowly and gradually, and on this subject I myself might 
admit my mistakes. I too was a supporter of the shock therapy, 
but this was about two and a half or three years ago. Now I 
think quite differently. Bulgaria's evolution toward becoming a 
modern state should proceed calmly, without shocks and without 
stigmatizing anyone. 
  [Tokin] What do you think about the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist 
Party]? 
  [Michkovski] What the BSP should do, but has not yet done, 
is very simple. It needs public legitimization both within and 
outside the country. It should admit the errors of those whom 
it succeeded and condemn those responsible for bringing the 
country into the present situation, but in no event is anyone 
entitled to strip the BSP of the right to be a legitimate 
political force. I am no supporter of the BSP and cannot be 
one, but, objectively considered, things show that the Bulgarian 
Socialists have a correct strategy and, all in all, it is only a 
question of time before they assume power. In general, I think 
that in the next parliamentary elections, whenever they take 
place, a left-of-center coalition will really sweep away 
everything else from the Bulgarian political scene. 
  [Tokin] Does the ASLP have a place in this coalition? 
  [Michkovski] This I am not sure about. In the final event, 
the congress is the body that can define our political allies, 
coalitions, and so on. I believe that social liberalism has a 
place in such a coalition, everything is a question of how one 
weighs things up. However, this should never be regarded as an 
act of petition. The ASLP is the most intelligent political 
formation and it has proved this during the last three years: 
Starting with an organization consisting of a group of 28 
people, it fought its way to power; it has taken part in power 
for two and a half years, and I think that it will remain a fact 
in the government of the country for a long time to come. 
  [Tokin] Will you personally continue to support the 
government? 
  [Michkovski] I personally support only those of the 
government's actions that relate to solving national problems, 
such as the efforts to finalize the settlement with the creditor 
banks of the London Club. I also support all actions by any 
department of the Bulgarian Government that are aimed at 
privatization and increasing the proportion of private ownership 
in the country. I support any actions by the government that 
encourage the development of Bulgarian national capital and 
create successful Bulgarian businessmen. With the same proviso, 
I also support what the government is doing to forge an 
independent Bulgarian foreign policy. 
  [Tokin] Does the NSD have a future? 
  [Michkovski] It never has been a political formation, merely 
a parliamentary alliance created to support sensible 
legislation, nothing more. Politically speaking, the NSD has 
never had any particular chances, and the same is true of the 
future. Only the strong and emerging party formations have a 
future. 
  [Tokin] Your colleagues who left the NSD claim that one more 
government may be formed within the term of this parliament. Do 
you share this view? 
  [Michkovski] I am skeptical. The only possibility is an SDS 
government, but the degree of cretinism within the SDS 
leadership has gone beyond all normal bounds. The Berov 
government is the last government that this parliament will 
have. I believe that no one in the country really wants 
elections, and I do not think they will be held this autumn. 
However strange it may seem, Prof. Berov's weak government will 
turn out to be quite tough and will last until the end of 1994. 
  [Tokin] A Sofia daily called you "the terminator." How do 
you react to this description? 
  [Michkovski] I can only express gratitude for such an 
assessment, but unfortunately my own view is different. I am a 
calm and normal person with no claims of being a terminator.
