Bulgaria's non-party 'government of technocrats', which has ruled since the
end of 1992, said yesterday it had decided to resign.
Mr Lyuben Berov, the prime minister, who has been incapacitated for months
by a heart attack, said on television that parliament was so hamstrung by
contradictory opinions that he believed new elections were the only
solution.
'In these circumstances, the government doesn't want to take the
responsibility for postponing early elections,' he said. 'Simple political
ethics require the government to re-tire. . . and make way for the
parliament to resolve. . . the political crisis in the country.'
President Zhelyu Zhelev said in a statement that the parliament now must
decide whether to call early elections.
Parliament may be divided over the wisdom of dissolving parliament and
calling early elections. The alternative would be to reshuffle the existing
government, possibly under a new prime minister, although the 68-year-old Mr
Berov is recovering.
The government, which is sustained by the votes of the powerful Bulgarian
Socialist Party (BSP) and the Movement for Rights and Freedom, a largely
ethnic Turk party, narrowly won a no-confidence vote in May. There was
widespread reluctance to create a political vacuum when Bulgaria was in the
midst of complex foreign debt negotiations. But agreement was reached with
London Club commercial bank creditors on June 30. The deal provided for a 47
per cent reduction in Bulgaria's hard currency debt of more than Dollars
8bn. The agreement triggered a raft of IMF, World Bank and other loans
required to finance the agreement and boost reserves.
Recent opinion polls indicate that the BSP, heir to the defunct communist
party, would emerge from elections as the largest single party, reflecting a
pattern already seen in Poland and Hungary, which returned socialist parties
to power earlier this year. But the BSP is internally divided into old-style
former communists and western-style social democratic factions and is
unenthusiastic about running for elections before resolving its internal
conflicts.
It is a similar story in the United Democratic Front (UDF), a loose umbrella
grouping of over a dozen 'democratic' parties formed after the collapse of
Soviet domination.
The UDF won the 1991 elections after the socialist party, which took over
power from the deposed communist dictator, Mr Todor Zhivkov, was attacked
for its close links with the old regime. But the UDF government led by Mr
Philip Dimitrov split and lost power a year later. This created a vacuum
which President Zhelu Zhelyev, one of the founders of the UDF, filled by
appointing the Berov-led government of technocrats which the votes of the
BSP helped keep in power.
The economy, which was badly hit by the collapse of Comecon markets and the
UN trade embargo against neighbouring Serbia, is recovering slowly. Nearly
half Bulgaria's foreign trade is now with the west, compared with only 9 per
cent four years ago.
Reuter adds from Sofia: The chief of staff of the Bulgarian army was
replaced yesterday after he opposed a government plan to retire 300
colonels. The cabinet asked President Zhelev, who is supreme commander of
the armed forces, to dismiss Lyuben Petrov after a closed session at which
it discussed a rift between him and Defence Minister Valentin Alexandrov.
