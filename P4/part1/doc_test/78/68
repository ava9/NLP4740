  [Text] Sofia, May 3 (BTA) -- The Bulgarian Socialist Party 
(BSP), supporting the government, insists that parliament 
discuss the cabinet's economic and social policy together with 
the report of the National Bank, said BSP Executive Committee 
member Doncho Konakchiev at a press conference today. According 
to him, within the next few days Prime Minister Lyuben Berov 
will propose concrete personnel and structural changes in the 
cabinet. The premier announced his intentions to make changes 
in the cabinet last Wednesday [27 April] in a declaration before 
parliament. 
  We are in touch with Prime Minister Berov and we hope he 
will 
keep his promises -- to restore dialogue with the trade unions, 
to make cost-of-living adjustments, to consolidate the foreign 
exchange and financial market, and strengthen national security, 
Mr. Konakchiev said. 
  The opposition Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) will 
consider 
its next steps at the end of parliamentary Easter recess, when 
the future of Lyuben Berov's Cabinet will become clearer, the 
top leadership of the coalition decided at its regular session 
today. Within a week the parties in the SDS will make proposals 
how to provoke the resignation of the cabinet and early 
parliamentary elections. 
  The government has come under serious trade union pressure. 
If Prime Minister Berov starts structural reforms without 
parliament's support, the Confederation of Independent Trade 
Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB) will block them, KNSB leader Prof. 
Krustyu Petkov said at a briefing today. The KNSB has called a 
warning general strike for tomorrow as part of the preparations 
for its general strike scheduled to start on May 17. The local 
structures of the other major trade union amalgamation -- 
Podkrepa -- will also take part in protest actions. The trade 
unions demand cost-of-living adjustment of the incomes of the 
population after prices doubled in two months with the steep 
slide of the lev against the U.S. dollar and the introduction of 
value-added tax on April 1. Prof. Krustyu Petkov said today 
that he expects 934 enterprises with over 200,000 workers to 
take part in the warning strike. 
  The KNSB also demands the coordination and adoption of a 
state policy for stabilizing the foreign exchange market, 
clarity on the protection of Bulgarian producers, and 
transparency regarding the obligations undertaken by Bulgaria to 
the international institutions. In a letter to Prime Minister 
Lyuben Berov European Confederation of Trade Unions Secretary 
General Emilio Gabaglo expressed support for the KNSB. Mr. 
Gabaglo has sent his personal adviser Peter Seideneck to observe 
the observation of the rights of the strikers during the warning 
strike. 
  This morning Prime Minister Lyuben Berov assured Prof. 
Petkov 
over the phone of his readiness to start negotiations on May 11 
and to personally head the delegation of the government (on 
which the KNSB insisted). This was announced today by the 
leader of the confederation. "However, the beginning of 
negotiations does not mean stopping strike actions," Prof. 
Petkov said. In an interview for today's issue of the PARI 
financial news daily, Prof. Petkov says that Prime Minister 
Berov is ready to make maximum compromises in order to reach an 
agreement. However, according to the KNSB leader, the stands of 
the Prime Minister and the KNSB on protecting the savings of the 
population and local production are diametrically opposed.
