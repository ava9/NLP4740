<F P=106> [Report by Evgeniya Drumeva: "Opposition SDS on Foreign </F>
Exchange Market and Government Economic Policy"] 
  [Text] Sofia, March 29 (BTA) -- The economic situation in 
this country is rapidly deteriorating, and one of the main 
reasons is the government's failure to attain its economic and 
financial objectives, the National Coordinating Council (the top 
leadership) of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) 
found at its meeting today. According to SDS, because of the 
crisis of political confidence in the government the lev lost 
nearly half its price against the U.S. dollar in the last three 
weeks. As long as this crisis of political confidence is 
deepening, nothing could stabilize the financial and 
foreign-exchange markets, said Ivan Kostov MP of SDS, former 
finance minister in two successive governments, in 1991 and 1992. 
  Back when the cabinet of independent economist Lyuben Berov 
was voted into office at the end of 1992, SDS declared itself 
against the "cabinet of independent experts" formula. Since 
that time, the opposition coalition has repeatedly pressed for 
early parliamentary elections and a politically committed 
government. 
  A week ago, SDS moved at the National Assembly a question to 
the government about its economic and financial policy and 
declared that after it hears the reply, it would demand the 
National Assembly to take a stand. "I expect parliament to 
criticize the cabinet for its actions and inactions which 
disrupted the country's economic system," Mr. Kostov told 
reporters today. In case the majority votes down such a stand, 
SDS will move yet another vote of no confidence in the cabinet. 
  The ex-Communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), which 
holds 
the majority in parliament at present, takes a softer line on 
the performance of the government. A week ago BSP called for 
faster and more resolute measures to end speculation on the 
foreign-exchange market and the lev depreciation. At the same 
time, however, the Socialists' leader Zhan Videnov said that 
"the foreign debt negotiations, rather than the dollar rate, are 
the government's top priority now". According to the 
Socialists, no personnel changes could be made now either in the 
government, or in the institutions concerned with the foreign 
debt negotiations. 
  SDS, however, believes that the cabinet has failed to reach 
a 
favourable agreement with the London Club creditor banks. SDS 
economists argue that Poland received a better offer in 
principle on a settlement of its loan. According to Ivan 
Kostov, this is further confirmed by "the fact that the 
foreign-exchange reserves and the expected financial grant and 
loan aid from abroad will not be sufficient for the government 
to attain its two goals: To close a deal with the London Club 
and keep the rate of the Bulgarian currency stable". "In the 
present currency market conditions, the depletion of 
foreign-exchange reserves makes financial stability practically 
impossible. All measures taken by the cabinet and the National 
Bank of Bulgaria proved counterproductive with their influence 
on the financial and foreign-exchange market. Instead of 
achieving stability and halting the Bulgarian lev depreciation, 
in reality we witness just the opposite. We believe the main 
reason is that this government has already lost political 
credibility with almost everybody in this country", Mr. Kostov 
believes.
