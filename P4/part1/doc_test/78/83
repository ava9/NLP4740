  [Text] President Zhelyu Zhelev expressed satisfaction with 
the resumption of contacts with the Greek New Democracy party 
[ND] during his meeting with this party leader, Miltiadhis 
Evert, which took place today. Presidential Spokesman Valentin 
Stoyanov had this to say about the meeting, which ended one hour 
ago: 
  [Begin Stoyanov recording] Relations between the two 
countries were assessed as very good. These are traditional 
relations that recently suffered a certain cooling off, which 
must be overcome. 
  From the Greek side it was pointed out that the parliament 
will soon ratify our country's provisional agreement with the 
European Union. The delay is not a premeditated act, but a 
result of the Greek elections. Evert proposed an interesting 
idea on preparing a treaty on the inviolability of borders that 
should be signed by all Balkan states. President Zhelev 
assessed the proposal as an interesting idea that merits serious 
attention. However, he pointed out that it could only be useful 
if all Balkan states without exception participate in the 
proposed treaty. Bulgaria and Greece could work actively in 
this respect, because they are two countries that have proved 
that they have no territorial claims vis-a-vis their neighbors, 
and conduct their policy in accordance with the Helsinki Act. 
Such a Balkan treaty could conform to Balladur's plan on 
European security. [end recording] 
  Evert came to Bulgaria to conduct consultations with 
Bulgarian politicians regarding his proposal. This became clear 
after his meeting with Aleksandur Tomov, leader of the Civic 
Alliance for the Republic, which took place early this 
afternoon. Evert also had a meeting with Filip Dimitrov, leader 
of the Union of Democratic Forces. Meetings with Bulgarian 
Socialist Party leader Zhan Videnov and Prime Minister Berov are 
also planned.
