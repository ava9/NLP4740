  [Excerpts] National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov 
is already at the National Assembly rostrum and Prime Minister 
Lyuben Berov is in the Assembly hall. Everything is ready for 
the official announcement. 
  [Yordanov] I call upon Mr. Kiril Zhelev to announce the 
results of the voting on the confidence motion in the cabinet of 
Lyuben Berov. 
  [Zhelev] A secret vote took place today at the request of 
the Council of Ministers to receive a vote of confidence. 
[passage omitted] Some 221 National Assembly deputies voted. 
Some 125 cast their ballots in support of the confidence 
motion, with 95 against. One National Assembly member cast an 
empty vote. There were no invalid ballots. On the basis of the 
results, the National Assembly of the Republic of Bulgaria, 
based on Article 112, Paragraph 1 of the Bulgarian Constitution 
and in connection with Article 83, Paragraph 4 of the 
Regulations on National Assembly Activity, has decided to grant 
confidence in the government in connection with its Program of 
Intent Until September 1994. 
  [Yordanov] Mr. Prime Minister, you may take the floor. 
  [Berov] Esteemed Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, and 
People's Representatives: It is usually customary on such 
occasions to express gratitude. However, I think that even 
those who, because of various reasons, oppose me would hardly 
envy me for the task that has been bestowed on me for the next 
three and a half months. This task is to steer the ship on 
which all of us are traveling through troubled voters, near 
dangerous rocks, and toward some safe port. This is a difficult 
task and this is a contradictory country. I promise to make 
every effort to implement my task and steer the ship toward a 
safe port. Thank you. [applause, jeers] 
  [Yordanov] Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. I now hand the 
floor over to Mr. Vasil Gotsev, who will speak on behalf of the 
Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] parliamentary faction. 
  [Gotsev] Esteemed Mr. Chairman, esteemed ladies and 
gentlemen, People's Representatives, and Mr. Professor Berov, 
who, after everything that has happened, I cannot calmly call 
Mr. Prime Minister: 
  We have witnessed another parliamentary farce, which took 
place in this hall last week. [passage omitted] After being 
supported by only 25 members of the National Assembly in last 
week's no-confidence motion proposed by the SDS, the prime 
minister failed to do what a prime minister should do in every 
democratic state where the parliament and the Constitution are 
respected -- resign. [passage omitted] Instead of doing this 
-- devoid of any political and human dignity, pardon the 
expression -- this prime minister forced us to vote confidence 
in connection with this government's plans until September 1994. 
[passage omitted] 
  Only 25 deputies gave you their vote of confidence last 
week. 
This means you did not receive a vote of confidence for what you 
have done so far. Why then did you ask for a vote of confidence 
until September? What parliament prolonged the life of this 
disgraceful cabinet by giving it their confidence? 
  Indeed, what actually took place today behind closed doors 
-- 
on the one hand, at the meeting of the Bulgarian Socialist Party 
faction, where long discussions were held and where prudent 
people certainly said that we must proceed toward early 
parliamentary elections and, on then other hand, in your room, 
Mr. Dogan? You implemented the instructions of the ambassador 
of a foreign state, the very same state that under the name of 
the USSR dictated everything that took place in our country. 
Today you obeyed the orders of [Russian] Ambassador Avdeyev. 
This shows the civilized world your true colors. 
  Ladies and gentlemen and people's representatives, we are 
witnessing the agony of our state, not just the agony of this 
government. All of you who supported a prime minister that 
disregarded the Constitution, the principles of 
parliamentarianism, and the interests of the Bulgarian people 
contributed to this agony. However, despite your desire to rule 
until the end of your life at the early elections, the Bulgarian 
people will cast their votes for those who today did not support 
you. [applause] 
  [Yordanov] Thank you, Mr. Gotsev. I close the session. The 
next session will take place tomorrow at 0900.
