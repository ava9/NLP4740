has sown the seeds of Hollywood's latest passion

When the cast and crew of Stargate celebrated its US premiere two weeks ago,
the most they hoped was that their clever little sci-fi film would become a
steady cult success.
Stargate, starring James Spader and Kurt Russell as intrepid adventurers who
fall foul of a sadistic villain played by Jaye Davidson, has become the hit
of the US autumn season. It grossed Dollars 16.7m in its opening weekend, a
record for a Halloween movie. A fortnight later it still tops the Variety
league after taking Dollars 34.5m.
Its success, following so shortly after that of Steven Spielberg's epic
Jurassic Park, has whetted Hollywood's appetite for science fiction. The
seventh Star Trek movie opens in the US on Friday and dozens of other sci-fi
movies are now in production and scheduled to appear next year.
The film industry is notoriously fickle, but science fiction has fallen in
and out of fashion in Hollywood to a greater degree than other genres.
Movies about life in outer space first surfaced in the 1930s with the Flash
Gordon and Buck Rogers series. Sci-fi reappeared in the trash films in the
1950s only to be eclipsed by the thrill of the real space race in the 1960s.
The genre was then elevated to cult status by Stanley Kubrick's 1968
classic, 2001: Space Odyssey, and Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 masterpiece,
Solaris.
It was not until the late 1970s that science fiction became big business.
George Lucas led the way in 1977 with Star Wars, which became one of the
biggest grossing movies ever, taking Dollars 323m in the US alone.
By the mid-1980s, however, the genre no longer seemed so fresh. The
futuristic films of that era, such as the Terminator series, were classified
as 'action' movies.
All that changed with Jurassic Park, which has grossed Dollars 356m in the
US since last year. It proved to the sceptical ranks of Hollywood
accountants that there was an audience for science fiction, just as the
success of Dances With Wolves in 1990 had heralded the return of the
western.
The digital dinosaurs created for Jurassic Park on the computers of
Industrial Light and Magic, the Dollars 60m special effects laboratory
founded by George Lucas, also acted as a showcase for the new generation of
digital special effects.
These enable film makers to create extraordinary visual images at relatively
low cost by cutting down on the number of extras, stunt artists and sets
needed to shoot a film.
James Cameron, director of Terminator and another techno buff, used the
computers at his Digital Domain special effects lab to create stunning
sequences in True Lies, such as a scene in which Arnold Schwarzenegger
'flies' his Harrier jet through Miami's skyscrapers. Thanks to the new
technology, George Lucas hopes to halve the cost of shooting the next
version of Star Wars to Dollars 50m.
The fantastical quality of digital images makes them ideal for science
fiction and has prompted a number of directors to try out the genre. The new
Star Trek will be followed by Judge Dredd starring Sylvester Stallone,
Strange Days with Ralph Fiennes, and a film version of the cult cartoon,
Tank Girl.
The sci-fi bandwagon shows no sign of stopping. Marlon Brando is tipped to
star in an adaptation of H G Wells's The Island of Doctor Moreau. The major
studios are competing to sign Luc Besson, the fashionable French director,
for Zaltman Bleros, his next Dollars 75m sci-fi epic. Even Stanley Kubrick
is making a new movie, AI, a film about artificial intelligence.
If Jurassic Park was the Dances With Wolves of sci-fi, Waterworld may prove
to be the genre's new Heaven's Gate - the 1980 movie that ended Hollywood's
love affair with the western by bombing at the box office.
Waterworld is an aquatic sci-fi adventure starring Kevin Costner. But the
production has been plagued with problems. The budget has rocketed to
Dollars 135m, making it the most expensive film ever.
Oscar Moore, editor-in-chief of Screen, the film industry magazine, said:
'Waterworld does have the makings of a disaster. There have been horror
stories about it from the start. But you can never be sure about anything in
this industry until the movie actually opens.'
