Television and video company Carlton Communications maintained its strong
market outperformance as some analysts took a close look at the latest data
for video sales.
Statistics in the trade press reveal that fourth-quarter sales of
pre-recorded films and programmes in the US rocketed from Dollars 177m in
1988 to Dollars 520.5m last year.
Carlton has the manufacturing and distribution rights for Disney and Warner
which last year accounted for 40 per cent of sales and will this year take
in sales of Snow White.
The forecast for this year's pre-Christmas sales is Dollars 934m, almost
double the 1993 figure. Carlton's slice of the cake might be reduced because
of competition from Jurassic Park, distributed by Rank, but it is a larger
cake.
Carlton shares have outperformed the broad market by 16 per cent over the
past year and 4 per cent over the past month. Yesterday the shares were
relatively strong against the market, closing only 5 off at 891p. Rank shed
5 to 412p.
