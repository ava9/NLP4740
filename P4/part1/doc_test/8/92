RISING SUN by Michael Crichton Knopf Dollars 22, 355 pages (UK publi cation
in June, Century Pounds 14.99)
ONE DOES not need to read very far into this techno-thriller before
encountering the first of numerous Japan-bashing remarks made by the book's
protagonists. By page 19 the reader is treated to a lecture on how the
nefarious Japanese are penetrating the heart of the US economic and
political systems: 'S***,' says a character, 'we're giving this country
away.'
Rising Sun may be a well-written thriller, but it is also an unpleasant
novel, full of near-racist slurs, exaggerations and, at times, pure
protectionist bunk. This is a book that panders to the worst of
anti-Japanese sentiment, which is perhaps why it is already a best-seller in
America.
On one level it is a mystery that follows two Los Angeles detectives as they
solve the murder of a beautiful young prostitute who is found strangled at a
lavish party given by Nakomoyo, the fictional Japanese company.
Fans of Michael Crichton, whose previous books include The Andromeda Strain
and Jurassic Park, will find all of the author's trademark best-selling
techniques - the fast-moving plot, the paper-thin character development, the
well-researched technical detail and such.
But the significance of this book, which given the current mood of America
seems destined to be one of the bigger best-selling US novels of the year,
lies not in the plot itself so much as in the constant vitriol that is
poured over the Japanese culture and Japanese business establishment.
Crichton would presumably deny that he is in any way racist and would
suggest that he is merely trying to address an issue of current public
interest - but the book is filled with the kind of low-brow and
crypto-racist sloganeering one hears from right-wing Republican presidential
candidates such as Patrick Buchanan and David Duke. 'We are at war with
Japan,' says a US Senator in the novel, who then proceeds to quote
colleagues who say 'sooner or later we're going to have to drop another
bomb.'
'So the Japanese dumped steel, televisions, consumer electronics, computer
chips, machine tools - and nobody stopped them. And we lost those
industries. Japanese companies and the Japanese government target specific
industries, which they take over. Industry after industry, year after year,'
says another character.
Rising Sun's message is blunt, and seemingly well researched. And it clearly
is striking a chord with many American readers. But the book is essentially
a pamphlet, a call to arms against the Japanese financial invasion of
America.
