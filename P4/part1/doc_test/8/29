role - MCA's quest for control

When Mr Yoichi Morishita, president of Matsushita, flew across the Pacific
on Tuesday, the distance between Osaka, where his company is based, and his
Californian destination, must have seemed greater than ever.
The head of the Japanese consumer electronics group made a hastily arranged
trip to San Francisco to find out why the men who run MCA, its US
entertainment subsidiary, had suddenly - and very publicly - demanded
independence from their Japanese owner.
The latest drama in Matsushita's four years as MCA's parent provides a stark
illustration of the difficulties that a conservative company, which values
consensus and long-term thinking, faces in running a business like MCA,
steeped in Hollywood's entrepreneurial and egotistical culture. It also
highlights the problems of MCA's executives in adapting to life under a very
different corporate regime.
It can be no consolation to Mr Morishita that the current crisis was widely
predicted when Matsushita bought MCA, which includes Geffen Records and
Universal Pictures, for Dollars 6.1bn in late 1990, shortly after Sony's
acquisitions of Columbia Pictures and CBS Records.
One investment banker commented that the the Japanese have 'no idea of the
difficulty of managing Hollywood companies with their prima donna culture of
limousines and private jets'.
Hollywood has for months been buzzing with rumours of rifts between MCA and
its parent. Yet Matsushita executives were clearly flabbergasted by last
week's reports that Mr Lew Wasserman, MCA's chairman, and Mr Sidney
Sheinberg, its president, were considering a bid to buy back control of
their business.
Matsushita, to an even greater degree than most Japanese companies, likes to
deal with its problems discreetly. Any sign of weakness from senior
management in the face of pressure from a US subsidiary would have been
perceived as loss of face.
MCA is also a critical component of Matsushita's long-term strategy in the
communications sphere. Without control of MCA's vast libraries of movies and
music - which include Jurassic Park and The Flintstones and chart-topping
albums from Nirvana and Aerosmith - Matsushita would be relegated to the
role of a low-margin hardware manufacturer.
Unsurprisingly, Mr Morishita said 'no' when Mr Wasserman and Mr Sheinberg on
Tuesday asked him to cede managerial control of MCA.
'What else could he have done?' asked Mr Christopher Dixon, entertainment
industry analyst at PaineWebber in New York. 'There's no question that
Matsushita is taking a long-term view of its investment. It's got to stick
with MCA.'
The two companies are now plotting their next moves in a high-stakes game.
The critical question is whether Mr Wasserman and Mr Sheinberg will stay at
MCA, where they have worked together for 22 years as the longest-running
management team in Hollywood.
Both men could easily afford to quit, having made substantial sums by
selling MCA shares to Matsushita. Mr Wasserman, 81, has already offered to
go next year. Mr Sheinberg, 59, may follow when his contract ends in 1995.
He, like his boss, has become increasingly dissatisfied with Matsushita's
refusal to back MCA's expansion plans.
They had hoped their wealthy Japanese parent would finance MCA's
participation in the wave of mergers and acquisitions that has swept the US
as broadcasters, cable TV operators, telecommunications companies and
entertainment groups have raced to position themselves in the interactive
media services market.
The US corporate frenzy has been watched with scepticism from across the
Pacific. Companies like Matsushita, accustomed to the slow, evolutionary
pace of development in consumer electronics, are dubious about the timing of
the multimedia revolution and its financial potential.
These differences came to a head when Matsushita blocked MCA's recent
attempt to acquire 49 per cent of NBC, the US television company. This,
coupled with a previous decision to veto the proposed purchase of Virgin
Records, fuelled MCA's fears of being left behind by dynamic rivals such as
Time Warner and Viacom.
Whatever Mr Wasserman and Mr Sheinberg decide to do, Matsushita must address
the issue of MCA's long-term strategy. Its efforts to do so will be
constrained by its ongoing rationalisation programme in Japan, given that it
will be reluctant to risk alienating its domestic workforce by sanctioning
aggressive expansion in the US.
MCA itself is in a vulnerable condition. Its performance was erratic in its
first few years under Matsushita. However, it produced record results in
1993 (when analysts suspect it made operating profits of up to Dollars 400m
on revenues of Dollars 4bn) thanks to the success of Geffen's music
releases, Jurassic Park and The Flintstones. This year's results are
expected to be rather less robust.
Moreover, Mr David Geffen, founder of Geffen Records, will leave MCA when
his contract expires in April. He may well be followed by Mr Steven
Spielberg, director of Jurassic Park and producer of The Flintstones, who
last week announced he was launching an entertainment group with Mr Geffen
and Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, former head of Walt Disney's movie studio.
Their departure would deprive MCA of two of its most prolific - and
profitable - talents at a time when it desperately needs successful new
concepts.
'No-one is ever irreplaceable,' said one analyst. 'But those two will be
very tough acts to follow.'
Mr Spielberg is an old friend of Mr Sheinberg. The latter had hoped the new
group might be persuaded to join forces with MCA if he and Mr Wasserman
could persuade the Japanese to cede control.
Instead, Matsushita's refusal has left MCA in turmoil.
