One of this year's intriguing themes will be whether supposedly cyclical
consumer stocks prove to be as cyclical as the market presumes. The high
savings ratio seemingly highlights the scale of latent demand. Confidence
appears to be returning, too. Rank's shares have benefited from such
optimism in the leisure sector, outperforming the market by 12 per cent over
the past year. Its annual figures contain some substance to underpin this
sentiment. The current 8 per cent gain in bookings for domestic holidays is
encouraging. Small volume gains are also being made elsewhere - even if
price rises are hard to achieve, as First Leisure noted this week.
But recovery may prove precarious with the chancellor poised to hit
consumers with more taxes. Other factors, too, may swing against Rank this
year. Rank Xerox will have to swallow its share of Xerox Corporation's
Dollars 700m restructuring charge. Jurassic Park can no longer be relied
upon to pull viewers through cinema doors. Rank's Pounds 995m debt burden
will continue to restrain any grander corporate ambitions. And the renewed
rumours that it will dispose of its stake in Rank Xerox could prove as
ill-founded as the more ambitious recovery hopes.
The tax implications of disposing of Rank Xerox would prove especially heavy
now that Mecca's acquired tax losses have been exhausted. Rank may prefer to
hang on to the asset rather than sell it to pay down its debts. But Xerox's
poor prospects in mainland Europe are another reason to expect modest
progress at Rank this year.
