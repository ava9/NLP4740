FT  18 SEP 93 / Lights, camera - reaction]: France's film industry fears a
loss of identity if culture is included in Gatt

We cannot allow the Americans to treat us as they did the Redskins,' Mr
Bertrand Tavernier told the European parliament this week. He and other
French film directors fear that, if the cinema is included in the Gatt trade
negotiations, Hollywood will either kill off their livelihood or force them
on to some ever-shrinking cultural reservation.
So, a kind of Stars War has broken out between the US and France, already at
Gatt loggerheads over agriculture. Mr Jacques Toubon, France's culture
minister, said this week that his government 'will not sign' a Gatt deal
that covers, however marginally, the audiovisual industry.
The threat of a French veto is nothing like as real over the cinema as over
farm trade. But the Gatt negotiations enter the home straight just as France
is bracing itself for what its culturally prickly establishment sees as
another wave of American celluloid imperialism. Yesterday Ted Turner's new
TNT/cartoon satellite channel started beaming across Europe, and Steven
Spielberg's Jurassic Park is about to hit French cinemas next month.
Gerard Depardieu, the thinking woman's truck-driver, and star of the French
cinema, joined Mr Tavernier and many other actors, producers and directors
in Strasbourg this week to lobby MEPs. He stoutly denies that, by taking up
cudgels against the US in Gatt, suspect he is being 'anti-American'. He
himself has appeared in US films, and has indeed helped distribute some in
Europe.
But he also recognises that Hollywood is 'a war machine, a state within a
state', which has captured nearly 60 per cent of the French market, holds an
average share of 80 per cent in Europe, and is voracious for more. Depardieu
says France's cinema constitutes 'our identity', which others claim he
incarnates personally.
'Gerard Depardieu is as much a symbol for the French as John Wayne was for
Americans,' says Mr Rene Cleitman, head of Hachette Premiere, which produced
the highly successfully Cyrano de Bergerac with Depardieu in the star role.
Films have a wider role in conveying a whole lifestyle, says Mr Nicolas
Seydoux, head of the Gaumont cinema chain, pointing out that, 'without
Westerns, blue jeans would not have invaded the whole world'.
Just as in France's other international dramas over currencies and farming,
the 'Anglo-Saxons' - a term more widely used in France than anywhere else -
are cast as the villains, with the British always wearing some of the 'black
hats'. Sir Leon Brittan, the senior UK commissioner who is chief Gatt
negotiator in Brussels, is seen as the man who, wittingly or not, is about
to sell the French cinema down the river.
In fact, the quarrel arises out of a difference over tactics, not aims. Sir
Leon stresses that Hollywood should not, and will not, be allowed to
steamroller Europe's cultural identity. But his US opposite number, Mr
Mickey Kantor, who happens to hail from the tinsel town of Los Angeles, has
insisted that the audiovisual sector counts as a service for inclusion in
the Gatt.
Since Brussels is keen that no services should be allowed to escape the Gatt
 -precisely because Washington has tried to keep some financial, transport
and telecommunications services out of the Gatt - Sir Leon is suggesting
including the audiovisual dossier in the Gatt, but safeguarding it with a
clause declaring its 'specificity'. He believes that this would give
Europe's audiovisual industry protection against any unilateral US action.
France's government and film industry believe this to be a fundamental
miscalculation, and urge that Europe should make the audiovisual industry a
formal 'exception' to the Gatt (as Canada did with its film industry in its
free trade deal with the US). The threat of American bullying, outside Gatt,
is phoney, says Mr Dominique Wallon, head of France's powerful Centre
National de la Cinematographie. 'What could the Americans retaliate against,
when we have only 1 per cent of their market?' he queries.
Worse, 'putting the very complex French system of film support under the
Gatt would at best freeze it, preventing its further development, and at
worst lead over time to its dismantling, piece by piece', Mr Wallon fears.
'Very complex' is indeed an understatement about a system which helps French
film-makers at every step:
Some FFr1.6bn (Pounds 182m) a year is raised, from levies of 5.5 per cent on
TV stations' turnover, 11 per cent on cinema tickets and 2 per cent on video
distributors' turnover, to back new films.
FFr600m a year in public money goes to help script-writers, to copy films,
renovate cinemas and even promote cinema studies in the classroom.
French programmes must fill no less than 40 per cent of TV stations' prime
airtime, and EC-made programmes at least 60 per cent. They also have to
'pre-buy' a certain number of French films a year.
For their part, radio stations have a French content requirement of 15-65
per cent. Hardest to meet, says Mr Andrew Manderstam, head of the RFM radio
rock station, is a requirement to play records by relatively unknown
'nouveaux talents' twice an hour.
So, in a sense, France has already put its film industry on an Indian
reservation against further encroachment from Hollywood's cavalry. Yet this
self-protectionism does not appear to have dulled the creativity of French
cinema, which - with the decline of its Italian and UK counterparts - is
Europe's largest and most successful. The evidence is that French filmgoers
want to go on having the best of both worlds (their own and America's),
rather than end up with the worst as well as the best of one Americanised
world.
