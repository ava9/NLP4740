The success of Steven Spielberg's film Jurassic Park has brought reflected
glory to a three-year old Belfast technology company.
Audio Processing Technology, which has a staff of just 20, is providing the
vital component in the cinema sound system which gives digital, rather than
analogue, dinosaur roars.
APT has developed a way of compressing the soundtrack of the film so that it
can be put on a compact disc which is synchronised to play alongside the
film.
The idea for digital sound first came from Spielberg himself, who wanted to
explore the idea of a superior soundtrack to accompany his blockbuster.
Spielberg, along with Universal Studios and others, was instrumental in
setting up the Californian company Digital Theatre Systems which builds the
cinema playback systems which incorporate APT's technology
Demand for the sound systems has grown to such an extent that APT's managing
director Stephen Smyth believes that there will be more than 5,000 cinemas
using the system by the end of year - as far apart as the US, Japan and
Europe.
The compression algorithm squeezes the sound into one quarter of the space
usually needed by removing the redundancy in the soundtrack. This means the
six-channel stereo soundtrack can be supplied on CD. The technique is not
dissimilar to that used by Sony to compress music on to its mini-disc
system.
Smyth points out the chips can also be used in the transmission of calls
over the latest digital telephone lines or the preparation of soundtracks
for television programmes.
Cinemas not equipped with the digital system can still show Jurassic Park
because, as is conventional in film recording, each film has the analogue
soundtrack of blood-curdling screams and the pounding of prehistoric feet
optically recorded alongside the pictures.
A further advantage of this, reassures Smith, is that should the latest
digital equipment break down, the projection would automatically revert to
the analogue soundtrack.
