Twenty-seven film-going days to Christmas, and distributors are bringing out
the heavy artillery. Lord Richard Attenborough, long suspected of being
Santa Claus in disguise, comes clean in Miracle On 34th Street. The film,
opening this week, updates the 1947 comedy about a department-store Father
Christmas who doesn't quite behave according to plan. Miracle has had a
10-gun critical salute in the US, where they enjoy the sight of
distinguished Limey actors forced to remake Hollywood classics. For Britain,
it may provide Yuletide cheer in a thinly-supplied season.
Though Macaulay Culkin and Danny DeVito are back with us in soon - one in a
cartoon/live-action fantasy, the other in a comedy about Arnold
Schwarzenegger getting pregnant (sic) - the only sure treat to date is last
week's commendation: the Gothic and glorious Nightmare Before Cristmas.
Alternatively, you could pile up the videos by the flickering VCR. Snow
White and Jurassic Park are current chart-toppers. But why not be
adventurous and try John Sayles's Passion Fish, the moving, quirky tale of a
Louisiana-dwelling TV actress (Mary McDonnell) rediscovering her life after
a paralysing accident; or Kieslowski's White, the bleakly funny second part
of his 'three colours' trilogy, all about corruption, longing and l'amour
fou. If adventurousness fails, there is always the two-year-old Ace Ventura:
Pet Detective. Jim The Mask Carrey puts in an early bid for superstardom,
helped by a dog and a dolphin. For children of all ages, or anyone
house-bound by the Christmas spirit.
And a postscript for repertory cinema lovers. The National Film Theatre
begins two piquant seasons: one devoted to women screenwriters - yes, they
were up and running in Hollywood long before feminism got started - and the
other to 'Shakespeare: The Musical' - Kiss Me Kate, West Side Story, The
Boys From Syracuse. As Verdi realised in Otello and Macbeth (also present):
just because a man is the world's greatest playwright doesn't mean he can't
be improved by a good tune.
