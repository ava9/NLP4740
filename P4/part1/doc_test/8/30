FT  11 AUG 93 / Arts: Going Out versus Staying In - Television

It is, people insist, much the best to be there: whether Wimbledon or the
Royal Tournament, rock festival or Comedy Store; while television may convey
an approximation of the 'real' experience, there is no substitute for
actually going along. In the past this column has considered the subject
specifically in relation to sport and concluded that there is, indeed, a
certain something - the strawberry factor - about going to Wimbledon, and
risking skin cancer from all that sun for the sake of the smell of crushed
grass.
Yet there is also a powerful argument for staying on the old green sofa in
the cool of your own sitting room in front of your television. At home there
are no men in uniforms ordering you about, you can drink your own properly
chilled Sancerre, and people do not sit behind you explaining Navratilova's
sexual relationships in stage whispers. Travel time to and from the sofa is
negligible, and at home you have all the advantages of umpteen camera
positions and the zoom lens which are denied those who pay the appalling
price of a Centre Court ticket.
What about the sort of events more commonly reviewed on this page though?
Can television ever hope to provide more than a vague idea of the experience
of sitting in a West End theatre as the house lights go down, of being a
part of a big audience dominated by the big screen in a cinema, of feeling
the expectation in a concert hall as the conductor raises his baton? A
refresher course in Going Out can leave you in two minds. Certainly there
are aspects of live entertainment that television fails to convey, but the
incidentals, at least in a big city  - travel, tickets, food and drink,
fellow members of the audience - can be enough to make you vow never to
relinquish the old green sofa again.
In comparing the two experiences we do tend to underestimate the sheer
convenience of television. In London today, unless you have a chauffeur, the
only way of being sure you can reach any venue and park close by is to drive
a motorcycle, and not everyone is as game as Mrs Dunkley when it comes to
riding pillion. (Yes, when necessary in evening dress.) You can easily spend
the price of a whole year's licence fee on two opera tickets or three
moderate seats in a Shaftesbury Avenue theatre. In the all too accurately
named crush bar two glasses of ghastly blended table wine will cost you
around Pounds 4, and there is a dreadful tendency now to provide only
'souvenir' programmes which means the format of Radio Times and a price of
Pounds 6.
While you have control over those with whom you watch television, the same
is obviously not true when you Go Out. If you are fortunate enough to be
invited by John Drummond, director of the BBC Proms, to share his box, as we
were on Sunday, you may find yourself sitting with Sir David and Lady
Attenborough - and what could be more pleasant. However, buy yourself a
couple of Pounds 25 seats at the Prince Edward to see the Gershwin musical
Crazy For You and you may find yourself towards the back of the circle
behind three vast teenage girls who continually lean forward in their seats,
forcing everyone behind to do the same, and eat sweets out of cellophane
bags seemingly prepared by some insane sound effects department. That does
not happen with television.
As for the cinema, on the day after we saw Jurassic Park last week it was
announced that this had become the biggest grossing movie of all time in
Britain, a fact which scarcely surprised us since we had had to pay Pounds
10 each for seats, not in the West End but at the Parkway, Camden Town.
True, when we left the cinema there was a pianist playing in the bar,
supporting the claim printed on the back of the tickets that they are
'Making movie going an occasion'. But it was also true that we sat through
the film with our feet on a thick layer of popcorn, on top of a worn-out and
badly torn carpet. Funny sort of occasion.
But what about the content of these events? Spielberg's dinosaur
extravaganza is so determined to terrify the life out of you that it
produces a defiant reaction: 'Garn] Can't frighten me]' Yet it is one of
those films that will lose much of its impact when it comes to television.
Whereas the subtle frights of a Hitchcock can be as effective on the small
screen as the large, Jurassic Park relies upon the overwhelming size of its
cinema images and the deafening volume of trillion-track Dolby sound for its
effect, and those will not be available on the box. So if you do want to see
dinosaurs chasing children and crunching adults, see it in the cinema. Score
one, reluctantly, for Going Out.
We happened to see Crazy For You on the same night that the Queen took her
mother for a 93rd birthday treat, along with her sister and umpteen other
members of the royal family. This created an even more monumental traffic
jam than usual around Soho, and thus even more smugness among motorcyclists.
There may have been another effect, too: the company seemed to perform with
abnormal energy, as companies will when the royals are in. Since this is a
classic American musical with a tap line 10-babes long, and a great
basketful of Gershwin hits - 'Someone To Watch Over Me', 'I Got Rhythm',
'They Can't Take That Away From Me' and many more - the effect was
electrifying . . . or perhaps they really are that good every night.
Anyway, even without any special royal edge, there is something about the
stage musical which has never been transferred successfully to television.
To experience the full sense of hair-raising exhilaration from, say, a
massed tap routine you have to be in a theatre seeing the thing live, with
no chance of anyone 'dubbing in the taps'. The same goes for those typically
American stage-wide dance routines, such as Embraceable You in this show,
where there is no chance, as with television, of cutting together the best
bits from five takes, and the dancers end up, chests heaving for breath,
with the whole house on a roar. Score another, very definitely, for Going
Out.
As for the Proms, the experience varies. When the front promenaders turned
round on Monday last week and chanted 'Arena to gallery: tonight's concert
can be heard on Radio 3' even Mr Drummond seemed to think they had a point,
murmuring 'They've been quite witty this year'. The point was that The
Hanover Band playing an all-Bach programme on period instruments did not
produce a great enough volume of sound, some of the time anyway, for the
marvellous and familiar but very large space inside the Albert Hall. That
said, the Concerto for Violin and Oboe, and especially Anthony Robson's
performance on the oboe, was simply splendid, large space or not. But had
this been televised, home viewers would have had no trouble at all with
sound - as the promenaders' message indicated. Score one for Going Out and
one for staying home.
So Going Out emerges from this refresher course pretty robustly; the
vitality of live events and the uniqueness of each performance score
heavily. However, if you throw the incidentals into the scales the balance
tips back dramatically towards the old green sofa. And what could you see on
television in the past week? The second part of Billy Roche's powerful
Wexford Trilogy, first performed at The Bush, a tiny fringe theatre with a
name for innovation but cramped and uncomfortable seating. The third in a
new series of the amazingly effective (even if, perhaps because, the content
can be infuriating) Teenage Diaries, a form impossible to imagine outside
television. A repeat of a hilarious episode of French And Saunders (with the
'Looky Likeys', a parody of The Exorcist and an embarrassingly accurate
publisher's lunch) and more. Of course watching television is not the same
as being there, but nor is being there the same as watching television. You
miss an awful lot if you go out every night.
