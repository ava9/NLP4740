<P>
Universal Pictures has paid $2 million for screen rights to Michael Crichton's 
new science-fiction novel "Jurassic," which will not be published until the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
The record-setting price for the novel will be more than matched by the 
studio's estimated $40-$50 million budget for the movie, which will be directed 
by Steven Spielberg and produced by his Amblin Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Three other studios, 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros. and Columbia, were in the 
chase for "Jurassic" with bidding opening at $1.5 million. Crichton will write 
his own screenplay.
