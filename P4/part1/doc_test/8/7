SCIENCE today feeds the Hollywood hype machine the last morsel it needs to
promote Steven Spielberg's latest film. On the eve of Jurassic Park opening
in the US, a research team has announced that it has extracted the first
samples of genetic material from the dinosaur era.
The researchers include Dr George Pionar of the University of California,
Berkeley, who was a scientific adviser to the heavily promoted Jurassic
Park.
Its plot is based on the use of genetic engineering to re-create dinosaurs,
starting from the DNA in blood sucked by mosquitoes that were then preserved
in amber for more than 100m years.
The Pionar group has isolated insect DNA from a weevil trapped 120m years
ago in Lebanese amber. It is 80m years older than any DNA extracted
previously from amber - fossilised tree resin that has a unique capacity to
preserve organic material - and is the first from an animal alive when
dinosaurs roamed the earth.
Such a discovery would have seemed like science fiction be-fore researchers
started studying ancient genes in the mid-1980s. It depends on
gene-amplifying technology called polymerase chain reaction, which enables
scientists to make billions of copies of any piece of DNA.
The Californian scientists obtained enough DNA to carry out a genetic
comparison with present-day weevils. But it represents less than
one-millionth of the ancient creature's total genetic complement - all of
which would be needed to resurrect the extinct species.
Nature, the UK journal which publishes the Californian DNA research in
today's issue, insists that its release a day before the film is 'pure
coincidence'.
