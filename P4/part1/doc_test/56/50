<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 4101 (a) and (b) of OPA 90 amend 46 U.S.C. 7101 and 7302, respectively, to require every person who applies
for the issuance or renewal of a license, COR, or MMD to have a chemical test for dangerous drugs. On March 4, 1994, the
Coast Guard published an NPRM in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 entitled ``Chemical Testing for Dangerous Drugs of Applicants for Issuance or Renewal of Licenses, Certificates
of Registry, or Merchant Mariner's Documents'' (59 FR 10544) (CGD 91&hyph;223). The Coast Guard originally intended
to merge the chemical testing requirements and the regulations for terms of validity into one final rule. However,
the Coast Guard has decided to publish these rules separately in order to facilitate public participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by OPA 90, the Coast Guard is also developing a rulemaking which addresses how review of information in
the National Driver Register and a criminal record review will become part of the license, COR, and MMD renewal process
(CGD 91&hyph;212).

Discussion of Comments and Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thirteen letters were received in response to the NPRM. The Coast Guard has reviewed all of the comments and, in some
instances, revised the proposed regulations as appropriate. The comments have been grouped by issue, and are discussed
as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. User Fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments objected to the proposed Coast Guard user fees for renewals of MMDs and CORs. As stated in the NPRM,
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 amended 46 U.S.C. 2110 to require the Coast Guard to establish and collect
user fees for services it provides under 46 U.S.C., subtitle II. The Coast Guard has no discretion in the decision to
establish fees for these services. The fee amounts for issuance of CORs and MMDs and for issuance and renewal of licenses
were set by a final rule entitled ``User Fees for Marine Licensing, Certification of Registry and Merchant Mariner
Documentation'' (58 FR 15228; March 19, 1993) (CGD 91&hyph;002). These rules became effective April 19, 1993. At
that time, CORs and MMDs were not being renewed so that rule did not establish fee amounts for COR and MMD renewals. Therefore,
fee amounts for COR and MMD renewals are set in this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulatory evaluation in this final rule discusses the fee amounts. For a summary of how the fee amounts were set,
see the ``Regulatory Evaluation'' section of this rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Concurrent Renewals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment suggested a reduced fee for mariners who renew more than one merchant mariner credential at the same time.
This approach was outlined in the NPRM and remains unchanged in the final rule. The Coast Guard encourages concurrent
renewal of merchant mariner credentials whenever possible. However, all renewal requirements for each license,
COR, or MMD must be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Renewal Evaluation Fees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When CORs or MMDs are renewed in conjunction with the renewal of a license, the Coast Guard will charge only the license
renewal evaluation fee, since the evaluation for a license encompasses all factors considered in evaluating applicants
for MMDs. When CORs or MMDs are renewed in conjunction with one another, but not in conjunction with a license, the Coast
Guard will charge only the MMD renewal evaluation fee, if applicable, since there is no COR renewal evaluation fee.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Renewal Exercise Fees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When an MMD is renewed concurrently with a license and the applicant must take an open-book exercise for each renewal,
the applicant need only pay the license exercise fee. If a license and MMD are renewed concurrently and the only open-book
exercise is for an MMD, then the applicant will pay the MMD exercise fee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Renewal Issuance Fees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It should be noted that a separate issuance fee will always be charged for each license, COR or MMD issued, regardless
of whether the credential(s) are issued concurrently or individually.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Physical Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Merchant Marine Personnel Advisory Committee recommended to the Coast Guard that individuals holding MMDs with
qualified ratings be required to undergo physical examinations when renewing MMDs. The Coast Guard has included
such a requirement in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments addressed the physical requirements for renewal of MMDs with endorsements. The comments stated that
the physical standards for renewal of MMDs with endorsements should not be the same as the physical standards for the
original issuance of MMDs with endorsements. In response to these comments, the Coast Guard revised the physical
examination section for MMD renewal, making it consistent with the physical examination section for license renewal.
The physical examination for renewal of a license does not require the applicant to be tested for color sensitivity;
however, the physical examination for original issuance of a license does require a color sensitivity test. This
is the only difference in physical requirements between original issuance and renewal of licenses. The Coast Guard
has revised the physical examination section for renewal of MMDs with endorsements to no longer require a color sensitivity
test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that while the examination requirements are slightly different, the medical standards the Coast
Guard applies to determine if a mariner is qualified for a license or document are the same regardless of whether the
license or document is an original or a renewal. The Coast Guard believes that these standards are the minimum necessary
to ensure safe service under a license or document and are therefore appropriate for both originals and renewals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Professional Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment suggested that individuals holding MMDs with qualified ratings, who serve as officials for unions in
positions closely related to the training and servicing of active seamen should be required to show only 1 year of employment
to meet the professional requirements for renewing an MMD. The professional requirements are intended to ensure
that mariners maintain their professional knowledge and keep abreast of current technology. The NPRM proposed 3
years of employment in a position closely related to the operation, construction, or repair of vessels (either deck
or engineer, as appropriate) as a substitute for 1 year of sea service. The Coast Guard believes that 1 year in a position
of closely related maritime service, including training and servicing of active seamen, does not provide experience
equivalent to 1 year of actual sea service. Therefore, the final rule retains the 3 year time requirement for all forms
of closely related service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment expressed concern about using an open-book ``examination'' as a substitute for sea service when renewing
an MMD with an endorsement. The open-book renewal exercise will provide a means for those individuals who are not actively
sailing or involved in the industry to maintain a working familiarity with the skills necessary to work in the industry.
The renewal exercise contains general subject matter pertaining to the various endorsement(s) of the MMD and requires
a 90 percent passing grade. The Coast Guard has concluded that this is an acceptable means of ensuring that endorsement
holders continue to maintain their professional knowledge.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Continuity Endorsement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to several comments, the Coast Guard has included in the final rule a provision to renew MMDs ``For Continuity
Purposes Only.'' This provision follows the same procedures as the renewal policy for license holders. Individuals
renewing MMDs with qualified ratings who cannot meet the professional or physical requirements will have the endorsement
``Continuity only; service under document prohibited'' placed on the MMD. Holders with this continuity endorsement
may have the service prohibition rescinded at any time by satisfying the renewal requirements not previously met
and paying the appropriate renewal fees.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Other Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another comment addressed the renewal of Continuous Discharge Books (CDB) which the Coast Guard issues to merchant
mariners for a chronological record of seagoing employment. Regulations listed in 46 CFR 12.02 cover issuing additional
CDBs. Because OPA 90 does not address CDBs and because CDBs alone do not allow employment on a merchant ship, no change
to the regulations is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment stated that the NPRM did not address the grace period provision for MMD expiration dates determined
by Table 12.02&hyph;29. The grace period explained under &sect;12.02&hyph;27(e) applies to all MMD expiration
dates including MMD expiration dates specified in Table 12.02&hyph;29. For example, an MMD issued on January 1, 1966,
would expire on January 1, 1996 under Table 12.02&hyph;29. The holder of that MMD will have a 12 month period of grace,
running until January 1, 1997, in which he or she may renew the document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment pointed out that the description of the procedures for renewal of MMDs by mail was not detailed enough.
The Coast Guard has provided additional detail in &sect;12.02&hyph;27(e)(3) of the regulations.
