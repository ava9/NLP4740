HOSPITAL SHIP CONVERSION PROJECT HITS FINANCIAL SHOALS

Like a ghost ship at the mercy of the elements, the Oceanic sits idly in the 
harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Below the bare decks, darkened passageways strewn with debris lead to crew's 
quarters containing bunks without mattresses and toilets without plumbing. On a 
table near the bridge lay two old maps, one of the Maine coast, the other 
showing New York's Hudson and East rivers from Governor's Island to 67th 
Street. In the galley next to a bowl of rotten grapes and a crumbled cigarette 
carton, a dusty guest book bears entries that end on Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
That is the last time anybody but journalists has been aboard the Oceanic. For 
more than a month, the vessel has been anchored a few hundred yards offshore 
near the Long Beach Naval Station in the Port of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
There are those who envision the ship -- which is painted white with a huge red 
cross on its side -- as a majestic floating hospital that will one day carry 
volunteer doctors to needy ports in Mexico and Central America. In reality the 
vessel, accessible by water taxi at a fee of $100 an hour, is at the center of 
a bureaucratic dispute that may keep it anchored for some time. 
</P>
<P>
The most immediate problem is that Los Angeles port officials will not let the 
ship berth until it can operate under its own power. But its skipper says the 
ship can't operate under its own power until port officials let it berth for 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The project "just might go down the tubes," complained Tom Keegan, a former 
Merchant Marine captain, now in a wheelchair, who skippers the Oceanic. "That 
would be sad for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Counters Ed Hill, the port's chief wharfinger: "The ship's a long way from 
being operable. Putting her in port would be dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Keegan, 49, first conceived his dream of delivering medical supplies and 
services to Third World countries after a 1985 motorcycle accident paralyzed 
him from the chest down, ending a seagoing career that had spanned 25 years. 
Becoming acquainted with the medical technology that saved his life, he said, 
helped him recognize the dearth of proper medical equipment and services in 
many of the ports he had visited. 
</P>
<P>
"People south of the border in my condition wouldn't have survived," he said. 
"They don't need food down there as much as they need medical attention." 
</P>
<P>
When he heard of an available ship with 7,500 square feet of covered deck space 
and 800 tons of storage capacity, the captain rejoiced. Built by the Canadian 
government in 1969, the Oceanic -- formerly called the Atlantic Jag -- served 
as a tuna clipper for several years before being purchased by Sea Trec 
Enterprises Inc., a shipbuilding firm in Chula Vista that intended to convert 
it into a salmon processor. But financing for the project fell through, leaving 
the 200-foot vessel tied up and losing money. When Keegan suggested converting 
it into a hospital, the owners agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a pretty convincing chap," said Sea Trec owner Doug Lotoski, whose wife 
is a nurse. "He's got a good idea, the ship would be ideal for the project and 
he is very very sincere. So we thought we'd give him a shot." 
</P>
<P>
Although Sea Trec still owns the vessel, Lotoski said, the company has agreed 
to sell it eventually to Keegan for an unspecified amount. In the meantime, he 
said, the captain has full possession of the vessel as he attempts to add four 
operating rooms, eight recovery beds, three dental chairs, an X-ray machine, 
orthopedic unit and complete blood lab. 
</P>
<P>
Just how he intends to accomplish all that is still rather vague. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nonprofit Status 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, Keegan set up a nonprofit organization headed by Dr. Alton 
Ochsner, a New Orleans surgeon. "The idea is very good," said Ochsner, who also 
heads a private foundation that provides medical aid to the indigent in the 
Caribbean. "We've been slow in getting this thing going." Ochsner said he first 
heard of Keegan's work through a mutual friend in the medical community. 
</P>
<P>
Others listed as members of Keegan's board of directors include Dr. P. William 
Oysinger, a professor of internal medicine at Loma Linda University; Frank C. 
Flores Jr., a dentist on the staff of the USC School of Dentistry; Robert E. 
Green, a dentist in private practice in Highland, Calif., and Alejandro 
Rostran, a member of the New Orleans Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
According to Keegan, the proposed remodeling of the Oceanic -- as well as the 
plans for its eventual operation with the help of volunteer doctors and crew 
members -- is being overseen by board members and various volunteer medical 
technicians. The remodeling work, he said, will be done by several local 
maritime unions that have offered to work for free. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for San Bernardino Community Hospital, where Keegan once was a 
patient, said hospital staff members are collecting used medical equipment to 
donate to the project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support Promised 
</P>
<P>
The captain also carries a sheath of letters from foundations, private 
companies, medical centers, doctors, hospitals and politicians promising 
various levels of moral, material and financial support. 
</P>
<P>
What Keegan does not have much of, however, is cash. 
</P>
<P>
So several weeks ago he moved the ship up the coast from San Diego to San Pedro 
in an effort to attract more attention and thereby generate more contributions. 
Because of a defective generator and other problems, however, the ship had to 
be towed all the way. Now, its inability to move under its own power has become 
an albatross that threatens to sink the project altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. Army has offered to let Keegan use one of its docks for the 
90 days he estimates it will take to convert the Oceanic to medical use, the 
dock at Berth 55 in San Pedro was not immediately available the day the vessel 
arrived. So port officials decided to give the ship temporary berthing nearby. 
But after a short grace period during which little apparent progress was made, 
they had the ship unceremoniously towed to its present out-of-the-way location 
in the outer harbor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He Needs Three Weeks 
</P>
<P>
"That's a surge area," Hill said, referring to the fact that the Army's Berth 
55 is subject to changing tide levels, which sometimes require vessels to be 
moved. "We don't put dead vessels there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keegan says he needs at least three more weeks in port to do the repairs 
necessary to make the ship seaworthy. Hill says that to let an inoperable ship 
tie up any longer would have constituted an unacceptable hazard. And hanging 
over everything is the $114-a-day tariff normally charged by the port for ships 
the size of the Oceanic. 
</P>
<P>
Keegan says he can't afford the tariff and that it ought to be waived. Hill 
says that a decision to waive the tariff could be considered only if Keegan can 
prove that the Oceanic is a bona fide relief vessel destined for a country 
considered stricken. 
</P>
<P>
"No vessel is a relief vessel if it's dead in the water," the wharfinger said. 
"(Keegan's) been treated very generously by the port, but we have our 
limitations."
