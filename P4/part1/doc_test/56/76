  [Text] Kiev -- By its resolution of 26 January 1994 the 
Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine introduced partial changes to 
the resolution of 15 January 1991 "On the procedure of issuing 
special permissions (licences) to carry out certain kinds of 
activity and on the amount of payments for the state 
registration of the subjects of entrepreneurship." New payment 
amounts have been set for citizens and legal entities -- 
subjects of entrepreneurial activity -- for the issue of 
licences by the Ministry of Transport to carry out agency 
services for the merchant marine port [as received] in the sea 
and river ports of Ukraine. In Odessa, Ilyichevsk, Kherson, 
Yuzhnoye, and Mariupol ports this is $800,000 per port; in the 
ports of Berdyansk, Nikolayev, Kherson, Izmail, and Reni this is 
$400,000; in Belgorod-Dunayskiy, Kiliya, Yalta, and in all river 
ports this is $200,000 per port. 
  The resolution stipulates that these payments are to be made 
in foreign currency (with the availability of the National Bank 
licence) or in Ukraine's currency converted according to the 
National Bank exchange rate at the time of issue. Besides, the 
principal marine agencies of the Ukrainian Ministry of Transport 
are exempt for five years from any payments for the issue of 
licenses to carry out agency services for the merchant marine 
fleet. The resolution also stipulates that 90 percent of the 
monies received for the issue of licenses are transferred to the 
currency account of the Ministry of Finance, if paid in foreign 
currency, and to the state budget, if paid in Ukraine's 
currency. The rest of the sum remains at the disposal of the 
Ministry of Transport.
