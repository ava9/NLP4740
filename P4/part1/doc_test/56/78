HKDollars 92m

CHINA'S willingness to experiment with new means of raising foreign capital
took another step forward yesterday when China Merchants, the large
shipping, industrial, finance and tourism concern owned by the Chinese
central government, went to the Hong Kong stock market seeking HKDollars
92m.
In the first such invitation of its kind, China Merchants is offering the
investing public a chance to buy into a mainland manufacturer of marine and
industrial paints. It will issue 61.25m shares in Hai Hong Holdings (25 per
cent of the company's capital) at HKDollars 1.50 a share.
At the issue launch yesterday, Mr Jiang Bo, China Merchants' managing
director, said that if the issue proved successful then the company would
consider using Hai Hong as a vehicle to float other China Merchants assets.
Mr Jiang also hinted at a possible listing in London for China Merchants'
Houlder Insurance Brokers (HIB). He said it had the 'financial conditions'
for listing and that there should be no problem with such a move. HIB was
acquired in 1987 and had revenues in 1990 of Pounds 11.4m (Dollars 21.09m).
The decision to float a subsidiary in Hong Kong is a significant development
for China Merchants, which is conservatively managed and secretive.
It also indicates a growing acceptance in Beijing for economic reform.
Analysts expected the issue to meet with widespread investor interest. The
issue had novelty value and investors have demonstrated their hunger to own
mainland assets, they said.
China Merchants is one of the 'four heavenly sisters' or old mainland
companies in Hong Kong. It is owned by the Ministry of Communications in
Beijing.
Mr Jiang said the float had been under consideration for the past year. He
said Hai Hong was chosen because it has a good track record and that the
outlook for the paints industry in China was bright. There were also few
difficulties in restating the company's accounts to conform to western
standards.
Advisers to the company said this float represented an experiment for China
Merchants. A relatively simple, single product company had been chosen for
the float.
They said, however, that Hai Hong would develop into China Merchants' listed
Hong Kong company. Much like Citic Pacific, the locally-listed vehicle for
Beijing's China International Trust and Investment Company, Hai Hong may
well end up owning stakes in China Merchants' extensive interests, they
added.
'They are just beginning to realise that you do not need to own 100 per cent
of something to control it,' said one adviser.
