physician or physician assistant that meets the requirements for originally obtaining the rating(s).

Except as provided in this paragraph, a merchant mariner's document may not be renewed more than 12 months after it
has expired. To obtain a reissuance of a merchant mariner's document expired more than 12 months, an applicant shall
comply with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section. When an applicant's merchant mariner's document expires
during a time of service with the Armed Forces and there is no reasonable opportunity for renewal, including by mail,
this 12-month period of grace may be extended. The period of military service following the date of merchant mariner's
document expiration which precluded renewal may be added to the 12 month period of grace. The 12 month period of grace,
and any extension, do not affect the expiration date of the document. A merchant mariner's document, and any endorsements
that it contains, are not valid for use after the expiration date.
