A Navy ship equipped to repair Marine Corps jets and helicopters slipped out of 
Port Hueneme on Tuesday, the first of three military vessels from Southern 
California to head to the Persian Gulf since the conflict began, a Navy 
spokeswoman confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Curtiss, with a crew of 41 civilian merchant seamen, departed from its home 
port Tuesday afternoon, said Marge Holtz, director of public affairs for the 
Navy's Military Sealift Command in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept it quiet," Holtz said. "The movements of ships are generally 
classified." 
</P>
<P>
Although the ship is berthed at the Naval Construction Battalion Center, Holtz 
said it did not depart with Seabees, the Navy's construction engineers and 
tradesmen. "There would be no reason for them to be aboard," she said. "It 
would be much easier to fly them to the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Curtiss, two huge military supply ships were scheduled to 
leave Los Angeles Harbor for the Persian Gulf at daybreak today, becoming the 
first to leave San Pedro on a voyage one anxious merchant seaman described as 
"a lot more dangerous than usual." 
</P>
<P>
Though Navy and Defense Department officials would not disclose the specific 
assignments of the vessels, Cape Ducato and Meteor, they did confirm Wednesday 
that they are slated to join the Navy's deployment in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Both vessels, cleaned and fueled in recent days at Terminal Island shipyards, 
will carry crews of about 40 merchant seamen. The ships reportedly will leave 
without military cargoes, scheduled instead to pick up equipment and supplies 
at one of several U.S. naval ports during their two- to three-week voyage to 
the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people wish they weren't going to a conflict like this," said Mark 
Kalmus, a 32-year-old merchant seaman assigned to the Cape Ducato. "Shipping 
has been slow, so everybody is glad to have a job," Kalmus said. "But this one 
could be a lot more dangerous than usual." 
</P>
<P>
Although these three ships are the first to be deployed from Southern 
California to the Middle East since the conflict began, three naval warships 
based in Long Beach and carrying about 900 sailors were already on duty in the 
region, said Lt. Cmdr. Steve Chesser, a Navy spokesman in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Curtiss is initially headed for the Arabian Sea at the mouth of the Persian 
Gulf, Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
The Curtiss is one of two ships deployed this week by the Navy's Military 
Sealift Command designed to repair Marine Corps aircraft damaged in the 
military's Operation Desert Shield. President Bush deployed U.S. forces to the 
Middle East after Iraq invaded its neighbor Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The Curtiss' sister ship, the Wright, departed from its home port in 
Philadelphia earlier this week, Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
The Curtiss, which measures 602 feet by 90 feet, is a floating repair shop 
outfitted with cranes and spare parts for Marine Corps aircraft. The ship is 
capable of holding 300 troops, but Holtz said it departed without any. "She is 
carrying a tremendous amount of supplies for the Marine Corps," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Curtiss is the only active-duty ship berthed at the deep-water harbor at 
Port Hueneme. The other Navy vessels docked in the harbor are retired World War 
II-vintage destroyers used for target practice by Navy jets. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the two Seabee units based at Port Hueneme were placed on alert and 
began preparing for the possibility of being dispatched to the Middle East to 
build facilities for U.S. forces deployed in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Cmdr. Gene Okamoto of the Pacific Missile Test Center at Point Mugu said he 
had not heard of Navy aircraft transporting Seabees. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not been flying out Seabees either," said Col. Anthony Volante of the 
Channel Islands Air National Guard Base, which maintains a squadron of 
transport planes at Point Mugu.
