THE MARRIED MAN: A LIFE OF DH LAWRENCE by Brenda Maddox Sinclair-Stevenson
Pounds 20, 631 pages
FRIEDA LAWRENCE by Rosie Jackson Pandora Pounds 14.99, 240 pages
Lady Ida Sitwell describes a Chiantishire luncheon to her son Osbert in
1926: 'A Mr DH Lawrence came over the other day, a funny little petit-maitre
of a man with flat features and a beard. He is a writer, and seems to know
of you. His wife is a large German . . .'
Lawrence would be dead within four years, Frieda in 30. It was - though Lady
Ida would never know - one of the most extraordinary and extravagant
marriages in the history of literature. Brenda Maddox has written a most
readable account, not so much of Lawrence as of his marriage - 'a mismatch
made in heaven', as she puts it.
She starts from her response to 'a likeable Lawrence: a devastating mimic,
an inspired teacher, a handy householder, a hard-working journalist, a loyal
brother and generous uncle, a good cook, an eager traveller and brilliant
travel writer, a dogged, dreadful painter, an ecological visionary and,
above all - as he saw himself - a married man'.
That said, she does not ignore the rest of the portrait: the appalling
tensions within the marriage, the alarming anti-democratic political
instincts, the sexual problems which were evaded with sodomy, the cruel
selfishness which denied Frieda her children. 'Lawrence's real vices were
ambivalence, grandiloquence and irascibility' says Maddox, and later, in
compensation, quotes Edward Garnett on the man's 'lovableness, cheekiness,
intensity and pride'.
Unlike the host of earlier books about Lawrence, this one is extremely brisk
about the childhood; even Jessie Chambers scarcely figures. After Lawrence's
euthanasia-killing of his beloved mother, the focus is on Frieda Weekley.
Born a Von Richthoven, she was a member of a liberated and intellectual
German family - Maddox is good on pre-war Munich where Frieda's most
influential lover, Otto Gross, was a disciple of Freud and a morphine
addict.
Frieda, after 13 years in a boring Nottingham marriage, did not hesitate to
appoint herself the 27-year-old writer's erotic muse, a role which, with the
exception of the war years, would keep them out of Britain: 'In their
contempt for the stupefying hypocrisy of England, with its concern for
appearances and its deep shame about the body, they were as one, and in
their odd alliance they were refusing to collaborate in it any longer'.
This is a literary biography which does not make the common mistake of
under-esteeming the literature (Maddox is interesting, for instance, on St
Mawr, and on the curious parallels between a Lawrence story The Shadow in
the Rose Garden and Joyce's earlier The Dead), but a book about a marriage
has to tackle the detail of that relationship. It was, we are assured, a
sexually ill-matched association: 'Anal sex seems to have been the
Lawrences' resolution to the conflict between them'.
Then there was the matter of Lawrence's possible homosexual leanings -
'Lawrence was not like Forster, a suppressed homosexual who did not have the
courage of his desires . . . He was a hypersensitive man unable to bring
together the male and female components of his personality, and in the grip
of a terror of losing the boundaries of self'. There may have been one
homosexual episode in 1917 with a farmer friend, just as there was one known
adultery, with Rosalind Baynes; after that there would be impotence - guess
who was the model for Sir Clifford Chatterley]
None of which damages Lawrence's importance to all of us. 'My great religion
is a belief in the blood, the flesh, as being wiser than the intellect. We
can go wrong in our minds. But what our blood feels and believes and says,
is always true', wrote Lawrence in a famous - notorious - remark. We can
deny it, we can be rude about him and, if we wish, his fat German wife, but
we cannot pretend to be beyond his influence.
There is of course much else of interest and value in this long,
deeply-researched history. New Mexico, Mexico, Australia (Kangaroo as 'the
most under-appreciated and biographically provocative of any of his
novels'), the supreme travel writing (Sea and Sardinia after an eight-day
visit]), Lady Chatterley ('God forbid that I should be taken as urging loose
sex activity' wrote Lawrence to Lady Ottoline Morrell - too late, of
course).
My only regret is that we do not have more letters, which Maddox rightly
explains is what makes her like him. Consider, for instance, a 1922 letter
to Forster, not mentioned here - 'I think you made a nearly deadly mistake
in glorifying those business people in Howards End. Business is no good'.
Isn't that the best ever comment on Mr Wilcox?
Rosie Jackson's Frieda Lawrence, with the same jacket photograph as the
Maddox, is misleading. It turns out to be a hundred pages in defence of
Frieda - answering in particular the tittle-tattle about Frieda's
promiscuity and pointing out that she spent only 18 of her 77 years with
Lawrence - and a reprint of Frieda's own autobiography, Not I, But The Wind,
which dates from 1935 and is economic with some of the actualite, yet has
its own compulsion. A rather odd volume, but valuable to addicts.
