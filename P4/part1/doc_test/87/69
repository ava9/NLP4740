has a diverting evening in Scarborough

DURING the two and a half hours Love Off The Shelf is on stage at
Scarborough, Yorkshire, the queen bee of romance fiction, Dame Barbara
Cartland, will have added two dozen pages to her oeuvre. This musical at
Stephen Joseph Theatre is directed by Alan Ayckbourn and is a thoroughly
enjoyable tilt at the romantic fiction industry.
The writers Roger Hall (book), AK Grant (lyrics) and Philip Norman (music)
base their idea on the cliches lurking in publishers' tips on how to write
romance novels. Everything becomes subject to parody, which is why Love Off
The Shelf will never be a great musical, since the action is unsure where to
take itself. But this makes a good diverting evening which amounts to an
extended revue rather than the full musical works.
The action meanders between City of Angels, The Singing Detective and
Possession. Two tweedy academics are researching the dull, short life of a
poet who wrote little and is known even less - the professional's dream
project. But both are secretly writing romance novels to strict rules. Hers
is a steamy Caribbean rhumba about the fortunes of one Clare Truelove and
the 'sardonically sneering' Hamilton Squire. And his is a raunchy (the
publishers call this 'Super Desire') Irish romp involving mega-novelist Sean
O'Hara and secretary Kathleen: 'Oh, Mister O'Hara, I've read all your books'
 -'Yes, but did you buy them?' The parallel interests evolve into happy
endings, but leave the romance species looking pretty weak.
The play peddles in types. The romance hero has been dark and mysterious
ever since Byron put the 'roam' into Romantic with his infidelities; and the
heroine supine since Jane Austen's action adventure Persuasion where eyes
meet across the Octagon Room in Bath Spa and a young lady's flirtation at
Lyme Regis ends in tears and concussion. But at Scarborough the action
flirts with sex stereotypes: behind the chiselled features and black-flecked
eyes of the hero is a sensitive man; and amidst the heroine's storm of
electrical feelings and racing pulses is a shrewd, savvy woman.
The songs are unmemorable, not because they are poor, but because they
underachieve. Parodies like these push their targets to one side, but never
out of sight; so the attention they get is always divided. But the acting
and singing are energetic and witty (particularly Simon Day and Sara
Markland), if overdone at times for such a small theatre. There is a strong
chorus to open and close the second half, and a deft number from the
researchers, 'What Can it Be Like?' . . . to be famous and feted.
Ayckbourn's sure and vivid staging work with Sheila Carter's sharp
choreography to bring the tunes to life and bring onto the small revolving
stage a ski-run, a ship, a helicopter, a lighthouse, a cliff and a sequence
of diminishing palm trees to represent the departing shore; as Sam Goldwyn
used to say from ship to pier, 'Bon voyage.'
The Stephen Joseph Theatre leaves its present site after its lease expires
next season, and will move into Scarborough's former Odeon Cinema. Half the
Pounds 4.35m needed has been raised; it should be supported.
In repertory, Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough, Yorkshire (0723 370541)
until November 20
