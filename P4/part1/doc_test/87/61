SONS AND LOVERS by D H Lawrence, edited by Helen Baron and Carl Baron
Cambridge Pounds 70, 675 pages
SONS and Lovers was published on May 29 1913 by Gerald Duckworth and was the
novel that established D H Lawrence as a writer of importance. But the text
that has been in general use for the past 79 years is not the one that
Lawrence, had he lived in an ideal world, would have wished to stand as the
true text of his novel - or so the editors of this new edition tell us.
Helen and Carl Baron have scrutinised the manuscripts of the earlier drafts
(where the novel is titled Paul Morel) and the original sets of proofs
corrected by Lawrence and have produced a text as close as possible to the
one that they believe Lawrence would have preferred to have seen in use.
That, as they realise, is a hypothetical criterion. If Lawrence could return
from the dead to read the book under review he might conceivably have second
thoughts and wish to continue to leave out material they have put back.
There is, for example, the parallel case of T S Eliot, whose Waste Land
first appeared in a text that had been drastically cut from the original
version by Ezra Pound. The poet gratefully accepted these cuts as an
improvement of his work and they have remained in force ever since. The
first printed version of The Waste Land has not been superseded, even though
the earlier and much longer uncut version was made available to the public
after Eliot's death.
But there is good reason to believe that, unlike Eliot, Lawrence was not at
all happy about the cuts made by Edward Garnett for that first edition of
Sons and Lovers and that he only agreed to them out of expediency. He
desperately needed at this crisis point in his life - when he had turned his
back on Eastwood and England and had gone to Germany with Frieda - to get
his novel published, both for the sake of his reputation and to earn some
urgently required cash. For his later books he would break free of Garnett's
editorial yoke and would in most instances refuse to compromise on points of
emendation and cuts requested by publishers.
The changes imposed by Garnett come under two main heads: those made in
deference to Mrs Grundy, and those made to give greater unity (in Garnett's
eyes) to the ultimate shape of the novel. Mrs Grundy was a fictional Mary
Whitehouse who emerged at the end of the 18th century and whose abhorrence
of any hint of explicit eroticism in the text of a novel acted as a
tyrannical restraint upon publishers and hence upon novelists, particularly
in the late Victorian period.
Mrs Grundy's views were rigorously upheld by the circulating libraries which
were the chief commercial outlet for fiction-publishing in the UK until the
1930s. Many of the leading male late Victorian English novelists suffered
grievously from Mrs Grundy. She was, for example, an important cause of
Hardy giving up novel-writing. George Moore publicly took issue with her in
his pamphlet Literature at Nurse, attacking her strictures while he defied
them in novels like A Modern Lover. But it was left to Lawrence and Joyce to
rout her totally.
The editors of this new edition give several examples of the kind of changes
Garnett made in his Grundyite capacity. One example will suffice. In the
chapter 'Passion', Lawrence originally wrote: 'He bent forward and kissed
the two white glistening globes she cradled.' This sentence has appeared
hitherto as: 'He bent forward and kissed her, held her suddenly close and
kissed her again'. It is good now in this edition to have the truly
Lawrentian passage restored and this applies at many other points in the
story.
The question of unity is more controversial. The editors point out that
Garnett, schooled in the mainstream tradition of the English novel,
conceived of unity as a narrative that subordinated everything to tracing
the fortunes of an eponymous hero or heroine. They also point out that
Lawrence finally called his novel Sons plural and Lovers and that its unity
comes from its detailed depiction of one family, a group of remarkably
well-defined individuals, their interaction with each other and with those
people outside who threaten the mother-dominated family's solidarity. The
novel is, in spite of the earlier title, a novel about a family-group, its
survival and ultimate break-up, not just a novel about Paul Morel,
Lawrence's fictional alter ego.
Thus William, Paul's older brother, competes for the reader's attention in
the opening until his untimely demise - so harrowingly described in the
chapter called 'A Death in the Family'. Mrs Morel's reaction to William's
betrothal to the vacuous Lily, who gives herself such airs when she comes to
stay with them, foreshadows Mrs Morel's attitude to Paul in his relations
with Miriam. Garnett, keen to get on with the narrative, cut some passages
relating to Will.
A comparison between the two versions suggests that in the event Garnett was
quite skilful and that nothing of really crucial importance was lost. The
character of upwardly mobile Will, the first family member to rise within
the system, renounce the pits as a bread-ticket, integrate himself into the
metropolitan middle-class and make a disastrous liaison with a woman quite
unsuited to him, has always been a distinct part of the whole picture. Here
again it is good to have precious sentences and touches, making it even
fuller rehabilitated.
Even if we do not feel that the novel emerges in quite such a radically
altered form as the editors imply, we can all be grateful for the appearance
of this much more authentic text. The explanatory notes contain a wealth of
information on everything from local Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire dialects
to music hall songs, Biblical, classical and French literature, illuminating
Lawrence's more obscure references. An Appendix reprints the Foreword to the
novel Lawrence wrote in Italy in 1913 (not actually printed until 1932).
There are also maps of the district in which the novel is set and a complete
account of variant readings in the manuscripts. In other words, the Barons
have done a highly professional job and the new text they have established
here will be the one that all readers and students of D H Lawrence will need
to use from now on.
Before eyebrows go up at the price of this book, let me end by saying that
there is also a 'trade' edition containing the newly-edited text of Sons and
Lovers at Pounds 14.95. This is some 200 pages shorter than the one at
Pounds 70 and lacks the editors' introduction and all the critical
apparatus.
