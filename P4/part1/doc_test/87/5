THE BOYS: A BIOGRAPHY OF MICHEAL MACLIAMMOIR AND HILTON EDWARDS
by Christopher Fitz-Simon
Nick Hern Books Pounds 17.99, 320 pages
The Boys succeeded Lady Gregory and Yeats as the custodians of the Irish
genius for theatre but neither Hilton Edwards nor Micheal MacLammoir was
Irish. The story of these partners in every sense of the word for over 50
years, and the company they kept going in spite of chronic financial crisis,
was well worth telling in detail. In this book Christopher Fitz-Simon, an
Irish theatre director, who was for some years artistic director of the
Abbey Theatre, gives most thoroughly the history of the great rival to the
Abbey, the Gate Theatre.
Dublin in the late 1920s, when the Gate began, was a very closed society.
The Abbey - founded in 1904 - was still in the iron grip of the formidable
Lady Gregory. Dennis Johnston, a Dublin lawyer of Ulster Protestant
ancestry, sent the Abbey an expressionist play he had written about Robert
Emmet. It came smartly back to him, rejected. As he opened the envelope he
noticed that someone had inscribed in pencil on the back 'The old lady says
'No']'. It was under that title that the play was eventually put on in 1929
at the newly formed Gate Theatre in Dublin, directed by Hilton Edwards with
Micheal MacLammoir, as the Speaker (Emmet), and it gave them their first
sensational success with a new play.
The Boys were variously gifted. Both frequently appeared on stage,
MacLammoir, in major parts. London recognised his consummate acting when he
appeared in Hedda Gabler with Peggy Ashcroft in 1954.
MacLammoir, also wrote plays for the company and was a talented painter
designing several of their productions. Edwards, while wheeling and dealing
as the company's paternalistic artistic director and administrator, directed
the majority of their productions himself.
The Boys were both Londoners. Bobby Edwards was brought up in East Finchley,
son of an Indian civil servant. As a young man he had minor parts at the Old
Vic and was one of Ronald Frankau's Cabaret Kittens. Micheal MacLammoir, was
born Alfred Willmore. Aged 12 he played the young MacDuff in Beerbohm-Tree's
Macbeth and also appeared as a lost boy in Peter Pan the year Noel Coward
played Slightly. The manner in which he learnt to speak Irish, gave himself
a Celtic name and completely reconstructed his identity, claiming to have
been born in Cork, is material for a wonderful play he never wrote. But
someone should.
I once met Micheal MacLammoir, after I had been to see the Gate's production
in Dublin of St Joan with Siobhan MacKenna and I sampled his irresistible
charm. He had played the Earl of Warwick, now he entertained both me and
members of the company, with hilarious imitations of all the St Joans he had
seen from a stentorian Sybil Thorndike to a tiny squeaky Ludmilla Pitoeff.
Both he and Edwards learnt their job the hard way. They met as members of
the touring company run by the legendary Anew McMaster (later Pinter's
mentor). Orson Welles crops up at the Gate as a young hopeful aged 16, and
then years later as director of the film Othello in which Micheal
MacLammoir, played Iago (see his Put Money in Thy Purse). James Mason played
Brutus there and there were appearances by Cyril Cusack, Jimmy O'Dea, Brian
Friel (as one of their playwrights) and Eamonn Andrews.
The stormy relations between the Boys and the Earl of Longford - older
brother of the present one - are traced. Longford initially subsidised the
theatre entirely out of his own pocket and was on its board of directors,
but then formed his own company. The premises were shared, each company
occupying the theatre building for six consecutive months - an unhappy
arrangement that remained for many years.
The story has a happy ending, financially, with the Gate receiving, under
Charles Haughey's premiership in 1969, a government grant. Micheal
MacLammoir, made his own fortune with the international success of his one
man show about Oscar Wilde, and Hilton became first Head of Drama for Irish
television. But money was never really important to either of them except as
a means of furthering the work at the Gate. The only tiny mistakes I could
discover in this most interesting book were: Barrie was not a bachelor and
the Oxford bookshop is called Blackwell's.
Nick Hern, publisher of this book, was the editor at Methuen responsible for
their series of modern play texts that included the plays of Simon Gray,
John Mortimer, Michael Frayn, Edward Bond, Harold Pinter. He did not start
the series - that was the achievement of the late John Cullen way back in
the 1960s - but he greatly developed it. Then when Methuen was taken over in
1988, Hern broke away to start his own list. Several of the playwrights,
including Pinter, also left Methuen around that time; but they migrated to
Faber who in the late 1980s took over as our main publisher of play texts
for the ordinary reader.
Meanwhile Hern has kept his own imprint as a specialist publisher of
theatrical books and operates now from 14 Larden Road, London W3 7ST under
the logo - NHB. This year he says 'marks the emergence into full
independence of Nick Hern Books, the imprint I founded to publish all that's
best in the current theatre - and a few other things besides'.
Hern has formed an alliance with the Royal National Theatre and has
published Tony Kushner's Angels in America: Millennium Approaches and
Perestroika (the Aids epic currently playing to packed houses at the
Cottesloe). Hern and the NT have also recently published, or rather
re-published, 12 volumes of Granville Barker's Prefaces to Shakespeare at
Pounds 4.99 each. Richard Eyre says in a foreword that he regards Granville
Barker 'not only as the first modern English director but as the most
influential'. Barker's comments on Shakespeare remain relevant today.
