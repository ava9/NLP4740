THE COLLECTED LETTERS OF WB YEATS: VOL. III 1901-1904 edited by John Kelly
and Ronald Scuchard Oxford Pounds 35, 760 pages
If Yeats is anyone to go by, great poets are not always great spellers:
'Dear Lady Gregory: A great many thanks for the wine &amp; the other things  -
all things I am very glad of. I am eating one of the biskets, now while I am
writing, eating it with my coffey. I send you a new press cutting which
belongs I suppose to the theatre book. I cannot find the slip of paper on
which I wrote Sharps referance for Deirdre Children so I have asked him to
give me the referance again.'
That was in December 1901 when Yeats, a bachelor aged 36, lived in London
where he was a tireless worker on behalf of the Irish Literary Theatre
(which became the Abbey Theatre), having earlier published his book on The
Celtic Twilight. Here he is suggesting to Lady Gregory that in her
compilation of Irish folk legends she recounts what happened to Deirdre's
children after their mother's death.
Deirdre - torn between two ferocious men - became in the writings of Lady
Gregory, Yeats, Synge and Russell an emblem of Ireland's destiny. Deirdre
was also re-worked by William Sharp, a Scot who had jumped onto the Celtic
Twilight bandwaggon as the female poet 'Fiona Macleod'. In this guise he
sent Yeats a copy of From the Hills of Dream. Yeats, fully aware of the
author's real identity, replied: 'My dear Miss Macleod, I have been a long
while about thanking you for your book of poems, but have been shifting from
Dublin to London and very busy about various things - too busy for any quiet
reading.'
Sharp is but one of dozens of now forgotten figures who crowd in on Yeats's
early letters. Yeats wrote to anyone whom he thought might further the cause
of Irish Renaissance, especially people prominent in the theatre -
actor-managers like Frank Benson and Mrs Patrick Campbell, who toyed with
the idea of performing the Countess Cathleen but nothing came of it.
Maybe she was put off by Yeats's insistence at this period that his poetry
should be enhanced by chanting and accompanied by the twanging of a
psaltery. Letters to Arnold Dolmetsch, the early music expert, contain
arrangements for tuition in this instrument. Yeats also undergoes
instruction as a member of the Golden Dawn, an occult society, whose members
had to submit to strenuous examination and were graded according to their
mystical attainments.
Other correspondents who have stood the test of time better are Bernard
Shaw, whom the Irish theatre originally rejected but then tried to rope in
with a performance of The Devil's Disciple; and the Fay brothers, who took
over the administration of the theatre when it became established. There
were constant squabbles over policy. Letters to the young Joyce show Yeats
offering advice and practical help when Joyce came to London, although Joyce
had poured scorn on the theatre when he was still in Dublin. George Moore
also appears as an early supporter and then a dissenter.
Not all of Yeats's heroines at this time came out of Celtic mythology. There
was the flesh and blood Maud Gonne who fiercely espoused the cause of Irish
independence though she was not by origin Irish, being the daughter of a
London-born captain in the British army. Yeats had met her in 1899 and fell
under the spell of this strong, beautiful woman who was a confirmed
militant; 'the troubling of my life began', he said of her impact on him. In
this volume she goes on stage and acts the role of Cathleen ni Houlihan in
Yeats's play of that name in 1902; and in the following year she marries
Major John MacBride, who had led the Irish brigade in South Africa on the
side of the Boers.
By then she had already had two children by a French lover. Yeats was
ignorant of them, but was devastated by her marriage. 'I feal (sic) somehow'
Yeats writes to Lady Gregory in 1903 'that the Maud Gonne I have known so
long has passed away.' It was true; but after her legal separation from her
husband in 1905, Yeats resumed relations with her. There is good reason to
believe they did later become lovers. By the end they were at odds again
when Yeats became a Senator and she became a member of the IRA. In 1922 her
house in Dublin was raided by the Black and Tans. All her papers were
destroyed including her letters from Yeats.
Those letters are missing links in this otherwise wonderfully complete
edition. The volume traces Yeats's emergence from the melancholy Celtic mist
to his belief in the power of will, leading to those attitudes to literature
and modern Irish history that were to flower so splendidly in his later
poems. The editors have fulfilled the task of providing a footnote for every
recipient and obscure reference superbly which renders the volume slow
reading, but it should delight all Yeats admirers.
