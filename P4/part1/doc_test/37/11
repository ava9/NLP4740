<TEXT>
<P>
George Hamilton, who hasn't had a role in a feature film since 1981, almost 
didn't end up in "The Godfather, Part III." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, 51, plays a WASP lawyer who sets up a deal for the Corleone family 
with the Vatican Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said in the January issue of Vanity Fair that his agent at first 
turned down the role because he had been told it would be a cameo. 
</P>
<P>
"You did what?" he recalled telling his agent. "We're talking about 'The 
Godfather' here." 
</P>
<P>
Finally Hamilton called director Francis Ford Coppola in Italy, and Coppola 
assured him that he still wanted the actor. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Francis, you're telling me that you will work with me to make it 
good. That's all I need.' And I jumped on a plane and went to Rome," Hamilton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It was his first role since "Zorro, the Gay Blade" in 1981. Hamilton's other 
movie credits include "Love at First Bite" and "Where the Boys Are."
