<P>
Andrea Stava, pretty in pink from hair bow to party shoes, leaned against her 
mommy's knees as she waited in the crowd. She seemed awfully calm considering 
she had waited all her life for this moment. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the 6-year-old was too young to grasp the full import of the occasion. It 
wasn't lost on her mother. "I waited 28 years!" Debbie Stava exclaimed. "When 
we got the tickets I went bonkers for Bozo!" 
</P>
<P>
Waiting for Bozo is as quintessentially Chicago as deep dish pizza or the Cubs' 
Bleacher Bums. Tickets for "The Bozo Show," the longest running children's 
program on television, are so much in demand that parents order them before 
their children are born. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Vanau ordered eight tickets while pregnant with her first child. Nine 
years and five kids later, she finally got the word that her time had come. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Watson and her husband received four Bozo tickets from a neighbor when 
they were married. "It was a great wedding present," Watson recalls. "I 
remember thinking: 'Gee, what will we be doing in 10 yea" 
</P>
<P>
The reservation list for the show became so unmanageable that it was frozen 10 
years ago at 200,000 names. WGN-TV, the Chicago based superstation that 
produces Bozo five days a week, 155 shows a year, recently got down to the 
final few names. It briefly opened a special telephone number a few weeks ago 
to take ticket requests for the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois Bell logged about 27 million attempts in Illinois alone. And since the 
program is also carried on cable systems throughout the United States and parts 
of Central and South America, ticket requests poured in from thousands of miles 
away as well. 
</P>
<P>
The 140,000 tickets were snatched up in 5 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Ursin, a Los Angeles resident who grew up in Chicago, ordered four 
tickets even though she has no children. "My sister has a newborn and wanted 
them so badly that I made an extra effort to call," she says. Ursin plans to 
come to Chicago for "The Bozo Show" and will bring "my sister, her child and 
maybe if I have one in five years. . . . I don't anticipate seeing the tickets 
for several years." 
</P>
<P>
Bozo has been around for more than half a century and has even entered the 
lexicon as a slang term for a "fool." The character was created for children's 
records, but made its way onto the television screen when Larry Harmon, the Los 
Angeles actor who was the voice of Bozo, bought the rights to the clown in 
1954. 
</P>
<P>
He franchised the character to more than 80 local stations across the country, 
including one in Washington, D.C., where Willard Scott, now the weatherman on 
"The Today Show," played the clown. Today, only a few locally produced Bozo 
shows remain, but none come close to the success of the Chicago version. 
</P>
<P>
"This, by local standards, is a large production," said producer Allen Hall, 
who has been with the show since it premiered here in 1961. "Most stations 
can't afford to do this kind of thing." The show's prop cage has floors of 
costumes, laugh-getters like a real 15-gallon hat and shelves chock full of 
rubber chickens, turkeys, salamis and a host of other unedible edibles. 
</P>
<P>
Cavorting with Bozo under the yellow, red and blue studio big top is Cooky, a 
round, naive clown who is often the target of the season's 15 to 20 cases worth 
of shaving cream pies and Wizzo, a magician decked out in Arabian garb. And 
there is Professor Andy, the show's spike-haired musician, a preteen heartthrob 
who regularly gets perfumed love letters from young fans. 
</P>
<P>
Lessons in morality lose out to pratfalls and banana peels. Nevertheless, Hall 
likens Bozo to Mr. Rogers, the popular children's TV host, in that both 
communicate with kids. "They're like members of the family. The kids feel like 
they're watching friends." 
</P>
<P>
Festooned in his thick stage makeup and bright orange wig, Bozo (actor Joey 
D'Auria) agreed. "You get little kids, little tiny ones, and they say 'I love 
you Bozo,' " the 38-year-old one-time stand-up comic said before a recent 
taping. "That makes you melt." 
</P>
<P>
Before Bozo, D'Auria performed in Los Angeles comedy clubs. As Dr. Flameo, he 
screamed in key as he placed his hand over various sized candles. His act won 
on "The Gong Show" and gained the attention of Johnny Carson's bookers. D'Auria 
sent a copy of his appearance on the talk show to WGN-TV when Bob Bell, the 
original Chicago Bozo, retired in 1984. The rest is history. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the best job in the whole world," Bozo/D'Auria squealed. "I get to make 
people happy and I love doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Although each program is taped a week in advance of its air date, editing is 
considered taboo. Even the plea from a boy who once whispered: "I gotta go to 
the bathroom" into Bozo's hidden microphone was aired. 
</P>
<P>
Skits are spiced with sight gags: One clown hitting the other with a 6-foot 
sponge mallet. And there are the old jokes: Bozo's brother is getting married 
to a two-headed lady. Asks Cooky: "Is she pretty?" Answers Bozo: "Well, yes and 
no." 
</P>
<P>
Everybody's favorite feature is the Grand Prize Game when a boy and a girl are 
randomly selected to toss Ping-Pong balls into six buckets, each a bit farther 
away than the last. Parents fondly recall practicing at home when they were 
only knee high. Children anxiously await a chance to win a bicycle and $100. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Stava was lucky enough to win the chance to play the Grand Prize Game. 
Her arm wasn't strong enough to get past the third bucket but she still took 
home a bounty of gifts, and got a big hug from Bozo. What did she like best? 
"Everything," she said. "I like everything!"
