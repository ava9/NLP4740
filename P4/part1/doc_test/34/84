With a headset cradling his ears and a mike at his lips, former baseball star 
Steve Garvey stepped up to the plate of talk radio before dawn Monday and, when 
he emerged 3 1/2 hours later, not a hair on his gleaming chestnut head appeared 
out of place. For that matter, barely an emotion or an opinion seemed ruffled 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey, who has had his share of controversy in recent months involving charges 
of two out-of-wedlock paternities, sounded about as smooth and seamless as he 
looked in a fresh white shirt and red tie speckled with figures of tennis 
players. The 40-year-old celebrity, who has been hired to woo the baby-boom 
audience to XTRA-AM by hosting a weekday talk show from 5:30 to 9 a.m., was 
aided by a bevy of friendly, prearranged call-in guests, including Los Angeles 
Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda, who called him "a wonderful person." 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't doing anything at that hour of the morning anyway," Garvey said at 
one point of his early-to-bed, early-to-rise regimen. "It gets your energy 
level up." 
</P>
<P>
If Garvey's voice was low and perhaps a bit tired as he launched "XTRA Morning 
Update with Garvey and Co." at 5:30, within the hour he sounded peppy as he did 
the lead-in for news updates about embattled Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose 
and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's latest "haunting problem with Chappaquiddick." 
(The jury foreman from the 20-year-old case was quoted in Newsweek as saying 
"there was a cover-up" to save Kennedy's political career.) 
</P>
<P>
Garvey, who retired from baseball before the 1988 season after an 18-year 
career as a first baseman with the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego 
Padres, said after his first XTRA show that he had "always thought politics 
would be four to six years down the road" once he finished playing baseball, 
and that that ambition still holds. He has expressed interest in seeking the 
Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat. Garvey is also founder and 
chairman of Garvey Marketing Group, a La Jolla-based sports marketing firm. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this would just be a nice forum for me to express my views and to 
share insights and knowledge," he said of the radio show. ". . . Gosh, this is 
the chance every day for me to start my day with a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
He said the format of the show would be split "60/40" between sports and 
entertainment interviews, and noted that he would like to do on-air profiles of 
"the Kevin Costners, the Emma Samms and the Jane Seymours." 
</P>
<P>
On his first day out, it was mostly baseball and sports that he talked about, 
giving equal time to Lasorda and Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn. But Garvey 
expressed few of his own opinions. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking with XTRA sports director Lee Hamilton, for example, who said he 
believes Rose "damaged himself at the gambling tables of America" and compared 
Rose's alleged gambling activities to the Chicago White Sox scandals of 1919, 
Garvey limited himself to asking questions. At one point he asked about the 
value of taking the testimony of "convicted felons" against Rose. But at 
another he noted "how important it is to keep the game clean." And when Lasorda 
had talked about the Reds fans mounting banners at their stadium in support of 
Rose, Garvey simply listened. 
</P>
<P>
When an interviewer later mentioned that it was hard to tell what he really 
felt, Garvey said with a broad grin, "Oh, good," explaining that he intended to 
offer his opinions only when asked. 
</P>
<P>
Off the air, he did just that. Garvey said that if Rose bet on baseball, he 
should be suspended "for a year," but if he bet on his team, he should be 
"banned for a lifetime." He added that there "should be due process." 
</P>
<P>
Garvey also disclosed off the air, in response to a question, that he is the 
father of a San Diego woman's 4-month-old daughter, which had been one of the 
two paternity charges against him. He said he is providing for the child. 
Garvey has two adolescent daughters from his marriage to Cyndy Garvey. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment about an alleged paternity involving the pregnancy of an 
Atlanta television editor to whom he had been engaged. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, Garvey married interior decorator Candace Thomas, who has 
two daughters from a former marriage. A black Mercedes station wagon, bearing 
plates "Th Garvs," sat at the front of the radio station's building. 
</P>
<P>
If sports was the dominant theme -- including in-studio guest Scott Hamilton, 
an Olympic gold medalist in ice-skating -- Garvey's personal life clearly was 
the program's sub-text. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to Tom Brookshire, a former pro-football player with the Philadelphia 
Eagles and now a sportscaster for all-sports radio station WIP in Philadelphia, 
Garvey said matter-of-factly that "the press takes off on, they take advantage 
of people like us who are straightforward and honest." 
</P>
<P>
A pre-taped interview with Bob Hope had an edge of innuendo as Hope noted, 
speaking of massages, that he has "a masseur here (Burbank), a masseur in Palm 
Springs and a masseur on the way." Garvey, later acknowledging the innuendo 
with a nod, insisted he did not mind. 
</P>
<P>
He seemed a bit uncomfortable on the air when a caller identified as John from 
Newport Beach said he was on Garvey's side in his personal battles. "I know 
this is going to strike a chord," John began, then compared Garvey's situation 
to that of Boston Red Sox third baseman Wade Boggs, who is being sued for 
palimony by his former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
John said press reports about Garvey's personal problems are "entirely unfair" 
when an athlete's "performance on the field" is "exemplary." But then John 
added that he didn't know how to treat Garvey, considering that Garvey has now 
become part of the media himself. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, I can go both ways," Garvey responded dryly. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey's worst moments came toward the end of his morning. KFMB-TV morning host 
Jerry G. Bishop, whose interview with Garvey was simulcast on both XTRA and his 
own "Sun-Up San Diego" show, started with welcoming chit-chat, then threw a 
verbal curve ball. Saying it was time to get serious, Bishop asked how Garvey 
felt about all the attention to his personal life, including those jokes about 
Garvey that Hope delivered at the Oscar ceremonies in March. 
</P>
<P>
Rather adroitly, Garvey told Bishop that when Hope said to him, "You provided a 
lot of great material for me," he replied simply, "It's a pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
He added that after a while, "you got to keep perspective" and indicated that 
he has no problems with his listeners. "I love the public," Garvey said. 
</P>
<P>
The two hosts went back to talking about Garvey's program but Bishop had one 
more lick to go. "A belated happy Father's Day," Bishop said, signing off.
