FT  17 JAN 94 / Observer: Portillo plays the bard
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If only all John Major's ministers displayed the kind of erudition shown by
Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, in his speech last Friday
to the Conservative Way Forward President's annual dinner.
Portillo, earmarked by some Tories as favoured candidate eventually to
succeed Major, gave a rousing address on 'one of the greatest threats that
has ever confronted the British nation' - nothing less than 'national
cynicism'.
He recruited one of Shakespeare's least-performed plays, Troilus and
Cressida, in support of his thesis. The play, he said, 'explains how order
in society depends upon a series of relationships of respect and duty from
top to bottom.' He then lengthily quoted Ulysses' speech in Act I scene iii:
'When degree is shaked
Which is the ladder to all high designs,
The enterprise is sick. . .'
But if Portillo had read a little further, he would have discovered that
Ulysses ends by depicting a scene today's cabinet may find quite familiar:
'The general's disdain'd
By him one step below, he by the next,
The next by him beneath: so every step,
Exampled by the first pace that is sick
Of his superior, grows to an envious fever
Of pale and bloodless emulation.'
