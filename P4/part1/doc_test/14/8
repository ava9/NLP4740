<P>
After restoring some of NASA's credibility with a successful launch and 
deployment of the Ulysses sun probe, Discovery's crew tended to experiments 
today and beamed down a birthday greeting for one of the astronaut's wives. 
</P>
<P>
The men sang "Happy Birthday" to Kaye Akers, wife of astronaut Tom Akers. In 
lieu of a candle, they held up a reflective plastic stick used aboard the 
shuttle as a light source. 
</P>
<P>
Ulysses, meanwhile, raced across the solar system on its five-year roundabout 
journey to explore the sun's poles.
