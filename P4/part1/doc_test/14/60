Galileo's camera shutter snapped uncontrollably for five hours Saturday after 
the spacecraft zipped around Venus, but officials said it should not endanger 
the $1.35-billion, eight-year mission to Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory shut off the television camera 
while they diagnosed the problem, which apparently involved faulty software 
that made Galileo's computer send incorrect commands to the camera, mission 
director Neal Ausman said. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo cruised around Venus at about 10 p.m. PST Friday, coming three to four 
miles closer to the planet than the planned point of closest approach of 10,028 
miles above the surface, said mission science and design manager Bill O'Neil. 
</P>
<P>
The camera appeared undamaged, but its shutter opened and closed twice per 
minute for a total of 468 times over five hours, Ausman said. As planned, only 
16 pictures taken late Friday and early Saturday were stored on Galileo's tape 
recorder, Ausman said. 
</P>
<P>
The malfunction did not harm those pictures, and the 452 unwanted shutter 
snappings were "just like taking pictures with no film in the camera," project 
manager Dick Spehalski said during a Saturday news conference. 
</P>
<P>
However the problem threatened another five dozen photos the spacecraft was 
supposed to take during the coming week to make a time-lapse movie of Venus' 
cloud and wind patterns, said project scientist Torrence Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo was deployed from space shuttle Atlantis last Oct. 18 on a looping 
2.4-billion mile, six-year route that requires Venus and Earth to be used as 
gravity slingshots to hurl the spacecraft to Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
Once there, the spacecraft will deploy a probe to study Jupiter's atmosphere, 
then orbit the giant gas planet for at least two years.
