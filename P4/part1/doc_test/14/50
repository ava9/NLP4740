<TEXT>
<P>
Officials in the town where Alice Walker was born want to build a trail 
honoring the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of "The Color Purple." 
</P>
<P>
Walker, 46, is honored in Eatonton only with a street named for her and with 
books on display at the Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of The Color Purple Educational Fund Foundation, which helps needy 
students, want to create a trail passing Walker's birthplace, her mother's home 
and the cemetery where her father and other relatives are buried. 
</P>
<P>
Plans also call for erecting a monument in the courthouse square. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we had a museum," said City Councilman Ulysses Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Other works by Walker include "You Can't Keep a Good Woman Down," "I Love 
Myself When I'm Laughing" and "Meridian."
