  [Text] There are good prospects for Austria's export trade 
to the Southeast Asian threshold countries. Transportation 
Minister Viktor Klima, who visited Vietnam, Malaysia, and 
Indonesia, accompanied by a delegation of leading industrialists 
and business managers, describes the region as a promising 
growth market with very tough competition. 
  In order for Austrian exporters to be successful on these 
markets, the state should grant them the same competitive 
conditions their foreign competitors enjoy, said Klima in a 
report on his talks. 
  Specific projects worth approximately 5 billion schillings 
were negotiated, Klima told Austrian radio correspondents 
following his visit. Klima is expecting the talks to yield 
tangible results within the next two or three years. 
  There is particularly great interest in equipment for local 
infrastructure programs, such as special rails, rail production 
machinery, locomotives, and freight cars. 
  In Vietnam, a bilateral railroad cooperation program is in 
the offing, and in Malaysia, a relevant railroad agreement, 
including the Austrian Rail Engineering (ARE) company, was 
discussed. In addition, Klima said deliveries in the area of 
power plant engineering and sewage treatment were discussed. 
However, real successes require soft loans. Klima said he 
would discuss this in the government. 
  Austrian suppliers will also set up, step-by-step, local 
production facilities in Indonesia and Malaysia. 
  In Kuala Lumpur, the extension of the current air transport 
agreement with Malaysia and MAS was discussed. Detailed 
negotiations are scheduled to begin in the next few weeks. The 
talks will be aimed at offering Vienna Airport increasingly as a 
bridgehead for Far East air connections. At present, MAS 
supplies a Kuala Lumpur-Vienna service twice every week.
