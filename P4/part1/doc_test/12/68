Like sparks in bush grass, a row is once again smouldering between Malaysia
and Australia.
Late last year Malaysia reacted angrily when Mr Paul Keating, Australia's
prime minister, called Dr Mahathir Mohamad, his Malaysian counterpart, a
recalcitrant for his non-attendance at the Seattle meeting of Asia-Pacific
regional leaders. At one stage Australian trade and contracts in Malaysia
were under threat. The argument was settled only after some delicate
diplomacy.
Now a fresh row threatens to erupt over the activities of Malaysian logging
companies in the south Pacific.
At a meeting of south Pacific leaders in Australia earlier this month, Mr
Keating accused Malaysian, South Korean and Indonesian logging companies of
'ripping off' the island nations by paying too little for valuable timber
products.
'Unless the environmental piracy of foreign companies operating in the south
Pacific region is controlled, the future for the region will be bleak,' Mr
Keating said.
Malaysia, which has shown itself deeply sensitive to outside criticism,
particularly on environmental issues, accused Australia of interfering in
matters outside its control. 'What is the business of Australia to criticise
the presence of Malaysian or other foreign logging companies in the south
Pacific islands?' asked Mr Lim Keng Yaik, Malaysia's minister of primary
industries.
Mr Lim suggested that Australia was jealous of the success of Malaysian
companies in the region and was using half truths to 'jumble up
environmental facts'.
This week Dr Mahathir added his voice to the anti-Australian chorus. In a
thinly veiled attack on Australian policy, he questioned the motives behind
a ADollars 2m (Pounds 960,000) aid package for the Solomon Islands. This was
announced during the south Pacific forum, and was offered on condition that
the Solomon Islands' government banned logging activity on certain
government land. The logging was being conducted by Kumpulan Emas, the
Malaysian group.
Australia said the money was to prevent environmental piracy but Dr Mahathir
questioned whether the aid had anything to do with ecology.
'Unfortunately the activities of Asean (Association of South-East Asia
Nations) loggers to help the economy of many developing countries have
aroused resentment among some regional powers,' Dr Mahathir said. 'Suddenly
money is offered to these developing countries to persuade them to stop
Malaysian investors and investors from other countries.'
Malaysian logging companies, most of them tightly controlled family
businesses owned by Chinese Malaysians, have accumulated vast financial
resources from the timber trade. The east Malaysia state of Sarawak alone
accounts for 80 per cent of the world's unprocessed tropical timber exports.
But with environmental pressures forcing cutbacks on logging, the country's
timber conglomerates have been looking at opportunities elsewhere.
In Papua New Guinea one Malaysian company, the privately held Rimbunan Hijau
group, has logging concessions of nearly 2m hectares - an area more than 20
times the size of Singapore.
Indonesia's powerful timber companies have also recently begun teaming up
with Malaysian loggers to launch operations in PNG.
Government and environmental groups in PNG say the foreign timber companies
have accumulated too much power and are resisting official controls on the
industry, pointing to the fact that Malaysian companies now control more
than 60 per cent of PNG's log exports.
In the Solomon Islands, a Malaysian company - Silvania Products, owned by
Kumpulan Emas - had its logging licence suspended recently for breaching
environmental regulations. Last month a senior executive of one of
Malaysia's biggest conglomerates resigned after being accused of trying to
bribe a Solomon Islands minister in connection with a timber deal - a charge
the executive denies.
Australia, as so often in its relations with South-East Asia, is in a bind.
Mr Keating clearly feels he is justified in criticising the activities of
Malaysian and other companies, and there is strong pressure from the local
environmental lobby for him to take a more forceful line. Australia is a big
aid donor and significant trading partner with the South Pacific nations,
and hence has some influence.
But the country's trade policy is now so heavily committed to the
Asia-Pacific region that it has to tread carefully to ensure that export and
investment opportunities are not put at risk.
In Brisbane, Mr Keating was scrupulous about not criticising Malaysian
loggers in isolation and always mentioned Korean and Indonesian companies in
the same breath. 'Whoever these companies belong to, I think that they
should be encouraged to be good corporate citizens,' he said.
After the 'recalcitrant' row, Australian ministers have taken a low-key line
where Malaysia is concerned. For example, Australia and New Zealand, through
their joint Closer Economic Relations deal, are keen to join the Asean
Free-Trade Area (AFTA). When, earlier this year, Malaysia's foreign minister
suggested that new members or linkages would not be possible for at least a
decade, his Australian counterpart said soothingly that he believed Asean
ministers would see the benefits of bringing the two groups together. No
one, he added, underestimated the difficulties involved.
But whether Australia's careful approach will defuse the tension is
questionable. Dr Mahathir has expounded the idea of Malaysia Inc: that
government and business work as a team in furthering the nation's
development. As Mr Keating is learning, it also means that criticism of
Malaysian companies is criticism of the Malaysian government and Dr
Mahathir.
