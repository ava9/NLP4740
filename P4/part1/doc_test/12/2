<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Dispute Over Sipadan and Ligitan Islands </F>
Should Be Settled Cordially"] 
  [Text] The third meeting of the Malaysian-Indonesian Joint 
Commission for Bilateral Cooperation ended in Kuala Lumpur 
yesterday with the two sides agreeing that no development will 
be undertaken on the islands of Sipadan and Ligitan while talks 
are under way to seek a solution to the dispute. The two 
nations believe that the dispute over the islands should be 
settled immediately to prevent it from becoming a "thorn" that 
may undermine close bilateral relations. 
  Malaysia and Indonesia agree that there are no obstacles 
standing in the way of strengthening good relations and further 
expanding cooperation in any field. We are convinced that 
recriminations and heated arguments over international problems 
will not bring any benefit to either party, but would rather 
open the possibility of outsiders interfering in their internal 
affairs -- something which may complicate the situation. Of 
course, many parties are awaiting to take advantage of a rift in 
relations between Malaysia and Indonesia, which belong to one 
family. We are convinced that the strong solidarity of the 
Malaysian and Indonesian people and leaders cannot be easily 
overshadowed or eroded by self-interest or the interest of any 
party who does not understand the basis of the strong 
relationship, although the two nations are separated by the 
Straits of Malacca. Although the brotherly relationship was 
once undermined by a confrontation, their historical and 
cultural ties have since eliminated any useless prejudices. It 
is with this intimate relationship that we seriously want to 
establish a new force to face challenges and tackle various 
economic and political problems to serve our common interests. 
  Nevertheless, we feel that the island dispute has been 
dragging on unwarrantably although the matter has not been 
raised at the international level. Meetings and discussions 
have taken place alternately, but there has been no agreement to 
settle the matter. Indeed, it is not logical that the close 
relationship may be affected simply by the dispute over two 
small islands. As the islands are small, we hope that only few 
meetings will be needed to settle the matter in a very short 
time. Will lengthy discussions mean that the two sides are not 
being serious? Perhaps the postponement of a ministerial 
meeting from last Saturday until next year was indicative of 
their lack of determination and seriousness. The islands have 
commercial value and can be developed into tourist resorts and 
marine sports centers. Both nations recognize this potential 
and any delayed solution will surely inflict financial losses to 
both sides. 
  Nevertheless, we are convinced that Malaysia and Indonesia 
strongly hope that something positive will come out of a 
three-day meeting of the Joint Working Group on Sipadan and 
Ligitan Islands due to start in Jakarta on 7 September. We are 
strongly convinced that this trivial matter will be settled in a 
spirit of harmony and compromise if we are serious about seeking 
a solution. Izhar Ibrahim, director general for political 
affairs of the Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs [name 
and title as published], who headed a 29-member Indonesian 
delegation, said that his country was committed to seeking 
whatever means is available to settle the dispute in a spirit of 
friendship. 
  In fact, the two nations have agreed on many matters at the 
negotiating table. Let's see cooperation in the automobile and 
aircraft industries, which have not only demonstrated the 
expertise of the Malay nations but have also contributed to 
ASEAN efforts to further enhance cooperation in Southeast Asia. 
We are also happy over Indonesia's full support for the 
establishment of the East Asian Economic Caucus [EAEC] and 
commitment to the establishment of a growth triangle covering 
Sumatera in Indonesia, southern Thailand, and the northern part 
of peninsular Malaysia, and over the fact that Indonesia has 
increased the frequency of sea and air traffic between the 
peninsula and Sumatera, encouraged the development of the 
financial services industry, and signed an investment guarantee 
agreement with Malaysia. Cooperation in trade, information, 
science and technology, agriculture, and tourism can be further 
developed to cover various new issues.
