  [Text] Tokyo, Jan 21 KYODO -- Timber producing and 
consuming countries have basically agreed to establish a new 
fund for sustainable management of tropical forests, Japanese 
Government sources said Friday [21 January]. 
  They reached an accord during negotiations in Geneva to 
revise the International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA). 
  The new agreement will place more emphasis on preservation 
of 
tropical forests than the present accord which came into effect 
in 1984 and will expire in March this year, the sources said. 
  Both sides have agreed to specify that trade of tropical 
timber be from products from forests under sustainable 
management by the year 2000, the sources said. 
  Representatives of 36 producing nations such as Indonesia 
and 
Malaysia, and 33 consuming countries, including Japan and the 
United States, have been negotiating in Geneva since January 10 
for revising the agreement. 
  The compromise has been reached as producing nations have 
withdrawn demand for consuming nations to abide by the same 
principles of sustainable management for temperate forests on 
their own land. 
  In return, consuming nations will be obliged to issue a 
joint 
statement on cutting down their own forests, with consideration 
given to the environment, as well as set up the new fund, the 
sources said. 
  Japan, whose imports of tropical forest timber are the 
world's largest at 15 million cubic meters a year, will be 
requested to take more responsibility in extending financial aid 
to developing nations through the fund, the sources said. 
  The International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO), which 
is in charge of keeping the ITTA, is headquartered in Yokohama.
