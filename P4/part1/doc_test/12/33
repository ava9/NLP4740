DR Mahathir Mohammed, the Malaysian prime minister, devotes a good deal of
his time these days to ridiculing western environmentalists and criticising
their attempts to restrict trade in tropical timber.
At last month's summit of the Association of South-East Asian Nations in
Singapore, he pointed out that the rich industrialised countries, having
deforested their own land, were now causing most of the world's pollution
while begging developing countries not to cut down trees.
He disputed the idea that tropical forests were a common heritage of the
world and - perhaps letting his imagination get carried away - claimed that
wealthy, technologically advanced nations could plant even deserts with
tropical hardwoods and so triple the area of tropical timberland within a
century.
More forests can be saved by preventing forest fires or putting them out
quickly, Dr Mahathir added, than by boycotting the export of tropical timber
or advocating that forest dwellers remain in the forest, eating monkeys and
suffering from all kinds of tropical diseases.
Malaysia has good reason to be defensive about the timber trade. It accounts
for nearly half the world's recorded exports of tropical timber, compared to
26.7 per cent for Indonesia and a mere 2.4 per cent for Brazil.
That Brazil - the most notorious environmental villain to ordinary,
green-thinking people - should account for so small share of the trade is
perhaps the best illustration of the lack of correlation between
deforestation and timber exports.
The Gatt report on the environment takes up this theme with enthusiasm,
saying that a ban on trade in logs and processed tropical timber would have
a miniscule effect because such exports amount to less than 1 per cent of
the trees felled in developing countries. Those calling for restrictions on
tropical timber exports have an especially unconvincing case for trade
restraints on environmental grounds, the report says.
Environmentalists would be the first to agree that general deforestation is
usually the result of farming or tree-cutting for fuel (as wood or charcoal)
rather than logging.
Nor would they dispute the Gatt report's assertions that deforestation could
be slowed by compensating lower-income countries for preserving large
forests and by promoting employment and income growth for the rural poor.
But they note that loggers build roads which allow others to encroach on
virgin forest (even if it is true that the - all too rare - responsible
logging enterprises protect their concessions from illegal loggers for their
own financial benefit).
The environmentalists also say that the arguments deployed by the likes of
the Malaysian government and the Gatt report tend to lump trees together as
if they were all of the same species.
The problem is not just one of deforestation, they say, but the
indiscriminate harvesting of rare hardwoods which need decades to regenerate
themselves.
With a logging ban announced, if not enforced, in Thailand, Thai
entrepreneurs have taken to plundering the teak and other hardwood trees of
Burma, Laos and Cambodia, a trade which also allows them to disguise
illegally felled Thai trees as imports from neighbouring countries.
I don't know how you can control that if you don't put controls on trade,
says one environmentalist in Bangkok.
