<F P=106> [Article by Kamal Ahmad: "Air Force Structure To Be </F>
Reorganized"] 
  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 4 January--On 4 January 
the Ministry of Defense ordered the structure of the Tentera 
Udara Diraja Malaysia (TUDM) [Royal Malaysian Air Force] to be 
reorganized to be more flexible and to allow every individual 
member to assume greater responsibility. 
  Minister of Defense Najib bin Tun Razak said that the 
reorganization also has the objective of ensuring better 
management of the organization at every level in the force. 
  He said that with the changes in the organizational 
structure 
of the Air Force one person will be responsible if an error is 
made. 
  He told a press conference in Kuala Lumpur on 4 January: "An 
investigation made by the Inspectorate of the Royal Malaysian 
Air Force has brought out the fact that there is no single body 
in the organization which is responsible for collecting, 
analyzing, and assessing the most recent data and information 
regarding aircraft and aircraft components. 
  "The procurement of spare parts is based on information on 
stores obtained when the aircraft is purchased and has not been 
available for a long time." 
  According to the minister, the reorganization is based on a 
number of weaknesses that became apparent and that were 
identified by the chief of the Royal Malaysian Air Force 
Inspectorate during the investigation of the Super Puma 
helicopter accident at Sungai Petani on 31 December, which took 
the lives of four members of the Air Force. 
  The minister said that the accident was a serious misfortune 
for the seven aircraft which the Royal Malaysian Air Force 
purchased in 1993. 
  He said: "The initial investigation of the accident was 
concerned with the cover of the gear box which was separated 
from the aircraft. 
  "Based on evidence obtained so far, the Royal Malaysian Air 
Force has rejected the possibility of human error as the direct 
cause of the accident. However, the investigation is still going 
on." 
  Najib said that the logistics control system of the Royal 
Malaysian Air Force is still essentially done by hand, and there 
is no system for checking on the more than 200,000 items of 
equipment presently managed by the logistics section. 
  According to the minister, he will review the latest report 
to the cabinet concerning the Super Puma accident to determine 
the cause of the accident and the steps for the Royal Malaysian 
Air Force to take to prevent such an accident from being 
repeated. 
  He said that the investigation is concentrated on two 
aspects. That is, the direct cause of the accident which is 
being investigated by Air Force inspectors and a review and 
consideration of procedures for handling, controlling and 
administering the helicopter unit. 
  The task of investigation is being assisted by foreign 
experts, including the makers of the aircraft, Industri Pesawat 
Terbang Nusantara (IPTN) [Nusantara Aircraft Industry] of 
Indonesia, and Eurocopter of France, a company that designs 
helicopters. 
  The investigation of the accident is still going on, and 
portions of the aircraft which have been found have been 
delivered to the Defense Science Research Center in Kuala Lumpur. 
  Asked whether the report on the accident will be made 
public, 
Najib said that that depended on a decision by the government. 
  Answering a question regarding the possibility that the 
purchase of the Super Puma helicopters was influenced by 
political pressures, Najib said: "I do not know. What we can see 
is that there was nothing wrong in our decision to buy the Super 
Puma, and there is no evidence indicating that this decision was 
unwise." 
  Regarding a government commitment to buy two more Super Puma 
helicopters, he said that the Royal Malaysian Air Force has no 
plans to do that. 
  Asked about the possibility that the government is reviewing 
its original decision to purchase CN2353 aircraft made by IPTN 
to replace Caribou aircraft, Najib said: "For any purchase made 
from whatever source we must be sure that the item concerned 
meets the standards of quality and cost established by the Royal 
Malaysian Air Force. 
  "In the future any purchase of equipment will be required to 
satisfy these aspects. I do not reject the possibility that we 
will buy another aircraft from IPTN, provided the company meets 
our needs." 
  Najib also said that the government has not yet made a 
decision on a commitment to purchase several transport and 
helicopter aircraft from Indonesia. He said: "We have not yet 
made a decision. However, discussions are still going on."
