  [Text] Datuk Mohamed Noh Rajab, parliamentary secretary to 
the Ministry of Land and Cooperatives Development, opened the 
24th meeting of the Indonesia-Malaysia Joint Technical Committee 
on Demarcation and Survey in Langkawi today. 
  Following the meeting he told newsmen that the 
Indonesia-Malaysia common border problem is expected to be 
completely settled within a period of six years. He said that 
several areas along the common border, which are difficult for 
the surveyors to identify, will be completely demarcated by the 
year 2000. This is possible through close cooperation between 
the two countries. Last year, the duration for the demarcation 
and survey work along the common border was increased to seven 
months annually instead of three months as it was in the past. 
He said that efforts to settle the problem have to be 
intensified because even though the joint demarcation project 
was launched 19 years ago, only 27 percent of the East 
Kalimatan-Sabah boundary line and 35 percent of the West 
Kalimantan-Sarawak border have been surveyed and demarcated.
