MR LIM Kem Yaik, Malaysia's minister of primary industries, yesterday
attacked importing countries for 'bashing' tropical timber exporting
countries for their own ends. He said that those who criticised tropical
countries should show goodwill and patience.
Speaking at the opening here of the 12th meeting of International Tropical
Timber Organisation, Mr Lim called for an end to unilateral decisions to
boycott the purchase of tropical wood by national governments and individual
organisations. He cited the plight of Sarawak, Malaysia, where decisions to
reduce tropical logging by 1.5m cubic metres in 1992 and similar amount in
1993 in response to ITTO recommendations had meant the loss of 26,000 jobs
and USDollars 50m.
Producer and consumer country members of the ITTO are divided over the
future role of the organisation. Mr Lim restated his views that trade in
timber from temperate forests should be considered alongside tropical
interests. He said he wanted to see the present renegotiation of the
International Tropical Timber Agreement expanded to include all world
forests.
With less than 10 per cent of world international trade being in tropical
wood and the rest of temperate origin, the minister said that the new
agreement, scheduled to be in place by March 1994, should widen its scope.
But tropical timber importing countries do not agree.
Mr Menzo Baratini, spokesman for the European Community, pointed out that
the ITTO was set up specifically for tropical timber and had developed
principles and strategies aimed at ensuring sustainable management of
tropical forests by the year 2000. The system of annual national reporting
on progress toward sustainable management of productive tropical forests
should be standardised, he said, adding that ITTO's real objectives should
be in the field of trade.
The ITTO meeting takes place against a background of steeply rising prices
for tropical timber from Asia Pacific sources. Sawn wood and plywood prices
have leapt 40 per cent over recent months as log production and export in
the Sabah and Sarawak States of Malaysia have fallen in response to moves to
conserve forest resources in terms of sustainability and industrial
requirements.
