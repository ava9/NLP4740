  [Text] Jakarta, Jan 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysian 
International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz has urged 
ASEAN countries not to give in to pressures by big countries to 
change the forum of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation 
(APEC) into a formal institution. 
  Malaysia will not give in to pressures and we hope other 
ASEAN countries will do the same, she said during a dialogue 
session to expose Indonesian businessmen on trade and investment 
opportunities in Malaysia here Friday. 
  Responding to a question on Malaysia's stand towards APEC 
which a dialogue participant said differed to that of other 
ASEAN countries, she said Malaysia had no objection to 
cooperation between Asia and Pacific as it was a loose forum and 
programme and project orientated. 
  What we disagree is turning APEC into a structural and 
formal 
institution, holding summits for country leaders and, with its 
secretariat expanding and no longer programme and project 
orientated, she said. 
  Rafidah, who is leading a 25-member delegation for a two-day 
visit to Indonesia, said ASEAN would lose out if APEC were to be 
a formal institution. 
  Why we don't want it to be so because ASEAN, with its six 
countries, has 320 million people. We have long promoted ASEAN. 
We shouldn't be submerged in Asia-Pacific and losing our voice 
in a formal APEC, she said. 
  It was for this reason, she said, that Malaysia proposed the 
East Asia Economic Caucas (EAEC) with ASEAN as the backbone. 
  Rafidah also called on ASEAN businessmen to be more 
aggresive 
in establishing economic cooperation among them apart from 
intensifying efforts to set up joint venture companies. 
  They should exploit the rapid economic growth in the region, 
like their non-ASEAN counterparts were doing, she said. 
  She said such cooperation was vital in pooling together 
their 
experience, expertise, and financial resources in order to 
compete with non-ASEAN entrepreneurs not only in the region but 
also elsewhere. 
  Earlier, Rafidah held discussions with Trade Minister Satrio 
Judono on bilateral trade as well as regional and global issues. 
  She also met Research and Technology Minister B.J. Habibie 
where she discussed the possiblility of Malaysia participating 
in Indonesia's aviation industry.
