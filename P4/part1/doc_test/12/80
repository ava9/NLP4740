US INDUSTRY representatives were anxiously watching for signs yesterday that
Mr Mickey Kantor and Sir Leon Brittan, the top trade officials of the US and
EC - who began a two-day meeting in Washington - would make progress in
efforts to eliminate tariffs on a wide range of products.
There has been little news out of preliminary meetings held over the weekend
between Mr Warren Lavorel, the US Gatt co-ordinator, and Mr Hugo Paemen, the
chief EC trade negotiator.
Much could depend on the outcome of the dispute over the EC Utilities
Directive, which, the US argues, makes it difficult for US companies to win
telecommunications and electrical equipment contracts. A settlement could
produce momentum in the multilateral procurement talks in Geneva and in the
Uruguay Round of talks as a whole.
Failure to reach agreement, followed by US sanctions against EC companies,
might dampen the mood, although US officials say they will try to segregate
the issue from the rest of the round.
On the market access package, agreement was reported to be near on
pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and construction equipment. However, the
question of including scientific and agricultural equipment must still be
aired.
The talks on forest products have been in some trouble. The EC has
complained about export restrictions of logs from the US, Malaysia and
Indonesia, making elimination of the restrictions a condition to reduce or
eliminate tariffs.
This was 'a red herring' as far as the US is concerned, said Mr Stephen
Lovett, of the National Forest Products Association. US logs were of 'little
economic significance' to the EC, although Indonesian exports were more of a
problem.
Chemical tariffs are also at issue, with the EC disagreeing about some
exceptions the US wants to take. The Community also could demand more from
American 'donor industries' - those such as textiles, ceramics and glassware
which will be forced to give up tariff protection.
Mr Lovett and Mr William Lane, government affairs representative for
Caterpillar, stressed the necessity of producing 'a major market access
package' containing a 'very strong zero tariff component', to make the
Uruguay Round of talks saleable to Congress.
'Overnight the business attitude would change from ambivalence to
enthusiasm,' Mr Lane said.
Caterpillar and other big US equipment makers face tariffs of 4-10 per cent
in most developed countries and over 15 per cent in developing countries.
'It's difficult to offset the extra burden of import tariffs,' the company
said in its proposal to reduce tariffs to zero on construction equipment,
diesel engines, lift trucks, and industrial gas turbine engines.
