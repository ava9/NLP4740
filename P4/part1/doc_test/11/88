The Oscar-winning "My Left Foot" provides plenty of kick for any project to 
which its writer-director, Jim Sheridan, attaches his name. By agreeing to 
serve as "story consultant" on "Illegals" -- a film written and to be directed 
by Nye Heron, his assistant on "My Left Foot" -- the project raised enough 
money in the U.S. and Europe to begin production in mid-July in the Bronx. The 
Mike George Production tells of a romance between two illegal immigrants, an 
Irish lad and a Dominican woman. KIRK HONEYCUTT
