"I WORSHIP the paper he writes on!" That's what Madonna says about the prolific 
and talented Andrew Lloyd Webber -- and with good reason. Any minute, there 
will be an official announcement stating that the star of the coming "Dick 
Tracy" movie is definitely set to play the long a'borning female protagonist in 
the film version of "Evita." 
</P>
<P>
I know, I know -- Madonna was up for this movie once before and it didn't work 
out. Then-to-be-director Oliver Stone wanted her to audition for him before she 
could be cast; he says Madonna refused. (As you know, practically every actress 
who can even hum has been considered for the role of the late wife of the 
Argentine dictator, Juan Peron of the '40s.) 
</P>
<P>
Stone went on actually to audition and then hire Meryl Streep for the part. The 
actress bowed out some months ago, saying she was exhausted. This was in the 
middle of her back-to-back filmings of "She-Devil" and "Postcards From the 
Edge." Now Stone is also out of the "Evita" project. 
</P>
<P>
This time, no director has yet been chosen. But the movie will begin filming in 
the fall. I think Madonna was born to play Eva Peron and she may just be 
brilliant as the infamous first lady who sings Tim Rice's immortal words, 
"Don't cry for me, Argentina!" If everything goes according to plan, Webber 
will be a very busy man from now until at least the end of the year. He'll have 
two of the biggest movie projects in show biz history -- "Evita" and "The 
Phantom of the Opera" being filmed at the same time.

OH, FORGET those ridiculous gloom and doom rumors about liquor bottles hidden 
under her bed and just know that Elizabeth Taylor is doing just fine. She is 
already 43 pounds lighter and in good spirits. The other day, Shirley MacLaine 
came to visit La Liz at St. John's Hospital, bearing a large chocolate cake in 
an unmentionable male shape. She also brought along a naughty X-rated movie. 
The two famous ladies devoured half the cake and hooted and howled at the film.

MTV HAS shown us Cher's nearly naked backside (after 9 p.m. at night, that is) 
and they've offered up Madonna in chains. But the powers that be at MTV draw 
the line at "male" bondage. At least they weren't too thrilled with the group 
Revenge and their "Pineapple Face" video. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Playboy's Suze Randall, this offering has been deemed 
"unacceptable," because -- among other things -- it features male band members 
wearing chastity belts around their necks. 
</P>
<P>
Just remember how fastidious MTV can be the next time they show you some half 
nude woman squirming and writhing under male domination. MTV does have its 
limits -- sort of. Chauvinistic ones.
