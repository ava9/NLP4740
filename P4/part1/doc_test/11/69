OSCARS '94
SISTER ACT 2 (PG) Bill Duke
BEETHOVEN'S 2nd (U) Rod Daniel
DAENS (15) Stijn Coninx
A lightbulb thought occurred to me on Tuesday morning, as I consumed two
pieces of toast and a cup of tea in the company of Steven Spielberg, Tom
Hanks and Holly Hunter. Europe first watches the Oscars over breakfast and
surely sees this spree in truer light than any other population on the
planet. It is not about art or entertainment or even industry. It is about
family: with implications for western civilisation that we shall come to
shortly.
The world's most high-visibility exercise in self-congratulation has all the
innocence, though lit to blinding wattage, of a family gathered round the
morning cornflakes tearing open Junior's school report, Daddy's letter of
promotion and Mummy's pregnancy-test result. And this family - the
Hollywoods At Home - has another common family trait: keep-out exclusiveness
trying to turn itself into come-in warmth.
I think I twigged to this during Master Spielberg's acceptance speech.
Holding high his first ever statuette, the bearded wonderperson said
something about 'the six million people who can't be watching this tonight.'
For one nanosecond, it was as if Tinseltown really thought that the world -
not just all its countries, but all its lost generations - might be curable
by this annual riot of messianic togetherness: in which each year, around
Resurrection-time on the Christian calendar, a whole lot of industry
parents, children, uncles, aunts and cousins troop along, each bearing his
or her emotive constituency of thanks and good causes. Can you leave your
handkerchief untouched at so much good will?
Master Hanks, winning for Philadelphia and possibly auditioning for
Philadelphia 2, spoke up tearfully for Aids victims. Master Spielberg said
it for the absent friends of Jewish history. Auntie Holly (Hunter)
loquaciously represented the world's mutes, winning Best Actress for her
wordless role in The Piano. And Grandpa Paul Newman was presented with a
lifetime good causes award, gaining a special statuette for giving away
Dollars 80 million dollars' revenue from salad dressing.
Each member of the Hollywood clan had prepared his or her party-piece for
the underprivileged, as the atmosphere got more Dickensian by the minute. In
this orgy of PC and goodwill, there were only two persons slightly letting
the side down. One was hostess Whoopi Goldberg, who aimed a mocking quip at
her own multiple-threat ethnicity (black, Jewish . . . ) plus humanitarian
record (see Sister Act 2 below). The other was Uncle Tommy Lee Jones, who in
protesting that he was not really bald might have been seen as reinforcing
prejudice against the trichologically challenged.
Never mind: the evening's mixture of good causes and family feeling was
clinched by Miss Anna Paquin (aged 11), winning Best Supporting Actress for
The Piano. I confess I stopped right in mid-toast-chew for this one. The
diminutive thespian behaved just like your own little Laura/Megan/Tracy
going up to get her acting prize on Founder's Day. She advanced to the
platform, opened her mouth and no words came out. She stood there making
gasping motions like a distressed guppy; though on a second viewing it
started to look a little rehearsed. Perhaps she had been deputed to deliver
the 'mute' speech that Auntie Holly, who as Best Actress had to say
something and say it good, could not get away with.
It is sometimes said that the Oscars are decrepit, demode, de-everything
else you can think of. But I suspect that they are on the up and up: that
given time they will take over the western world's Ideal Family franchise,
now that our own dear dynasty has been shot down by the tabloids and its own
self-destruct instincts.
With Hollywood fast becoming the only dependable royalty, Oscar night itself
is becoming everything the Queen's Christmas speech used to be or to try to
be. It gives us a glimpse of the world as a giant mutual-help family. Woe
betide, if it has not already betid, anyone who brings cynicism to the
gathering. And lest you think I am fully armed with irony, let me say that
this viewer too shed a tear during Hanks's speech. There are times when the
line between real goodness and showbiz goodness becomes terrifyingly blurred
and we all get sucked in.
The game of Hollywood Happy Families, incorporating Hollywood One-Worldism,
does not stop at Oscar night. Sequelitis is a variation on the same
phenomenon. Look, if you can bear to, at Sister Act 2 and Beethoven's 2nd.
In the first Miss Goldberg is back in nun's habit, pouring good deeds over a
closure-threatened San Francisco high school. Can she teach the brats to
warble rock spirituals and win the all-state singing competition? That way
the school will stay open, causing Mother Superior Maggie Smith to weep into
her wimple and wicked school administrator James Coburn to gnash Dollars
5000 worth of Beverly Hills bridgework.
The film (awful) is upstaged by the publicity hand-out, even in the area of
good deeds. Miss Goldberg in her biog is cited for her 'tireless
humanitarian efforts on behalf of children, the homeless, human rights,
substance abuse and the battle against Aids.' Goodness. And on top of that
she has twice been required to act out, in the Sister Act films, a very
parable of Oscar night itself. For Las Vegas showgirl undergoing short-lease
metamorphosis as convent sister, read the population of Tinseltown turning
each Easter into a pan-global spiritual support system.
That sequels themselves are manifestations of a deep-rooted family instinct
 -they used, you recall, to be called 'Son Of Such-and-Such' - is basic
psycho-cultural diagnosis. What is more reassuring to Movieland's patriarchs
and matriarchs than the patter of tiny spin-offs around the house?
Beethoven's 2nd gives us not just an addition to this movie family but a
two-family storyline within itself. One is human: Charles Grodin and his
two-up-two-down nuclear foursome living in springcleaned suburbia. The other
is canine: Beethoven the St Bernard and his new love and their litter of
ooh-aah pups.
It is, be warned, frightful stuff. The press show audience was notably
silent, some parts of it being in deep shock, others in deep sleep. This is
a 'comedy' with no laughs and ladlefuls of sentimentality. But in Familyland
you must take the syrupy-smooth with the exhilaratingly rough. When
togetherness does not come out fighting it tends just to sit there, wearing
a gooey smile in the sun and getting stickier and stickier.
We all deserve one non-Hollywood experience this week, but we wish it had
not been Daens. As Belgian films about the late-19th century Flemish trade
union movement go, this one portentously dawdles. One 'Up the workers'
set-piece follows another, with the street fights scored for inspirational
music (out of Hoffa by FIST) being marginally preferable to the
love-across-the-barricades romance between Marxist boy and Christian
Democrat girl (out of Elvira Madigan by The Ballad Of Joe Hill). Stijn
Coninx directs. Jan Declair steals a few scenes as the eponymous
agitator-priest, resembling Gene Wilder ventriloquised by Ian Paisley.
