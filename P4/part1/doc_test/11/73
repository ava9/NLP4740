Here are some of the rewards offered to good filmmakers across the world. In
America, they give Oscars; in Britain, Baftas; in France, Cesars; in Europe,
Felixes; in China, detention sentences and/or visa confiscations.
This is what happened to Tian Zhuangzhuang. 'Where is he?' we cried last
year at Cannes when his film The Blue Kite became the sleeper of the
Directors Fortnight. This movie about the everyday terrors of life under the
sway of Mao and his Little Red Mind should be spoken of in the same awed
breath as Farewell My Concubine. Passion, compassion and a searching,
majestic irony join together in the history of a family concussed by
Communism.
So where was Tian? Back in China after having his exit visa taken away. And
why does The Blue Kite trespass across forbidden political airspace? Because
it chronicles 20 years in the life of a family based on Tian's own as its
members endure the cruel, interchangeably wintry seasons of Maoist rule.
From the Sino-Stalinism of the early 1950s the film moves through the
'Hundred Flowers' and the 'Great Leap Forward' and finally the Cultural
Revolution. Iced-up movements all: designed less to enhance or advance the
lives of the people than to crystallise the tyrannies of their leaders.
Nothing wintry, though, about the movie. Characters sketched with lightest
shadings grow their own irresistible warmth and colour as we watch. There is
the librarian Shujuan (Lu Liping), wistfully enduring a life of serial
wedlock as she loses one husband to political exile, then marries his
repentant betrayer, then ends up with a dried-out old Professor. There are
her quizzical, button-bright son Tietou (our main point-of-view character);
her yappy Marxist sister; her sweet-natured, weak-willed brother, who loses
his girlfriend to one of several passing purges; and others still, filling
up a fresco of Chinese street life that seems real to every brushstroke.
Tian portrays this life built on deprivation and thought-policing with a
naturalism at once tender and abrasive. Popular Maoist songs are offered up
for mockery: 'We don't give peace to invaders or bad people]' sing a bunch
of wedding guests; 'Wipe out waste, decay and bureaucracy]' warble a group
of schoolchildren. But the movie never stops at mere scorn. It swells from
the modest, multiple-choice pathos of early scenes - divided families,
fractured loyalties - to a kind of vast silent tragedy: the story of a
nation whose people survived despite an experiment in nationhood that
grimly, resoundingly failed.
Wayne's World shocked the planet recently by disproving King Lear's theory
that nothing will come of nothing. Two completely empty heads, the comedy
showed, could fill cinema cash registers across the globe. Wayne (Michael
Myers) was the head with long dark hair and a face like a Halloween turnip.
Garth (Dana Carvey) was the head with long blond hair and a face like Norman
Bates's mother. When not co-hosting their DIY chat show on public-access TV,
our teenage twosome sallied forth from Aurora, Illinois, to spread the
gospel of rock culture and insane catch-phrases.
In Wayne's World 2 they stage a 'real' pop concert - Waynestock - with help
from Kim Basinger, Charlton Heston, Aerosmith, Rip Taylor and any other
celebrity who happened to be trapped inside Paramount Studio's perimeter
fence during shooting.
This is the mixture as before, so why is it so much funnier? One reason: its
silliness-on-a-loop humour works like mesmerism, lulling you with repetition
before manipulating your funny-bone at will. Reason two: in translating
themselves to movies from their Saturday Night Live American TV slot, Myers
and Carvey have developed a flair for duffing up movie lore itself. Jurassic
Park, Field Of Dreams and The Graduate are among a dozen-odd films invited
into the script's orbit in order to be knocked about. And the best joke is a
delayed-action gem about the function of melons, chicken crates and sheets
of replacement glass when wheeled into place on a movie street.
Most comedy traditions can be seen in terms of Biblical genealogies. Bill
and Ted begat Wayne and Garth and Wayne and Garth might have begotten - by
triangular interbreeding with Monty Python - Jacquouille and Godefroy in Les
Visiteurs. This has been the greatest box-office success, bar none, in
French cinema history. Fourteen million Gauls have paid umpteen million
francs to watch a medieval knight and his squire (tall and stately Jean
Reno, squat and manic Christian Chalonge) flung into present-day Languedoc
after a mix-up with a witches' spell.
Here they experience culture shock and so does the audience. (How is your
ear for 1990s-colloquialised Medieval French?) The posh hotel in which
Jacquouille and Godefroy run bewilderedly amok is none other than J's old
family castle now converted into a relais and managed by limp-wristed
Jacques-Hebri (Chalonge doubling up). It is also owned by a descendant of
the knight's 12th century fiancee Beatrix (Valerie Lemercier, France's
answer to Penelope Keith, also doubling up).
There is, as you see, much doubling up: more than there may be among
non-French audiences. Having taken a nervous eternity to reach Britain, the
film now offers its blend of esoteric Gallic humour with high-pressure
subtitles. Will audiences in outer Wolverhampton crack up at the sight of
two time-confused Middle-Agers washing their faces in a bidet? Or throwing
Chanel No 5 into the bath as if it were bath mousse? (But what would they
know about bath mousse?) Or falling foul of 'supermarkets,' those strange
indoor stadiums filled with wire-mesh chariots?
And so on, with a mixture of overzealous slapstick and undernourished
reliance on the hilarity of anachronism. Jean-Marie Poire's film suggests
that more than a Channel Tunnel is needed to create a trans-manche link
between French and non-French senses of humour. But then they may say the
same after seeing Wayne's World 2.
But Les Visiteurs is beaten to this week's wooden spoon. That is shared
between Garth Maxwell's Jack Be Nimble from Australia and Michael
Steinberg's Bodies, Rest And Motion from the US.
The first is a ill-stirred stew of violence, hypnosis and revenge, all about
two separated-when-young siblings (Alexis Arquette, Sarah Smuts-Kennedy) who
reunite for a spot of grown-up carnage. Steinberg's film is an Arizona-set
tale of drifting lovers. Here the wooden spoon could have been used to hit
everyone over the head. It might have instilled some vitality into Eric
Stoltz, Bridget Fonda and Phoebe Cates; though Britain's Tim Roth does
better, leavening his portentous Zen-buddyist dialogue with an almost
plausible South-Western accent. The title, by the way, comes from one of
Newton's Laws: but not the one about the danger of sitting near overripe or
prententious plantings in case they drop heavy objects on you.
See instead Bertolucci's 25-year-old The Conformist, reissued in a new print
and looking a dream. Which of course it is: the reveries of a 1930s
political chameleon (Jean-Louis Trintignant), evolving from closet
homosexual to Fascist hit man to casualty of history. The images dazzle; the
camera behaves like Torvill and Dean on hallucinogens. A good film-maker
reaches his peak of almost-greatness, just before he sold out to
gift-wrapped Maoism (The Last Emperor) and guff-wrapped existentialism (The
Sheltering Sky).
