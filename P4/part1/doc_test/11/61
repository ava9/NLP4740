CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: 'SON OF SODERBERGH' FAILS TO MATERIALIZE; 
</P>
<P>
THERE WAS NO 'SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE' AMONG THE FILMS AT U. S. FILM FESTIVAL, 
BUT THERE WAS MUCH WORTH SEEING

PARK CITY, Utah 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a year ago, almost to the hour, that Steven Soderbergh sat nervously 
through his first public screening of "sex, lies, and videotape" at the United 
States Film Festival and walked out into almost a parody scene of agents and 
distributors pressing the flesh -- in his case, pressing their business cards 
into his flesh. 
</P>
<P>
Soderbergh is an internationally acclaimed director now. The Cannes Film 
Festival, where "sex, lies" won the Gold Palm and its star James Spader was 
named best actor, fixed that. But for Soderbergh, as for others before him, the 
yellow brick road began here on the eastern slope of the Utah Rockies where he 
returned triumphant this year to serve as a juror -- a writer-director with a 
major studio contract taking his jurying duties very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The image of Soderbergh's success haunted the place. You could see it in 
journalists comparing notes, trying to second-guess what the new hit would be 
and who it would come from. You could see it in the young film makers, hungry 
to shoulder their "burdens" of celebrity and the choices that success could 
bring. 
</P>
<P>
But, while no "sex, lies, and videotape" emerged, there certainly were 
discoveries to be made, if you looked carefully. 
</P>
<P>
It may be presumptuous to "discover" a director who's won a MacArthur 
Foundation Grant, the "genius" award, which film maker Charles Burnett has 
done. But in plain fact, "To Sleep With Anger," which the gently self-effacing 
Burnett wrote and directed, may bring an end to his relative anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
A bracingly unexpected story, which never quite goes in a predictable 
direction, it gives Danny Glover his richest, most multilayered role to date as 
Harry Mention, a friend from the Old South who comes to visit his great old 
friends, Gideon and Susie, living comfortably among their children and 
grandchildren in a big old house in South Central Los Angeles, and very nearly 
brings the place down around them. 
</P>
<P>
Glover may have been the magnet around which financing and the producers 
gathered. But he is only the most visible member of a brilliant ensemble, whom 
Burnett works like a chamber orchestra, letting the cello tones of Paul 
Butler's Gideon play against the viola beauty of actress Mary Alice, as Susie. 
This is the cream of ensemble actors, playing the jealousies and strains, 
duties and devotions among three generations of a family. It's not quite black 
Chekhov, but it's not unreasonable to think of Chekhov as you watch. 
</P>
<P>
Everett Lewis, whose "Natural History of Parking Lots" became the buzz film 
among the critical community, will probably never go Soderbergh's route. With 
his mesmerizing black-and-white movie about screwed-up advantaged kids in 
eerily unused Hancock Park mansions, he's no more mainstream material than Jim 
Jarmusch, but he is an original. He has workshopped at the hosting Sundance 
Institute on his next film; this one is already invited to the Berlin Festival. 
With his generous take on life and youth, his artist's eye and a deadpan humor, 
he's one to watch. In any case, rail thin at more than six feet, with a laugh 
that once got him thrown off a bus, Lewis is almost impossible not to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Over at the Discovery Program, set up to give people in other branches of the 
movie industry a chance to direct, were two more finds. 
</P>
<P>
"Private Debts," which has taken prizes at two festivals before Park City, is 
haunting. To be discovered here are its first-time director, Nancy Cooperstein, 
and the extraordinary, luminous performance of its central actress, Sheila 
Kelley. The story of how the perceived pressures of society force a young woman 
to sacrifice the thing dearest to her is played out in small-town California. 
From the film's assured details, Cooperstein's strength seems to be in her work 
with actors; there's also great swirl and motion to the dance sequences at the 
heart of the action. It's the debut of a director with her own style and the 
humanistic sensibilities of a Martin Ritt. 
</P>
<P>
Jessie Nelson took "To the Moon, Alice" from a story by the fine novelist Lynn 
Sharon Schwartz. The film follows a young homeless couple who live each night 
on a deserted TV sitcom set. It's a great premise and an almost-realized film 
that gets a little soft at its very close, but as a writer-director, Nelson is 
a talent to mark. 
</P>
<P>
An appealing maverick quality could be found in any number of festival films 
and events. This was, after all, the year that Melvin Van Peebles, the mentor 
of black cinema, was honored with a complete retrospective. Richard Lester, 
another writer-director whose films were honored with a generous roundup this 
year, is out of an equally seditious mold. 
</P>
<P>
When brothers Reginald and Warrington Hudlin took two awards -- the Film 
</P>
<P>
Maker's Trophy and the prize for cinematographic excellence -- for "House 
Party," a hugely engaging rap on black teen-age life, they dedicated the prizes 
to Van Peebles. 
</P>
<P>
There may be a little of Van Peebles' spunk kick-starting "House Party," but 
really, it's amazingly conservative considering that the Hudlins are still shy 
of 35. Their greatly talented cast of kids do the right thing, morally, all the 
time without an adult around, a quirk that will probably give the film's 
distributors, New Line Cinema, a truly "mixed" audience: teen-agers and 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Early word of mouth created the hope that Whit Stillman's "Metropolitan" would 
walk off with the roses, but it's decorously listless. "Metropolitan" hovers 
over a nightly gathering of New York debs and their escorts during the 
Christmas holidays like a solicitous waiter. For sheer jaw-dropping obtuseness, 
this group could probably out-point Dan Quayle, but it hardly seems reason 
enough to dedicate an evening to their company. 
</P>
<P>
Also too far on the proper side is "Longtime Companion," directed by Norman 
Rene, which traces the path of AIDS through a group of New Yorkers from 1981 to 
the present. Its touching performances, particularly by Bruce Davison, Mark 
Lamos and Mary-Louise Parker, won it the Audience Award for drama, but one 
could wish that in a first feature film on the subject, it felt and looked less 
like a TV drama. 
</P>
<P>
The AFI-produced "Hollywood Mavericks" is an paean to sedition, a smartly 
edited, well-thought-out series of conversations with some of the screen's 
better rebels: Martin Scorsese (the fan), Peter Bogdanovich (the historian), 
John Cassavetes (the purist), Alan Rudolph (the poet) and a dozen more, not one 
of them uninteresting for a single frame. 
</P>
<P>
As an unplanned companion piece to "Mavericks" was "Preston Sturges: The Rise 
and Fall of an American Dreamer," the worldly, debilitating history of a talent 
who seemingly couldn't wait to ruin everything he'd gained, including his 
pioneering status as a sound-era writer-director. 
</P>
<P>
Like Sturges' films, which seem to dance before your eyes, "Dancing for Mr. B." 
does that literally. As six of his great ballerinas, one of whom -- Maria 
Tallchief -- was also his wife, contribute a mosaic of details about working 
with George Balanchine, lavishly illustrated by clips of the ballets, it 
doesn't matter that he becomes more, not less mysterious. That was Mr. B., and 
film maker Anne Belle, clearly at home in this world, knows it better than 
most. 
</P>
<P>
Equally lively was "Berkeley in the Sixties," a rigorously bright study of that 
churning period of American political action. To the credit of Mark Kitchell 
and company, the film's intellect is matched by a vivid sense of history; this 
really is the '60s again. It won the Audience Award in the documentary vein, as 
well it might. 
</P>
<P>
If it seems as though the documentaries had run away with the festival, quite 
so. Does it say something about our pull toward "real" life? I doubt it; it may 
just mean that documentarians are becoming poets rather than pedants. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, "James Baldwin: The Price of the Ticket" was one of the 
festival's great emotional jolts; a portrait of the man whose books, in the 
1950s, were primers of political and personal understanding. Those who may 
never have read him will meet an eloquent, resounding and infinitely humane 
spirit. "You were black, impoverished, homosexual," one questioner ventures. 
"Weren't those three strikes against you?" "I thought I'd hit the jackpot," 
Baldwin smiles. 
</P>
<P>
Film makers Karen Thorson and Douglas Dempsey turned to Maya Angelou; Amiri 
Baraka; William Styron; Baldwin's marvelous brother and lifelong companion, 
David, and more, to build their picture of the man who left self-imposed exile 
to come home for the civil rights movement, to "preach the gospel of freedom." 
Asked near the end of his life whether he considered himself bitter, Baldwin 
says with remarkable forbearance that he'd heard about progress for blacks 
since he was in grade school; now, at 62, he was still hearing about it: "How 
much time do you want for your progress?" 
</P>
<P>
Festival judging is sometimes unfathomable. Perhaps the biggest stir at the 
awards ceremony came when "Chameleon Street," Wendell B. Harris Jr.'s uneven, 
ambitious first feature, won the Grand Jury Prize in the dramatic category, 
while Burnett's "To Sleep With Anger" received the Special Award of the jury. 
Reportedly, the judges considered "Chameleon Street's" style more adventurous, 
which is a little like choosing a big zirconian over a small, perfect diamond. 
No matter: as surely as audiences have a taste for subtlety over glitz, 
Burnett's drama will have its day. 
</P>
<P>
For Los Angeles audiences who might like to make up their own minds on these 
films, the AFIfest in April will include among its other Sundance choices the 
documentaries "Berkeley in the Sixties," "Dancing for Mr. B" and "Preston 
Sturges," along with the two grand-prize winners, "H-2 Worker" and "Water and 
Power." Dramatic films will include "Chameleon Street," "Metropolitan" and "The 
Natural History of Parking Lots." Plenty of room for discussion here.
