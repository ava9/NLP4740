author held capture by a fan, begins Feb. 5 in Genoa, Nev., and Los Angeles . . 
. Meanwhile, Julia Roberts takes over the role Kim Basinger turned down in 
Fox's thriller "Sleeping With the Enemy," directed by Joseph Ruben and produced 
by Leonard Goldberg. Shooting begins in February, possibly in Northern 
California. . . .

a challenge duel during the Vietnam war between an American and Viet Cong 
soldier. Max and Micheline Keller will produce. Shooting is tentatively
