<F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Otero from Los Pinos presidential </F>
residence in Mexico City; from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] 
  [Excerpt] [Announcer] This afternoon, around 1400, Mexico 
and Costa Rica signed a bilateral free trade agreement at Los 
Pinos Presidential Palace. President Salinas de Gortari and 
Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier, who 
arrived in Mexico City around noon, signed the document. This 
document, which has 23 chapters, will enter into effect on 1 
January 1995. Here is Elizabeth Diaz Otero with a report: 
  [Diaz] Good afternoon. During the ceremony to sign the 
document, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said the free 
trade agreement between Costa Rica and Mexico will promote 
greater trade and investment, employment, and welfare 
opportunities for both nations. This document, which opens the 
door for the free trade of goods between the two nations, will 
result in greater economic growth and development, and 
consequently more justice with accompanying tangible benefits 
for society. 
  In the presence of Costa Rican President Calderon, who came 
specifically for this ceremony, President Salinas underscored 
that the way to advance Latin American integration is with 
actions, not just words. The meeting took place in the Adolfo 
Lopez Mateos Hall at Los Pinos. President Salinas spoke about 
the diversification of relations between Mexico and other 
countries and the advantages of competition. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] National businesses, especially 
medium-sized and small businesses, will find broader markets 
with differences regarding levels of complexity and development. 
This agreement will benefit economies of scale and facilitate 
the specialization of various goods. With this treaty we sign 
today, we will also promote the development of the comparative 
advantages of all Mexican federal organizations. This agreement 
will lead to strengthening decentralization and federalism 
because domestic producers will be increasingly less dependent 
on the behavior of a single market. [end recording] 
  [Diaz] President Calderon euphorically called this free 
trade 
agreement with Mexico the greatest foreign policy accomplishment 
of his administration because it gives Costa Rican products 
access to the Mexican market, a huge market with 90 million 
people. He gave a long speech in which he said that 5 April 
marked the onset of the 21st century for Costa Rica and praised 
President Salinas, comparing him with Bolivar, Marti, Juarez, 
and San Martin. He emphasized that the free trade agreement 
should not be viewed as a deal that will only favor businessmen. 
  [Begin Calderon recording] The free trade agreement between 
Mexico and Costa Rica should not only be viewed as a matter of 
interest for businessmen and shopowners. The elimination of 
tariffs represents the elimination of economic, mental, and 
cultural barriers. This agreement will have significant 
repercussions for the future of all citizens, and it heralds a 
new period in relations between Mexico and Costa Rica and 
between Costa Rica and the other North American nations. [end 
recording] 
  [Diaz] This free trade agreement between Mexico and Costa 
Rica is considered the most thorough agreement negotiated in 
Latin America. This is so because it contains an entire array 
of rules that will give transparency and security to the 
productive sectors; promote trade in goods and services; protect 
industrial secrets, brands, and copyrights; and facilitate 
investments in both countries. This treaty, as you have said, 
if ratified by the Mexican and Costa Rican senates, will enter 
into force on 1 January 1995. A large number of the tariffs 
will be eliminated -- in the case of Mexican exports, 70 
percent, while in the case of Costa Rican exports, 75 percent. 
This reduction of duties will continue gradually over a decade. 
It will mainly protect agricultural products like meat, 
plantains, poultry products, and sugar. 
  [Announcer] The signing of this treaty is beneficial for 
Costa Rica, as well as for Mexico, of course. I will cite an 
example to give an idea of the figures we are talking about. 
Costa Rica currently exports -- according to 1993 statistics -- 
an average of $60 million to Mexico, mainly raw materials. With 
the signing of this bilateral free trade agreement, Costa Rica 
will be able to increase it sale of goods and services to Mexico 
400 percent. That is, the current value of the market, which is 
$60 million, could grow to $250 million, which is very 
beneficial for Costa Rica and the Mexican commercial opening.
