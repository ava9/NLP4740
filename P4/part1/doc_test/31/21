  [Text] Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier 
said here today the governments of Panama and Costa Rica are 
complying with their bilateral agreements to both countries' 
benefit. 
  [Begin recording] [Calderon] We have maintained the best 
relations with President Endara's government. Our people have 
always maintained good relations in the past and, undoubtably, 
will continue to do so in the future with the new Costa Rican 
president as of May and with whomever you elect to govern Panama 
during the 8 May elections. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What is the status of bilateral 
trade 
between Panama and Costa Rica? Is there anything new? 
  [Calderon] There is nothing new. Very small differences have 
appeared regarding certain products, but through dialogue, as we 
have always done, Panama and Costa Rica have managed to reach an 
agreement and resolve our differences. [end recording]
