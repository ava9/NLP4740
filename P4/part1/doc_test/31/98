Cartagena de Indias; from the "Caracol's Quarter Hour" newscast; 
passages within quotation marks are recorded -- live] 
  [Text] At this time, the tarmac of the Rafael Nunez Airport 
in Cartagena is completely full of aircraft. As the central 
studios have reported, the Spanish royal couple, King Carlos and 
Queen Sofia, arrived from Madrid aboard a Spanish Air Force 
flight at 1535 [2035 GMT] and at 1555 Prime Minister Felipe 
Gonzalez arrived. At 1615 [2115 GMT] Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori arrived. Later, arriving from San Jose, Costa Rica, 
were Costa Rican President Jose Figueres, Salvadoran President 
Armando Calderon Sol, Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio, Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina, Nicaraguan 
President Violeta Chamorro, Panamanian President Guillermo 
Endara, and Brazilian President Itamar Franco, all aboard the 
same Colombian Air Force [FAC] Fokker airplane. Costa Rican 
President Jose Maria Figueres, who was one of the first to 
emerge from the FAC aircraft, said: 
  [Figueres] "We are all pleased to be here. May my first 
words be of solidarity with the Colombian people for last week's 
tragedy." 
  Humanitarian economic development and consolidation of the 
Central American peace process are the main issues the 
presidents of these countries have outlined, upon arriving just 
moments ago at the Rafael Nunez International Airport. 
Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro also greets the Colombian 
people on Radio Caracol. 
  [Chamorro] "Good afternoon, dear friends of Cartagena de 
Indias, dear journalists, and all those listening. This is 
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the president of Nicaragua." 
  The leaders who arrived aboard the special FAC flight also 
expressed their feelings of sympathy for the Colombian people, 
following the catastrophe in Huila and Cauca Departments. 
Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol also offers his 
greetings: 
  [Calderon Sol] "As president of El Salvador, it is a real 
pleasure to be in this generous nation, Colombia, which opens 
its arms to welcome all of the Ibero-American leaders. We all 
believe such summit meetings are very beneficial for our people." 
  Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina briefly addressed 
the 
Colombian people. 
  [Reina] "I offer a fraternal salute to the Colombian people 
and express my sympathy for the trying moments you are 
experiencing." 
  The Group of Three [G-3] nations will sign the G-3 trade 
agreement at 1930 at the guest house for illustrious visitors, 
here in Cartagena de Indias.
