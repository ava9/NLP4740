Costa Rican President-elect Rafael Angel Calderon promised to fight drug 
trafficking in his nation and said his government will have good relations with 
the United States because he is a friend of President Bush. Calderon, who 
defeated the candidate backed by President and Nobel Peace laureate Oscar Arias 
Sanchez on Sunday, said he plans "to turn this victory into the victory of an 
entire people united to fight drug trafficking."
