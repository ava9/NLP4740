  [Text] Taipei, April 20 (CNA) -- The International 
Economic Cooperation Development Fund will extend more than 
U.S.$30 million in Taiwan loans and assistance to Nicaragua, 
Costa Rica, South Africa, and Swaziland as part of President Li 
Teng-hui's planned visit to the four nations next month, a fund 
spokesman said Wednesday [20 April]. 
  Li's tour will take him to Managua, Nicaragua May 4; San 
Jose, Costa Rica May 6; Pretoria, South Africa May 8; and 
Mbabane, Swaziland May 12. Li, who will attend presidential 
inauguration ceremonies in Costa Rica and South Africa, is 
scheduled to return to Taipei May 15. 
  Nicaragua will receive U.S.$1 million in financial support 
from the fund for development of its small and medium 
businesses, while food processing, wood furniture, shoemaking, 
and garment experts will be sent to the country to offer their 
expertise, the spokesman said. 
  The fund will also grant a soft loan of U.S.$15 million to 
Costa Rican banks for financing that country's export-oriented 
small and medium enterprises, he pointed out, adding that the 
loan ceiling for each company is set at U.S.$100,000. 
  For South Africa, he said, a low-interest loan of U.S.$15 
million will be extended to help finance small farms, while 
Swaziland will be given assistance with an airport expansion 
project and the purchase of new airliners. 
  Meanwhile, he said, the fund decided to grant a U.S.$20 
million soft loan to El Salvador to finance its power 
distribution system in line with Premier Lien Chan's expected 
visit to that country in early June. Lien's visit has yet to be 
officially announced. 
  The fund, established in 1988 under the Ministry of Economic 
Affairs, plays a key role in supplying financial and technical 
assistance to developing countries friendly to Taiwan.
