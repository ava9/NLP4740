<F P=106> [Report on interview with Costa Rican President-elect Jose </F>
Figueres by reporter Roberto Reyes at Toncontin International 
Airport; from "The Morning Paper" newscast; date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Costa Rican President-elect Jose Maria Figueres and 
his entourage are en route to El Salvador. Members of his 
cabinet are also accompanying Figueres, who will take office on 
8 May. We have Figueres' remarks while he was at the country's 
largest airport, Toncontin International Airport. 
  [Begin recording, in progress] [Figueres] ....the meetings I 
will hold during the coming months, such as the Ibero American 
meeting, which will be held in Cartagena in June. (?My meeting 
here) was very advantageous. I want to have the best of 
relations with Honduras. I want to have constant, permanent, 
and very fluid relations that will allow us to deal with our 
problems. 
  [Reyes] Mr. President-elect, will Central America's 
integration be strengthened now that Costa Rica will be 
participating directly and firmly, and did you discuss Central 
America's drug-trafficking problem with President Reina? 
  [Figueres] President Reina told me of his concern and firm 
decision to combat every manifestation of drug trafficking. We 
have that same idea in Costa Rica. I believe this is an area in 
which we can cooperate and truly strengthen both countries' 
efforts to be more effective. Drug trafficking is one of modern 
society's everyday problems today, and we must do everything 
within our capability so that the problem will not affect 
Honduras, Costa Rica and, of course, other countries. I believe 
this is an area in which we can make great progress with our 
other Central American neighbors. 
  [Reyes] Will you continue to visit Honduras after you are 
president? 
  [Figueres] Of course, quite frequently. [Words indistinct] 
of seeing me here. 
  [Reyes] Was Central American integration the main topic you 
discussed with the Honduran president? 
  [Figueres] Yes. Costa Rica is keenly interested in making a 
significant contribution to a more effective and beneficial 
integration by all of our countries. 
  [Reyes] What effect will the North American Free Trade 
Agreement between Mexico, Canada, and the United States have on 
Central American unity? 
  [Figueres] That must be decided by all the presidents and 
countries. It is, of course, a topic we must study, and I am 
sure it will take up a considerable portion of agendas for 
future meetings we will hold. 
  [Reyes] Has your assembly made any arrangements for Costa 
Rica to finally become a member of all the Central American 
organizations? 
  [Figueres] We are going to have a new assembly, and we will 
have to see what the deputies think. Meanwhile, we can make 
progress in many other areas. There is much to be done 
concerning the economy and trade, and we want to do all we can 
to emulate Honduras, which is engaged in a permanent struggle 
for Central American integration. 
  [Reyes] Are your views on this issue essential to a decision 
by the assembly? 
  [Figueres] I do not think so. Our legislative branch is 
independent of the executive branch. I can contribute my grain 
of sand so that things in Central America will go as well as 
possible within the legislative sphere. Certain sectors in 
Costa Rica oppose joining the Central American Parliament, 
however, and I hope that as time passes we will gradually defeat 
that position. I will not engage in that debate for now; we 
must progress in other issues, an attitude which is much more 
positive and constructive. 
  [Reyes] In conclusion, Mr. Figueres, did the Honduran 
president confirm to you and your entourage he will attend your 
inauguration on 8 May? 
  [Figueres] He did, and I am very pleased and satisfied over 
that. 
  [Reyes] A final word for the Honduran people? 
  [Figueres] A strong embrace, a warm greeting, and wishes of 
success for the four years that lie ahead. Costa Rica will 
always be at your service to help as much as it can, be it a 
little or much. [end recording]
