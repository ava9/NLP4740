FT  09 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Central America's 'model' accord - An
'advanced' trade deal between Mexico and Costa Rica

The free trade agreement that Mexico and Costa Rica provisionally concluded
last week has been described as the most advanced between two Latin American
countries.
It will eventually remove tariff and most non-tariff barriers to trade in
goods and services between the two countries; offer national treatment to
investors from each country; set rules on intellectual property rights; ease
movement of workers between the two countries; and provide for a panel that
resolves disputes arising out of compliance with the accord.
Both countries predicted that the agreement would significantly boost
Mexican-Costa Rican trade, which stood at Dollars 215m (Pounds 147.2m) last
year.
However, by giving preferential access to each other's markets, the
agreements will hurt the two countries' existing trade partners, especially
other central American states.
The negotiations were formally wrapped up last Thursday night, and the text
is being written up by lawyers. Mexico's Trade Ministry expects the
agreement to be ready in four to six weeks and to be signed by the
respective presidents soon after.
The treaty will take effect from January 1 next year. Mexico's Trade
Ministry said Mexican exports of goods that Costa Rica did not produce would
be able to enter Costa Rica duty-free from next year. This covers about 80
per cent of Mexican exports, currently at tariffs of about 20 per cent.
Tariffs on the remainder of Mexican exports will be reduced over five, 10
and - for the most sensitive products - 15 years. Mexico in turn will allow
a majority of Costa Rican exports to enter duty-free in five years or less.
Mr Jaime Serra Puche, Mexico's trade minister, said the agreement was '. . .
without a doubt, one of the most advanced trade agreements between any Latin
American countries'.
He said the pact established 'a strong rule of origin that requires goods to
be made with inputs of the region; that is to say from Costa Rica or Mexico,
and that this is an important opportunity for Mexican suppliers of inputs
and primary materials, since Costa Rica's supply industry is not well
advanced'.
Mr Roberto Rojas, Costa Rica's trade minister, described the pact as the
first step toward Costa Rica's accession to the North American Free Trade
Agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada.
An official from Mexico's Trade Ministry said products would have to contain
50 per cent regional content to be considered Costa Rican or Mexican and
free of tariffs. As Mr Serra Puche made clear, such a rule of origin would
encourage Costa Rican companies that export to Mexico to source from Mexico
rather than neighbouring countries.
'What this accord is promoting is alliances and not competition between
Mexico and Costa Rica,' said the official. 'What we are looking for is that
Costa Rican and Mexican businessmen work together.'
This is the latest of a series of trade agreements in Latin America. Trade
experts from the region meeting in Santiago last week were warned in a
report from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America that there were
risks in such agreements, in particular bilateral ones.
It said the benefits of such deals 'were fewer when integration agreements
involve countries that are only minor trading partners'. It argued there was
a 'possibility that bilateral (or even broader) integration agreements
signed within the region might have restrictive effects'.
With low tariffs such as those that prevail in Latin America, the benefits
of such trade agreements were fewer, it said, and the accords could include
other aspects - such as rules of origin - that might discourage trade rather
than promote it.
It further suggested that the emergence of certain 'hub' countries, with
which most bilateral agreements were concluded, 'can also create incentives
for the polarisation of investment in these countries'.
Mr Serra Puche hoped the agreement with Costa Rica would provide a model for
similar accords between Mexico and remaining central American countries,
over which negotiations were continuing.
Mexico's trade minister expects to meet this month with counterparts from
Colombia and Venezuela to discuss their free trade agreement. The three
countries had hoped to sign the treaty in January before President Rafael
Caldera of Venezuela took office. Although Mexico claimed in December that
negotiations had concluded, last-minute differences over rules or origin for
chemicals and textiles made signing impossible, however.
The new Venezuelan government, less keen on free trade than its predecessor,
is said to have insisted on a re-negotiation of the treaty. The Mexican
government is willing to meet the Venezuelans and listen to their concerns,
but the Trade Ministry official said the agreement could not be re-opened.
