  [Text] Taipei, May 4 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui left 
for Nicaragua Wednesday [4 May] morning on the first day of his 
13-day, four-country overseas tour. 
  During the next two weeks, Li will pay official visits to 
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, South Africa, and Swaziland. All four 
countries maintain close official relations with the Republic of 
China [ROC]. 
  Traveling with Li are Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu, 
Governor of the Central Bank of China Samuel Shieh, Chairman of 
the Council for Economic Planning and Development Hsiao 
Wan-chang, Executive Yuan Advisor Jeffrey Koo, Presidential Vice 
Secretary-General Raymond Tai, and the directors of the Foreign 
Ministry's Central and South American Affairs Department Yen 
Ping-fan and African Affairs Department Du Ling. 
  Li will make a brief stopover in Hawaii to refuel before 
flying to Managua, Nicaragua. Chairman Natale Bellocchi of the 
American Institute in Taiwan will meet Li in Hawaii during the 
stopover. 
  Li is scheduled to arrive in Managua Wednesday afternoon. He 
will spend two days there. 
  Li will then fly to Costa Rica to attend the Sunday 
inauguration of President-Elect Jose Maria Figueres, and later 
fly to South Africa, where on May 10 he will attend the 
inauguration of newly-elected South African President Nelson 
Mandela. He will travel to Swaziland on May 11. 
  During his tour, Li will sign joint communiques with his 
counterparts in Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Swaziland to 
strengthen bilateral ties. 
  This will be Li's first official overseas tour since he 
assumed the presidency in 1988. He paid unofficial visits to 
Singapore in 1989 and to the Philippines, Indonesia, and 
Thailand in February this year. All four Southeast Asian 
countries recognize Beijing while maintaining close economic 
ties with Taiwan. 
  Li is scheduled to return to Taipei May 16.
