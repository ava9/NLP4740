  [Text] San Jose, 7 Apr (AFP) -- According to several 
government officials, following the signing of a free trade 
agreement with Mexico in Mexico City on Tuesday, 5 April, Costa 
Rica's priority is to become part of NAFTA before the rest of 
Central America. 
  Officials in both governments said that after three years of 
negotiations, Mexico and Costa Rica signed the "most advanced" 
commercial treaty in Latin America. The treaty will go into 
effect on 1 January, after it is ratified by both legislatures. 
  Costa Rican President-elect Jose Maria Figueres, a social 
democrat who will assume office on 8 May, noted that trade 
negotiations will be a priority for his administration in an 
effort to put his country on the political map of nations 
advancing toward regional integration. 
  The future president stressed the need to train experienced 
negotiators so they can make the best of the difficult trade 
negotiations ahead, particularly with a view to joining NAFTA, 
formed by Mexico, the United States, and Canada on 1 January. 
  Foreign Trade Minister Roberto Rojas, who has been 
responsible for trade negotiations so far, said that the 
agreement with Mexico puts Costa Rica in a "privileged" position 
for its integration into NAFTA. 
  "We would have liked to have signed a similar agreement with 
the rest of Central America, but that has been more difficult," 
the minister told a group of reporters. He added that before 
such an agreement can be signed, "the right internal, economic, 
and institutional conditions must exist, and Costa Rica found 
them" in the negotiations with Mexico. 
  According to Rojas, it would take approximately 10 years to 
join NAFTA if the negotiations were carried out in concert with 
the other Central American nations, and he predicted that it 
will take two years for Costa Rica to sign a free trade 
agreement with the rest of Central America. 
  The treaty with Mexico gives Costa Rica access to a market 
30 
times larger than the Costa Rican market. Business associations 
and government officials expect a significant boost in foreign 
investment and commercial trade, which currently represents a 
deficit for Costa Rica. 
  In 1993, Costa Rica exported approximately $60 million and 
imported $150 million, mostly in oil purchases, from Mexico. 
  Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani said on Wednesday 
that 
it was "excellent" that Costa Rica had signed the agreement 
because it can serve as an example for the other countries in 
the region, which are currently in preliminary negotiations with 
Mexico. 
  Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua form the 
Central America 4 (CA-4) group, which must set a date in the 
next few weeks for the next summit of heads of state to discuss 
the continuation of trade talks with Mexico. 
  These countries agreed on the joint negotiation of a free 
trade agreement with Mexico. Efforts in this direction have 
also been made in Nicaragua, where authorities have expressed 
their desire to sign the agreement this year. 
  The subject was included on President Violeta Chamorro's 
agenda during her official visit to Mexico, which concluded on 
Wednesday. Nicaragua maintains modest trade with Mexico and owes 
that nation nearly $1 billion, half of which is for oil imports.
