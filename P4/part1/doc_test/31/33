  [Text] San Jose, 1 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican President 
Rafael Angel Calderon today emphasized his country's high 
economic growth rate, low inflation rate, and reduced poverty 
and described the Free Trade Agreement [TLC] with Mexico as one 
of the greatest achievements of his foreign policy. 
  In a report to the country entitled "Roads of Prosperity" 
read during a solemn session of the Legislative Assembly, the 
president said: "Our economic strategy allowed us to defeat 
inflation and the high cost of living." 
  To illustrate the apparent success of his administration, 
Calderon cited figures such as an increase in GNP from 6.5 
percent in 1992 to 7.7 percent in 1993 following a severe 
adjustment at the beginning of his government. 
  Calderon, who will turn over the presidency to Jose Maria 
Figueres of the Social Democratic Party next Sunday, said in 
this, his last report to the nation, that during his four-year 
term exports increased by 60 percent and reached $2.667 billion 
last year. He also said that the fiscal deficit, which stood at 
7.5 percent when he took office, was reduced to less than 1 
percent last year and inflation was reduced to 9 percent, the 
lowest in the past 15 years. 
  Calderon said that, contrary to what several sectors say 
about the country's alleged impoverishment, unemployment was 
reduced to 4 percent -- one of the lowest unemployment rates on 
the continent -- and poverty to less than 17 percent, three 
points less than when he assumed office. He also emphasized 
the growth of tourism, which is expected to become the primary 
source of foreign exchange this year, and housing programs, 
which led to the construction of 96,000 homes in four years. 
"The economic reform sponsored by this administration made it 
possible to release resources that were used in social programs. 
Thanks to this, Costa Rica remains an example of social and 
human development in Latin America," he said. 
  Regarding criticism for an alleged disregard of foreign 
policy, Calderon stressed "an active diplomacy" in favor of 
democracy and respect for human rights. In this connection, he 
recalled Costa Rica's participation in the crises in Haiti, 
Peru, and Guatemala. "Throughout these years, we contributed to 
the reaffirmation of processes for peace, democratization, and 
integration in Central America," he said, adding that the 
signing of the TLC between Costa Rica and Mexico is one of his 
administration's greatest achievements in the international 
field. 
  This commercial treaty, which will go into effect in January 
after it is ratified by the legislatures of the two countries, 
will permit the trade of 12,000 products. Costa Rica will be 
able to triple its exports to Mexico in the next two years. 
Such exports now reach barely $60 million, according to 
government and private enterprise calculations. 
  "Whatsoever a man soweth he shall also reap. Costa Rica has 
sown and is now reaping," the president said. Calderon will 
become part of the opposition on 8 May with one of the highest 
popularity levels a president has ever attained at the time of 
his departure from office. 
  During the early months of his government, Calderon 
implemented a severe economic adjustment program that led to 
higher public services rates, higher staple prices, a higher 
inflation rate, and low economic growth, a little over 2 
percent, in 1990. In this last report, however, he said: "We 
are enjoying the first fruits of a time of prosperity. We 
turned obstacles into solutions, obstructions into channels, and 
setbacks into victories. But we are just at the beginning of 
the road."
