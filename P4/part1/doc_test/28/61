<P>
Heart surgeon Denton A. Cooley is best known for the world's first successful 
artificial heart implant and the first successful heart transplant performed in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He also has charted new medical business territory, with packaged pricing at 
discount rates for heart operations and cardiovascular treatments. 
</P>
<P>
Others are following his example. 
</P>
<P>
The Texas Heart Institute, a research organization Cooley founded in 1962 and 
the base of his heart surgery team of six, signed its first contract with 
Tenneco, a Houston oil company, six years ago. It has since negotiated 22 
contracts with corporations and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
Cooley said his version of discount heart surgery has been inspired mostly by a 
desire to offer quality care at affordable fees. 
</P>
<P>
"The medical directors of corporations and insurance companies need help 
evaluating the care people are receiving," Cooley said. "I wanted to give them 
a package at a reasonable cost. I wanted to help eliminate abuse from the 
health care system." 
</P>
<P>
Such deals also help Cooley and others who contract out, partly because they 
keep their operating rooms full. 
</P>
<P>
"If you do a high volume of heart surgery, you can do it less expensively, and 
you can do it better," said Jeff Goldsmith, a national adviser on medical care 
to the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young. 
</P>
<P>
Packaged pricing is competitive with the growing number of hospitals offering 
complicated procedures such as organ transplants. For employers, the motivation 
for choosing recognized leaders is the old idea that "practice makes perfect." 
</P>
<P>
The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., known for its diagnostic capabilities, 
sold its first package deal for organ transplants to the Mutual of Omaha 
insurance company.
