<P>
Doctors performing a historic liver transplant operation involving a living 
donor today accidentally damaged the donor's spleen and were forced to remove 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The spleen of Terri Smith, 29, of Schertz, Tex., was damaged as doctors removed 
a portion of her liver to implant in her 21-month-old daughter, Alyssa, who 
suffers from biliary atresia, a spokesman for the University of Chicago 
Hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
A retractor came loose during surgery and hit the spleen, said Dr. Peter 
Whitington, director of pediatric transplant services. The spleen was then 
removed, forcing a delay in preparations for Alyssa's surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of the spleen will not adversely affect Smith, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said they expect the surgery on the youngster to continue into the 
evening.
