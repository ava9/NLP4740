Noemi Serrano laughs and smiles, exuberant in her youth, optimistic even in the 
face of illness. 
</P>
<P>
It is almost Christmas, she says, a time to be thankful for the family and the 
gift of life. But doctors say the 18-year-old Buena Park resident is in 
desperate need of a heart and lung transplant, and her friends have rallied 
around her in a drive to raise enough money to make sure that finances do not 
stand in her way. 
</P>
<P>
Diagnosed as having pulmonary hypertension, Noemi first noticed the symptoms in 
1987 while visiting relatives in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't walk around and do things like everyone else. At first I 
thought that I was just lazy, and then I remembered that a few months before 
that I was getting really tired in physical education and when I walked to 
school," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Taken to a cardiologist in Mexico by her grandfather, she learned that there 
was a problem with her heart. Her family immediately returned to California and 
took her to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where doctors confirmed that her 
blood pressure was dangerously high and that she needed a heart and lung 
transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford University and UCLA will place Serrano on the waiting list for a 
suitable transplant if she can raise $25,000 toward the estimated $100,000 cost 
of the surgery. The remainder will be paid off in installments. 
</P>
<P>
The Buena Park Firemen's Assn. has started a trust fund in the amount of $5,000 
and is urging residents to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
Living in a modest home with her mother and father, the oldest of four brothers 
and two sisters, Serrano says her days consist of doing her home studies and 
watching television. Because of all the time she missed in school because of 
her illness, Serrano was unable to graduate with her class at Buena Park High 
School in June but hopes to finish in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
Noemi's mother, Soledad, speaks no English but said through an interpreter that 
"the hardest part of the situation is when Noemi has to be hospitalized." The 
latest hospitalization came earlier this week when her blood pressure dropped 
far below normal. 
</P>
<P>
Friends drop by once in a while to visit, but Noemi notes that it is hard for 
them to see her ill. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems so difficult that this should be happening to someone they know," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing Noemi plans to do when she gets healthy again -- and she has no 
doubt that she will -- is to "go back to Mexico and finish that vacation." 
</P>
<P>
Donations can be made by sending checks payable to the Noemi Serrano 
Trust/BPFA, Buena Park Credit Union, 6650 Beach Blvd., Buena Park, Calif., 
90620. -- DEBORAH CARPENTIER
