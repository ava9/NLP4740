lesss impressive than it seems

MISS Yoko Hirokawa, a 19 year old student, is one of many Japanese patients
who have received liver transplant operations in Australia.
She went there because of the lack of fresh organs to be used in
transplants. This is due to the Japanese law which refuses to define
brain-dead persons, the principal source of transplant organs, as legally
dead.
However, although parliament is discussing a redefinition of death to allow
organ transplants in Japan, the country's healthcare system may stand in the
way of such innovative treatments.
Miss Hirokawa had her operation only after raising ADollars 140,000 through
donations and loans not covered by Japan's insurance. Such costs mean that
even when transplants are approved in Japan, only those who can afford such
services will be treated.
The Japanese system assures broad access to care as well as low fees through
cost sharing and government negotiated fees for services and supplies.
However, rigid cost control methods cause mounting frustration for patients.
In theory, all Japanese are covered either through company plans or national
health insurance. In the US, on the other hand, 13 to 15 per cent of
citizens have no health insurance at any one time.
At present, 31.4 per cent of health care costs in Japan are met by central
and municipal governments, 56.3 per cent by the premium payers, which
includes employers, and 12.1 per cent by the patient.
Comparing Japan's longevity and infant mortality rates with those in the US,
the Japanese system may seem superior. In Japan, the life expectancy for men
is 76 years and for women 82 years, compared with 72 for men and 78.8 for
women in the US.
The infant mortality rate is 4.6 per 1,000 live births in Japan, exactly
half the US rate.
However, a visit to a Japanese hospital for treatment reveals the negative
side of this apparently impressive health system.
The hospital is probably dingy and the patient will have to wait for over an
hour in a crowded waiting room before seeing a doctor.
There is little interaction between patient and doctor. Instead, the patient
will be dismissed with a long list of drugs, prescribed with scant
explanation of his illness or of the nature of the medication.
Such procedures stem partly from the heavy cost controls which militate
against new procedures and technology.
The fee structure is determined in detail every two years by the Central
Social Medical Care Council in the light of financial reviews of hospitals
and clinics and the types and frequency of medical treatment.
This helps to prevent sharp increases in costs, but also tends to stultify
medical services.
According to Pat Murdo, analyst at Japan Economic Institute in Washington
DC, the council curbs costs by delaying approval to pay for new procedures
and technologies.
The delays have the advantage of ensuring that the government has time to
ensure the effectiveness of new techniques. But critics fear that delays in
diffusing new methods work to the detriment of patients who cannot afford to
pay privately for life-saving treatments.
Emphasis on cheaper primary treatment also helps doctors to identify
symptoms before they turn into serious ailments. But such controls result in
low quality service which most patients face - long waiting lists and
limited communication with the physician.
Meanwhile, as doctors are reimbursed for the drugs that they prescribe, they
tend to overdispense. In 1991, drug costs in Japan comprised 42.7 per cent
of total medical costs; in the UK they were only 11.7 per cent and in the US
only 9.3 per cent.
At the same time, recent efforts by the Ministry of Health and Welfare to
cut official costs of older, less innovative drugs have resulted in the
prescription of new drugs, especially antibiotics.
The rigid reimbursement system also fails to address the wage increases and
demands for shorter working hour by medical staff. Iroren - the Japan
Federation of Medical Workers' Unions - asserts that medical staff are
'overburdened and scarcely able to maintain normal life and health' due to
restrictions in the growth of health care costs.
In Japan, there are 33.6 nurses to 100 beds, compared with 40.2 in the UK
and 55.1 in the US.
According to Iroren, 60 per cent of health workers work more than six night
shifts a month, with the medical staff working an average of nine night
shifts.
Further technological advances in treatment and the ageing of the population
may eventually prove too much for the health system.
