New York City is planning to throw a big anniversary party for George 
Washington. In fact, Mayor Edward I. Koch promised that the ceremonies to mark 
the 200th anniversary of the inauguration of the nation's first President will 
be "bigger, bigger, bigger" than other recent celebrations, including the 
centennial tribute to the Statue of Liberty in 1986. "This is the most 
appropriate place to celebrate this historic anniversary, because New York City 
was the first capital of the United States under the Constitution," Koch said 
at a news conference in Federal Hall, where Washington was sworn in on April 
30, 1789, and where Congress met for the first time. Organizers have invited 
President Reagan, President-elect Bush and former Presidents Jimmy Carter, 
Gerald R. Ford and Richard M. Nixon to attend the observance on April 29 and 
30. Events will include fireworks, a parade of 13 Navy and Coast Guard ships 
representing the original colonies, an ecumenical service in St. Paul's Chapel 
on Lower Broadway, where Washington attended religious services after his 
inauguration, a parade up Broadway and an inaugural gala dinner.

 -- Young Stormie Jones, the world's first recipient of a simultaneous heart 
and liver transplant, was reported to be in good condition after a checkup at 
Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pa. Stormie, 11, of White Settlement, Tex., 
had undergone blood tests in Texas that found elevated levels of body toxins 
the liver should be removing, said hospital spokeswoman Lynn McMahon. Doctors 
performed Stormie's transplant at Children's Hospital in February, 1984, 
because she suffered from hyper-cholesterolemia, which causes fat to accumulate 
in the blood. She returned last October for bile duct reconstruction. McMahon 
said it was not yet clear if her new symptoms are related to the bile duct 
problem.

 -- Elena Ceausescu is more than the First Lady of Romania. Now the wife of 
President Nicolae Ceausescu is officially a national heroine, the Agerpres 
agency said. She was awarded the title "Heroine of the Socialist Republic of 
Romania" at a special luncheon marking her 70th birthday, attended by leading 
Communist Party officials. Elena Ceausescu, a prominent member of the Romanian 
Politburo, is regarded by many Western diplomats as second-in-command to her 
husband. Agerpres said party officials praised her activity in the country's 
underground movement during World War II. SHIRLEY MARLOW
