An 11,000-acre wildfire continued to rage out of control in San Diego County 
Friday night and firefighters in Los Angeles County responded to a new blaze 
that had threatened homes in the San Gabriel Mountains north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The fire near Mt. Palomar in San Diego County was reported 60% contained, but 
U.S. Forest Service officials said temperatures in the 90s, low humidity, heavy 
brush and the steep terrain of the Cleveland National Forest were hampering the 
efforts of nearly 2,000 Forest Service, state Division of Forestry and military 
firefighters to control the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Few fire roads penetrate the mountainous area where the fire has burned for a 
week, and fire crews had to be airlifted by helicopter or march in on foot to 
reach some of the hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 of the firefighters were deployed around homes and the observatory 
atop Mt. Palomar, where astronomers closed the big dome last Saturday to 
protect the 200-inch mirror of one of the world's largest telescopes from 
drifting ash. On Thursday, the rest of the complex was closed. 
</P>
<P>
Forest Service Capt. Jim Van Meter said the deployment at Mt. Palomar was 
largely precautionary. The flames were at one point about two miles away but 
turned in another direction late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to panic people, because there's no reason to panic," Van Meter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred visitors were evacuated from camps on the flanks of the 
mountain, but officials said none of the camp structures appeared to be in 
immediate danger. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, a fast-moving blaze burned at least 500 acres and for 
several hours threatened about 400 homes in the community of Green Valley, 
about 50 miles north of Los Angeles in the Angeles National Forest. At one 
point, flames burned to within 100 yards of some of the homes before being 
beaten back. 
</P>
<P>
About 350 county firefighters and 100 Forest Service personnel were moved in to 
battle the fire, which broke out at about 11:15 a.m. near San Francisquito 
Canyon Road, about a mile south of town. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Soto, a county fire investigator, said the fire was about 50% contained by 
nightfall and appeared to be burning away from the community.
