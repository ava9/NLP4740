Heir Sues Lawyers for Representing Mother: Oil heir Howard B. Keck Jr., scion 
of an eminent philanthropic family, filed a malpractice suit against his 
lawyers, claiming their representation of his mother in her divorce is likely 
to dilute his expected inheritance. The Los Angeles Superior Court suit stems 
from the divorce battle of Elizabeth Avery Keck and Howard B. Keck Sr., whose 
father founded Superior Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks unspecified damages because the Los Angeles firm of Trope &amp; 
Trope, in representing Mrs. Keck, allegedly used "confidential information" it 
learned while representing Keck's son for 20 years. The younger Keck says his 
inheritance could be reduced if his mother prevails in her divorce battle. The 
firm denies a conflict of interest. (Filed April 30, 1990. Case No. C759915)
