Spain - Audrey Powell finds evidence of a trend away from the coast

THE Property Misdescriptions Act, which begins to bite this weekend, should
curb the imagination of British estate agents when drafting particulars of
UK houses and flats. But what of properties abroad?
Do not expect any changes in that respect. While British property can no
longer be 'peacefully located' with a busy railway at the bottom of the
garden - unless the agent is willing to chance a heavy fine - it appears
that the Spanish villa advertised in his other window can retain its
'peaceful location' beside the notorious Malaga coast road without any risk
of action.
Still, the recession seems to have gone some way to making agents keep
closer to fact (or perhaps those most economical with the truth are not
around any more). Much overseas property is good value for today's money and
there is no point in agencies pretending people are queueing to buy when
everyone knows how things really are. So, when one says there is 'an element
of movement' in the Spanish market, it is probably fair comment.
There is a movement in choice of location, too. A trend is developing
towards looking for properties away from the coast, although this is not
everyone's ideal.
Naomi Greatbanks, of Hamptons (071-493 8222), says: 'There are really good
deals to be had and I think things have just about bottomed-out now.' The
agency has sold four homes on the El Chaparral golf development in the past
few weeks. This is a project by a Bristol-based British builder at Mijas
Costa, in pine-covered hills between Marbella and Fuengirola.
There is an 18-hole course and a range of properties and prices. You might
get a villa for Pounds 250,000 or Pounds 400,000; apartments at Pounds
80,000 or Pounds 108,000. Density is low, with winding valleys giving all
the properties views of the course and the Mediterranean.
Views of the sea and surrounding mountains are a feature of a villa on a
hill, surrounded by pine woods, east of Marbella. The property is built as a
spiral and integrated into the hillside.
The sitting room has a curved seating area around a central fireplace, which
forms the hub from which ceiling beams stretch out like the spokes of a
wheel. There are four en-suite bedrooms, staff accommodation, gardens,
terraces and a large pool. Price: Pounds 920,000. Details from Sotheby's
(071-408 5196).
North, in the Costa Brava, prices are much lower and are still being slashed
as developers wait for confidence to return. IPI, of Brighton (0273-774
098), has two-bedroom golf penthouse apartments with terrace pool, close to
the beach at Pals, reduced from Pounds 115,000 to Pounds 74,250. Or you can
take your pick of waterfront apartments overlooking the marina at L'Escala
from Pounds 43,250.
Heading inland, Costa Blanca Villas, an agency in Oxfordshire (0235-772
345), says it has discovered that 'there is a huge demand for property in
Spain away from urbanisations.' It has properties in the Cocentaina hills,
near Alcoy, about an hour's drive from Alicante.
The houses, all different, are old and suited for buyers who want the simple
life. Small windows keep them cool and, in many cases, they have been
unchanged internally for 50 years: one visitor described them as like a time
capsule. The attraction is far views of mountains and valleys.
Prices start around Pounds 20,000, while Pounds 45,000 buys a three-bedroom
country house in an acre, with olive and almond trees and a swimming pool.
But the agency warns: 'A basic knowledge of Spanish, and a desire to be away
from it all, are an advantage for those considering investment in this
area.'
The far north of Spain is an area explored only occasionally by
house-hunters. Bradley &amp; Vaughan, in Sussex (0444-412 551), has property in
what it calls a non-tourist region centred on Tremp, south-west of Andorra,
in the Pyrenees.
The scenery is unusual - lakes and valley running through a plain - and
there are plenty of cheap village houses to be had, but the agency
recommends a mill that was converted by a chartered surveyor, with three
bedrooms and a dining/living room. The grinding equipment has been kept as a
feature and there is a barn for conversion. This, in half an acre, is Pounds
73,000.
The local shepherd - who might share his flask of wine with the visitor -
drives his sheep past the property and keeps an eye on it. Allow a day, or
preferably two, to drive down from the Channel coast.
Another area not much publicised in Spain is Galicia, in the north-west
above Portugal. It is quite a wealthy area, with some interesting
properties, says Somerset agent Babet (0460-76 213). The best way to get
there is to fly to Santiago de Compostela airport, which has direct flights
from Heathrow.
Typical of the many properties available to renovate is a 250-year-old
cottage with barn, overlooking a valley and priced around Pounds 22,000.
Rather different is a 90-acre country estate near the yachting centre of
Baiona. There are views across the bay on one side, and of mountains and
forest on the other. Here, there is a private country club and executive
town houses priced from Pounds 138,000.
Back on the better-known Costa del Sol, agent Barbara Wood, at Guadalmina
(95.288.37.10), will do her best to dispose of country idyll ideas. 'People
dream of living in the hills,' she says. 'But you have to speak Spanish. It
is jolly cold in winter. You have to come down to town to buy everything.
It's a lovely thought but a world apart from reality . . .'
Wood says her 'best buy' at the moment, offered in association with Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629 8171), is an unusual hilltop property at Mijas which
was finished last year and is being sold by its German owner.
The circular house is in a walled circular garden amid avocado groves; from
the air, it looks like a bull ring. There are four family suites, staff
quarters and a triple swimming pool. Wood describes it as a house 'for the
guy who is trying to say he has arrived.' Price: Pounds 1.6m.
