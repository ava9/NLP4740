ALTHOUGH the 550-acre Praia d'el Rey estate, on the coast north of Lisbon,
is almost entirely a new development, permission for building there actually
was given before Portugal's bloodless revolution in the 1970s. The site is
near the old walled village of 0bidos and its lagoon, and the fishing port
of Peniche.
Initially, a few houses were built by a Belgian company which used to own
the land. Then, the project was shelved. But it has been revived by its new
owner, Beltico, a consortium which includes Portuguese and British partners.
Plans envisage housing, three hotels, a village, and an 18-hole golf course
and clubhouse.
About 30 villas - many substantial - have been, or are being, built. Roofs
are pink-tiled, usually on several levels, and walls are cream or white.
Nearly all have swimming pools, some have tennis courts, and most will have
views of the sea, golf course or nearby woodland.
A few are only 50 yards from the beach, part of Portugal's 'silver coast'
where Atlantic waves roll onto the soft sand and send up fountains of spray.
Other buyers, preferring larger plots, have chosen sites farther back
looking into the woods. Indeed, some have bought two or three.
Initial purchasers have come from Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and
Britain. but a number are Portuguese. This pleases the developers because
such owners are likely to make frequent use of the properties. They may even
commute to Lisbon, 80 minutes' drive away (although this will be cut to
under an hour when new roads are completed). Thus, the estate should have
occupants throughout the year.
When completed, there will be about 150 villas, 800 town houses and 600
apartments, mostly in the cobbled village which will form a corner of the
site. The price for a two-bedroom apartment could be Pounds 50,000, with two
or three bedroom town houses from Pounds 80,000. A four-bedroom detached
villa, with pool, could cost about Pounds 200,000, depending on site and
plot size.
Golfers will enjoy what is almost a links course, part of which will run
parallel with the sea with the rest spreading back over sand dunes and
moorland into pine woods. Work on the course - designed by an American,
Cabell Robinson - is just starting and should take 18 months. There is a
chance there could be a second course later. For further information in
Lisbon, call Beltico (tel. 315 76 07). In London, ring solicitor Swycher &amp;
Co. (071-224-3388); its senior partner is a director of the consortium.
Praia d'el Rey is just one of several golf schemes in the Iberian peninsula,
despite the recession. London &amp; Edinburgh Trust's LET Leisure has acquired
the controlling interest in Pinheiros Altos, a 250-acre golf course
development adjoining the Quinta do Lago estate in the Algarve of southern
Portugal.
The first batch of 9l villa plots is being offered there at prices between
Pounds 85,000-Pounds 240,000. Buyers can then choose from a selection of
house designs or use their own architect. Total cost could average Pounds
350,000-Pounds 400,000.
The course - designed by another American, Ronald Fream - will have a
computerised booking system and rounds will be limited to four hours. The
first nine holes should be ready by June, with the rest playable in the
autumn. Plot buyers will have guaranteed membership of the club and priority
access to its golf academy. Details from LET Leisure at 071-602-9922.
Another development on the Algarve for golfers is Vila Sol at Morgadinhos,
near Vilamoura, 20 minutes from Faro airport. This estate is similar to
Praia d'el Rey in that earlier work was halted by the revolution. In this
case, though, the new owner has built the 18-hole course first. Designed by
an Englishman, Donald Steel, and completed last year, it occupies a third of
the 367 acres and the Portuguese Open was played on it last month. Vila Sol
is thought to be the first course in Portugal built to United States Golf
Association standards.
The next stage is the housing. The 240 plots, of a quarter or half an acre,
encircle the course and the first are now being offered at between Pounds
67,000-Pounds 279,000. Villas will have views of the fairways or distant
mountains. The estimated cost of building a suitable three-bedroom design,
with pool, on such a plot is about Pounds 150,000. Buyers may choose from
various available plans or appoint their own architect, but he must conform
to development guidelines.
There are to be apartments and a five-star hotel on the northern boundary. A
business centre, clinic and leisure area for activities like tennis and
riding will come later. The development is a little away from the coast and
this, it is claimed, will make it more secluded. But it also has a private
beach club, with restaurant and bar, at Ancao beach and a regular shuttle
service will link the two.
Vila Sol is backed by the Grupo Atlantica, a Portuguese financial
institution which, among other interests, is a shareholder in the Banco
Totta &amp; Acores. The UK agent is Hamptons (071-493-8222).
The recent DRT International survey of European golf facilities shows that
Portugal has 20 courses, with 14 more being built and 90 projects under
consideration. Sandy Steven, of the Glasgow-based Tourism Resources Company
 -which studies the potential market for such facilities on behalf of
tourist organisations and developers - says that, despite the recession, the
luxury end of the market in Spain and Portugal is holding up, with demand
continuing for good-quality, low-density villas around courses.
