ALTHOUGH most estate agents agree that we are at the bottom of the
recession, the overhang of unsold properties means prices are unlikely to
soar next year, although some could rise as buyers compete for better
properties.
'It has been as difficult a year as I can remember, with very few buyers
around,' says James Laing of Strutt &amp; Parker.
In spite of this, Laing was involved in two of the most notable sales of the
year, both in Hampshire: the 2,000-acre Conholt Park estate, for which the
Dutch businessman Paul van Vlissingen paid Pounds 5.7m, and the 1,850-acre
West Tisted Manor estate, bought for more than Pounds 5m by a local family.
In spite of the Conservative election victory, it took Britain's departure
from the exchange rate mechanism to draw foreign buyers back to Britain, as
was demonstrated by three recent sales by Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. The
406-acre Sarsden House estate in Oxfordshire was sold to Mercedes-Benz heir
Mick Flick for more than Pounds 5m.
Grove House, a Nash villa in Regent's Park exquisitely restored by the
Australian businessman, the late Robert Holmes a Court, was sold for about
Pounds 12m to the Sultan of Oman.
Aberconway House in Mayfair, which failed to sell for Pounds 12.5m as
offices two years ago, was bought by the Emir of Qatar for about Pounds 5m.
'I think we are at the bottom of the recession,' says Patrick Ramsay, of
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. 'I am optimistic about the market next year. There is
no good financial reason for potential purchasers to wait any longer.'
Geoffrey van Cutsem, of Savills, adds: 'The only way is up, but it will be a
desperately slow recovery. If anything, prices are too low now, and we may
see some gazumping as buyers who have been sitting on the sidelines decide
to come back into the market.'
This year, properties on the market frequently had only one serious bidder,
but when Humberts sold Knoyle Place, at East Knoyle, Wiltshire, this summer
six people were willing to pay more than the asking price of Pounds 1m.  The
18th century house incorporates a 17th-century rectory in which Christopher
Wren spent the first three years of his life. A sale was concluded at about
Pounds 1.2m.
That was also the price paid for the Lycett-Green's 200-acre Manor Farm at
Huish, on the edge of the Wiltshire Downs. When Savills put this property on
the market in September, inviting offers of more than Pounds 1m, it
attracted seven serious bidders who were invited to a private auction.
The only stately home sold this year was Brympton d'Evercy, the Grade I
listed Tudor house near Yeovil, Somerset, which had been in Charles
Clive-Ponsonby-Fane's family since 1731. Realistically priced when it was
placed on the market in June with 25 acres, it attracted considerable
interest and was sold for more than Pounds 850,000.
As the year draws to an end, Strutt &amp; Parker is expecting to announce the
sale of the late Jim Joel's Childwick Bury Stud in Hertfordshire and the
historic Herstmonceaux Castle estate in Sussex, where it is acting for the
receivers of James Developments.
Savills expects to announce thesale of Chandlings Manor, an Oxfordshire
farmhouse extended at a cost of several millions by a Lebanese businessman,
Farid Wakim, who has since died, into a property that Leisure Investments
had agreed to buy for Pounds 5.4m when it went into liquidation in 1990.
Sold by the receivers in 1991 for Pounds 2.5m, it came back on the market
three months ago priced at Pounds 1.95m.
A sale appropriate for the season was made by Viscount Esher, former
president of the Royal Institute of British Architects. He sold Christmas
Common Tower, the four-storey house he built 25 years ago in Old Deer Park,
Watlington, Oxfordshire, for Pounds 350,000 through Knight Frank &amp; Rutley
and Hamptons. It had been on the market for about six months.
