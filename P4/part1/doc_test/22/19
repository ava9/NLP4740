A member of the legendary gang that carried out Britain's Great Train Robbery 
of 1963 was shot to death in this Costa del Sol resort, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe the killing of Charles Wilson, 58, may have been 
drug-related, a Marbella police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
A gunmen opened fire Monday afternoon on Wilson after calling at the door of 
the Briton's apartment, the spokesman said. Neighbors told police they spotted 
a young man in a track suit fleeing on a bicycle shortly after they heard the 
gunshots.

<P>
Wilson and 14 other members of a gang took part in the Great Train Robbery on 
Aug. 8, 1963, when they held up the Glasgow-to-London mail train. 
</P>
<P>
They stole 2.6 million pounds, then worth $7.2 million, in cash. At the time, 
it was the biggest robbery in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Police recovered less than $966,000, but Wilson and most of the other gang 
members were captured and jailed. Wilson was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 
1964 and released in 1978.
