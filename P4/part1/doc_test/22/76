FT  23 SEP 92 / Downing Street brushes aside Mellor ethics issue

DOWNING STREET last night brushed aside claims that Mr David Mellor, the
national heritage secretary, had breached the government's ethical
guidelines for ministers when he accepted hospitality from the daughter of a
leading Palestine Liberation Organisation member.
Officials said that as Mr Mellor had judged that his family's Marbella
holiday with Mrs Mona Bauwens in August 1990 did not breach the guidelines,
he was under no obligation to refer the decision upwards to the prime
minister.
However, Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow heritage secretary, claimed in a letter
to Mr John Major yesterday that the rules required that Mr Mellor should
have taken advice on the holiday, paid for by Mrs Bauwens.
The row followed the abandonment yesterday of a London libel case brought by
Mrs Bauwens against The People when the jury split evenly over whether her
reputation had been damaged by an article in the newspaper.
Mr Mellor, who has seen speculation that he might resign from the cabinet
rise strongly during the hearing, yesterday emphatically denied any plans to
quit.
Under the guidelines for ministers' behaviour made public on the
instructions of the prime minister this summer, the matter is left to 'the
good sense of ministers'. But it is also made clear that in grey areas, they
should seek the prime minister's advice.
The relevant sentence reads: 'It is a well established and recognised rule
that no minister or public servant should accept gifts, hospitality or
services from anyone who would, or might appear to, place him or her under
an obligation.'
Mrs Bauwens has fought her libel case in an effort to establish that her
father's role as a leading figure in the PLO has no bearing on her
reputation or public standing. Last night she was considering seeking a new
trial after the indecisive conclusion of the hung jury.
