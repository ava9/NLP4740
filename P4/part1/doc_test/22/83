Today is St George's Day, in honour of England's patron saint. It is also
said by many to be the anniversary of William Shakespeare's birth - and the
day he died. The greatest playwright in the English language was born at
Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, in 1564 and spent his early years there.
By the age of 30, he was established in London and a member of the Lord
Chamberlain's troupe, the capital's leading theatre company.
From 1599, he played in London's most magnificent new playhouse of the day,
the Globe in Southwark on the south bank of the river Thames. He retired to
Stratford and died there on April 23, 1616. The town celebrates him today -
as it does every April 23 - with civic pomp and a 'floral procession' to his
grave in Holy Trinity church.
Stratford has benefited enormously from the bard; without him, there would
be little of the tourist torrent that fills its coffers. There would be no
Royal Shakespeare Company and no memorial theatre where it performs. (A
summer evening treat is boating on the river Avon, ideal recuperation after
a matinee of Richard III.)
There would be far fewer shops, hotels, boarding houses and restaurants and
the home of his wife, Anne Hathaway, would be just another delightful Tudor
cottage. Nor would property prices carry the premium they do. In Stratford,
properties cost about 10 per cent more than in the rest of Warwickshire,
says James Way of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's branch in the town. Unfortunately,
there is a shortage of those pretty cottages and of good big houses.
Warwickshire's metropolis is Birmingham, Britain's second-biggest city. It
is a confusing place to drive around, so allow plenty of time for getting
lost if you do not know it and want to hear Simon Rattle conducting the City
of Birmingham symphony orchestra in the new Symphony Hall. (Alternatively,
hear them at the University of Warwick - which is in Coventry, and charges
less.) Among Birmingham's art galleries, do not miss the Barber Institute,
which has unusual works by well-known masters.
For the sporting, there are several football teams, cricket at Edgbaston or
golf at the challenging Belfry, UK venue of the Ryder Cup clashes with the
US. Inspect cars at the National Exhibition Centre or farm animals during
the Royal Agricultural Show at Stoneleigh.
Getting around Warwickshire is easy. There is the M40 that links the county
with Oxford and London; the M42 (Birmingham's eastern/southern ring road);
and the Fosse Way, the old Roman road which runs from Leicester to
Cirencester in Gloucestershire and slices through the south-east of the
county. Indeed, with most of Warwickshire not far from a motorway, this is
the navel of England.
Houses are mostly of brick as there is so much river clay. But on the
borders with Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire - the north end of the
Cotswolds - stone buildings appear. The best early brick building is
Charlecote Park which dates to the 1550s; Shakespeare is said to have
poached there.
Among brick houses for sale is Welford Hill House in Welford-on-Avon, a tall
Georgian farmhouse in 5.5 acres on higher ground with views over the Avon
valley as it meanders south-west of Stratford towards Evesham. The house
costs around Pounds 325,000 from Sedgwick Evans, which is also selling the
Mill House in the village beside a weir on the Avon for Pounds 300,000.
Other village houses in brick are the Pond House in Burmington, near
Shipston on Stour (for Pounds 320,000 from Seccombes or KFR); and Cotswolds
House at Newbold on Stour, with a handsome late-17th/18th century front
(Pounds 235,000 from KFR).
Two old stone houses are for sale in Warmington, an attractive village set
around a large sloping green on the county border north of Banbury. Savills
offers The Dene for Pounds 285,000 and Woodcote for Pounds 295,000.
Also in stone is the 1878 Salem Baptist Chapel in Little Compton, which
comes to auction - with planning permission for conversion - at 6pm on May 4
at The Fox pub in Chipping Norton (unless sold before). Joint auctioneers
John Hunt and Tayler &amp; Fletcher suggest a price of around Pounds 35,000 to
Pounds 40,000.
Howkins &amp; Harrison offers Willow Farm at Withybrook, near Rugby (which has a
good train service to London), at Pounds 220,000, while Bentley's Farmhouse
at Maxstoke, between Coventry and Birmingham, is Pounds 295,000.
The most interesting of the three is the grade II*-listed Corley Hall, near
Coventry, for Pounds 269,000. From the early 16th century, it has 17 carved
panels - mostly heads - of that date in an upstairs room.
Near Warwick, Stone Edge at Leek Wootton is a solid, early 20th century,
Lutyens-like house designed by H. Bulkeley Cresswell. At Pounds 495,000 from
Howkins &amp; Harrison, it suits a captain of industry.
If he prefers to live in Stratford, KFR offers 78 Tiddington Road for Pounds
590,000, while Sedgwick Evans has 67 Tiddington Road for Pounds 335,000.
Outside Stratford, Clifford Hill Court, in Clifford Chambers, is now Pounds
447,000 (from Pounds 475,000) with KFR. In Lower Quinton, a charming
half-timbered house made from four cottages costs Pounds 195,000 from
Sedgwick Evans.
