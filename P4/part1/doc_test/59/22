  [Text] Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, 22 January--Today, the 
Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR] and the 
Public Security Directorate of this municipality intercepted 
drugs worth $40 million on the international narcotics market. 
They consisted of 235 kg of pure cocaine and 137 kg of 
marijuana, which were seized today in two simultaneous 
operations conducted by the aforementioned forces, according to 
the Federal Judicial Police first commander, Jose Maria Barragan 
Barajas. 
  Based on the investigative report submitted to the agency of 
the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office [MPF], the first 
confiscation was made at the international bridge crossing to 
the United States, at Juarez Avenue. It occurred after three 
persons riding in separate vehicles following one another failed 
to meet their "contact," presumed to be an official of the 
neighboring northern country's government who was involved in 
the drug traffic, and who was to help them cross over to the 
United States. They decided to return with the alkaloid instead, 
prompting a pursuit by the Mexican police, who had been notified 
by the U.S. authorities. 
  Jaime Marquez, aged 18; Luis Miguel Martinez Garcia, 18; and 
Carlos Tapia Rodriguez, 19, the latter presumably related to a 
drug trafficking family of the same surname, were intercepted 
with the 235 kg of pure cocaine. They made their statements at 
the MPF, subordinate to the PGR. 
  Meanwhile, concurrently, the authorities captured a drug 
trafficker protecting himself with a reporter's credentials, who 
had managed to evade the Federal Judicial Police mobile units 
engaged in surveillance on the state's highways. This report was 
also made by Commander Jose Maria Barragan Barajas. 
  He explained that the subject under arrest, Juan Carlos 
Serafin Olvera, had identified himself with credentials of the 
newspaper DIARIO DE LA MANANA, and with a metal press badge. He 
was driving a cream-colored Ford Marquis vehicle with license 
plates DTM-1878, in which 137 kg of marijuana were found. 
  The aforementioned morning paper, which used to circulate in 
this border area and is not being published at present, was 
advertised on various parts of the confiscated vehicle. Found in 
the same car were three press credentials in the name of 
Salvador Noel Chacon Olguin, displayed in the rearview mirror 
and on the windshield so that the vehicle would not be stopped. 
  When presented to the news media, Serafin Olvera admitted 
that, after the closing of the newspaper DIARIO DE LA MANANA, 
where he had worked seven years as a police photographer, he 
began carrying marijuana from the Chihuahua capital to this 
locality. For each trip, he was being paid the sum of $1,000: 
$500 upon receiving the shipment, and another $500 when he 
delivered it. 
  The four persons arrested in the two police operations, as 
well as the cocaine and marijuana and the four luxury vehicles, 
were placed at the disposal of the acting agent of the Federal 
Public Prosecutor's Office.
