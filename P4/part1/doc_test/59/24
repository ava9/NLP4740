  [Text] As a result of the attacks by the Federal Judicial 
Police, who have dealt the drug traffic spectacular blows during 
recent months, with large seizures of marijuana, cocaine, and 
heroin, the criminal rings have opted to market synthetic drugs, 
such as "crack," "ice," and "ecstasy," which are cheaply priced. 
  Nevertheless, the PGR [Office of the Attorney General of the 
Republic] authorities warned that these chemical substances 
accelerate considerably the irreversible damage to the human 
body among persons consuming them. They are particularly harmful 
to the brain and other vital organs. 
  The office noted that the drug dealers, faced with the large 
confiscations made and the destruction of over a million 
marijuana and poppy crops, are known to have been forced to 
curtail their activities. They must now import most of their 
narcotics, including the synthetic types processed mainly in the 
United States. 
  By way of example, it mentioned the seizure of approximately 
70 kg of Thai heroin, discovered in offices of the Mexican 
Postal Service in Tijuana and Ensenada, Baja California. 
  It also gave a reminder of the interception, in the port of 
Manzanillo, Colima, of 10 tons of Colombian marijuana discovered 
in containers of vessels named Cordoba and Chimborazo. 
Furthermore, in Mazatlan, Sinaloa, the authorities confiscated a 
shipment of South American cocaine and cannabis indica worth 
millions. 
  It stressed that, because of their strong intoxicating 
power, 
the synthetic or laboratory-produced drugs cause irreversible 
damage to the human body, and that, as a rule, those using them 
become automatically addicted.
