  [Excerpt] Another severe blow was dealt to the drug traffic 
yesterday by the Attorney General's Office [PGR], when it seized 
five tons, 347 kg, and 800 grams of dried packed marijuana, 
worth over 90 million new pesos. In operations conducted in 
eight states, the Federal Judicial Police arrested 24 presumed 
drug dealers, also confiscating eight automotive vehicles used 
to transport drugs. 
  Among those arrested as persons presumed guilty of crimes 
against health were Urbano Barragan Ruiz, Javier Saldana 
Salazar, Lorena Salazar, Jose Israel Rueda Coria, Enrique 
Calderon Duarte, Jose Francisco Herrera, Jose Martin Ontiveros 
Galindo, Guadalupe Ontiveros Galindo, Jose Angel Limon Juarez, 
Jose Nieblas Chavez, Rafael Alcaraz Lopez, and Ignacio Torres 
Gil. 
  One of the largest seizures took place in Nuevo Leon, 
according to the report submitted by Roberto Soltero Acuna, the 
PGR's state representative, and Horacio Brun Acosta, deputy 
director of the Federal Judicial Police, on the confiscation of 
one ton and 512 kg of cannabis indica, which had arrived 
concealed in a tank truck. 
  Near km 145 of the Monterrey-Reynosa highway, Urbano 
Barragan 
Ruiz, driver of a 1986 Kenworth tractor-trailer truck with 
Federal Public Service license plates 256-AG9, was captured. The 
drugs were concealed in the "belly" of the tank, distributed in 
72 packages. 
  The vehicle was being guarded by Javier Saldana Salazar and 
Lorena Galvan, who were following the trailer in a Cheyenne 
pickup truck with Tamaulipas State registration VU-47085. 
  In their statements to the public ministry, the accused 
claimed that the drugs had been packed in Uruapan, Michoacan, 
and were bound for McAllen, Texas. 
  Another ton and 17 kg was seized in Sinaloa, specifically, 
in 
the municipality of Villa Union. Luis Antonio Cornejo, the PGR's 
state representative, reported that the drugs were being 
transported under a shipment of coconuts. At a checkpoint 
(Precos) set up on that site, the blue flatbed truck with plates 
350-AG3 was subjected to a search, and the illicit load was 
discovered. It had arrived from the municipality of Arteaga, 
Michoacan, with the town of Tijuana, Baja California, as its 
final destination. [passage omitted]
