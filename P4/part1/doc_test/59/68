Mexico City's current chief of police was present at one of the meetings where 
the kidnaping of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena was planned, federal 
prosecutors have alleged in court documents filed in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. prosecutors said Javier Garcia Paniagua was among 10 men -- ranging 
from drug traffickers to top Mexican law enforcement officials -- who met in 
Guadalajara in October, 1984, to discuss "a DEA agent that was causing 
significant problems," according to a prosecution document filed this week in 
preparation for a major trial involving four suspects indicted in Camarena's 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who has not been indicted in the Camarena case, was Mexico's secretary 
of state from 1976 to 1982 and later served as president of that country's 
leading political party, PRI. 
</P>
<P>
A controversial figure, Garcia is a former director of Mexico's federal 
security police, which has seen several of its officials implicated in drug 
trafficking. When he was appointed Mexico City's police chief in January, 1989, 
congressional sources in Washington and U.S. law enforcement agents on both 
sides of the border expressed dismay. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia could not be reached for comment Thursday, but Mexico's consul general 
in Los Angeles, Jose Angel Pescador Osuna, expressed surprise at the latest 
U.S. allegation. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never heard the name of Garcia Paniagua in this case," he said. "I don't 
know where they get this information. I am going to send this to Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure is likely to further inflame tensions between the United States 
and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials have claimed that a "rogue" unit in the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration orchestrated the April 2 kidnaping of a Guadalajara doctor, who 
was flown across the border by bounty hunters to face prosecution in the 
Camarena case. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's attorney general, Enrique Alvarez del Castillo, has continually 
maintained that all of the people responsible for Camarena's slaying have been 
brought to justice. About two dozen people have been convicted in Mexico of 
involvement in Camarena's abduction and murder. Three people are also serving 
jail terms in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The DEA has relentlessly pursued Camarena's killers, claiming that the 
conspiracy to kidnap the agent involved several former high-ranking Mexican law 
enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena, who worked undercover for the DEA, had incurred the wrath of Mexican 
drug kingpins by tipping authorities to vast marijuana fields in the Mexican 
countryside. A subsequent raid by authorities reputedly cost traffickers 
billions of dollars in lost street sales. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged plotters "agreed that something would have to be done about him," 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena was kidnaped off a Guadalajara street in February, 1985, and taken to 
a house owned by convicted drug trafficker Rafael Caro Quintero. He was 
interrogated and tortured. His mutilated body was found at a ranch 65 miles 
from Guadalajara a month later. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution memorandum submitted by assistant U.S. attorneys Manuel Medrano 
and John Carlton states that the meeting Garcia attended was the second of two 
gatherings held in October, 1984, at the home of Javier Barba Hernandez, who is 
identified as a chief lieutenant of the Guadalajara narcotics cartel. Barba was 
killed in a shoot-out with Mexican federal police last year. 
</P>
<P>
Also attending the meeting, according to the document, were Honduran drug 
kingpin Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros; Manuel Ibarra Herrera, former director of 
the Mexican federal security police; Miguel Aldana Ibarra, a former director of 
Interpol in Mexico; Caro Quintero; drug kingpin Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo; 
Mexican businessman Ruben Zuno Arce; Armando Pavon Reyes, Ibarra Herrera's 
chief aide, and drug trafficker Manuel Salcido. 
</P>
<P>
All but Salcido, who remains a fugitive on unrelated charges, and Garcia, have 
been indicted in the Camarena case. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys in the impending trial said this was the first time that 
Garcia's name has been raised in connection with the kidnaping and that no 
material on him had been turned over by prosecutors. "This raises more 
questions than it answers," one defense lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys were divided over the possibility that Garcia would testify 
at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
According to the new prosecution memo, there were a total of four meetings held 
to discuss what to do about Camarena. The only reference to Garcia is that he 
attended the second meeting. 
</P>
<P>
At the third meeting, held in December, 1984, Camarena's photograph was passed 
around and conspirators said they were "going to take care of him," the memo 
said. The final meeting was held in early February, 1985, just a few days 
before Camarena was kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
"Corruption amongst Mexican high-ranking government and law enforcement 
officials was pervasive," according to the prosecution's trial brief. "Law 
enforcement officials were on the traffickers' payroll, and facilitated matters 
by providing protection for marijuana and cocaine loads, and escorting 
marijuana shipments being transported and smuggled into the United States." 
</P>
<P>
One defense lawyer said the trial brief "confirms, once again, that the Mexican 
government is on trial."
