  The Colombian Army discovered a warehouse where chemicals 
used to process cocaine were stored and arrested six members of 
the Cali Cartel. The chemicals included 1,553 gallons of 
hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, acetone, thinner, alcohol, and 
formol, and 2.5 tons of magnesium carbonate, activated coal, 
sodium sulfate, and sodium bicarbonate. The Army estimated the 
value of the chemicals to be $1.2 million. (Madrid EFE in

<H5>  Guatemala </H5>
  Official sources have reported that on 16 February the 
Treasury Police destroyed a marijuana plantation in the northern 
El Peten Department valued at $4.805 million. There were no 
arrests, as the owners managed to escape. According to the same 
sources, during 1993 the Treasury Police confiscated several 
shipments of cocaine, marijuana, poppy plants, and opium worth 
$184.2 million. The report added that 7,223,988 marijuana 
plants were destroyed during that same period. (Mexico City
