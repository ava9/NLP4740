  [Excerpts] Yesterday, the Office of the Attorney General of 
the Republic [PGR] dealt the international drug traffic a severe 
blow by seizing 1.5 tons of cocaine, 8.7 tons of packed 
marijuana, 3.5 kg of heroin, and 1.2 kg of opium gum, with a 
combined worth of approximately 5 million new pesos. During the 
operations conducted by Federal Judicial Police [PJF] forces in 
several of the Federation's states, 20 persons presumed guilty 
of crimes against health were arrested. 
  Eight vehicles used to commit these crimes were seized, 
including a speedboat employed to transport drugs. The 
confiscated drugs would have put 100 million doses into 
circulation. [passage omitted] 
  The PGR branch office in Sonora announced that, at the 
highway checkpoint (Precos) set up on the outskirts of the town 
of Hermosillo, Arturo Huerta Castaneda and Leopoldo Guzman 
Ortega were arrested. They were carrying 22 kg and 500 grams of 
cocaine on a Mexican Interstate Line passenger bus. The drugs 
were bound for the border at Tijuana, Baja California. [passage 
omitted] 
  As for marijuana, the largest seizure was made in the Sonora 
municipality of Benjamin Hill, at a highway checkpoint, where 
the PJF located a shipment of 5,595 kg of the grass. It had been 
packed and concealed in freight car 104533, owned by Ferronales, 
which was making the run between Guadalajara and Mexicali, Baja 
California. 
  The PGR's state branch office revealed that, as a result of 
an anonymous phone call reporting the transport of said 
shipment, the cannabis contained in 897 packages was confiscated. 
  Furthermore, federal agents arrested Jose Francisco Arevalo 
Alvarado, who was driving a Federal Public Service Torton truck 
bearing the firm name "Autotransportes Valladolid," with 
domicile in Morelia, Michoacan. The vehicle was stopped when its 
load was noted to be overweight. The driver claimed to be 
carrying earthenware to the town of Reynosa, Tamaulipas. 
However, during the inspection 78 packages of cannabis were 
found, with a gross weight of two tons and 727 grams. [passage
