  [Text] Yesterday, in the town of Tijuana, Baja California, 
Federal Judicial Police [PJF] personnel captured three presumed 
drug dealers with 43 kg and 980 grams of cocaine base in their 
possession. The drugs were worth over 120 million new pesos and 
were to be shipped to the United States. 
  Martin Torres Flores, Fausto Gonzalez Solis, and Jose Luis 
Rivas Rosas were arrested by federal agents on the 
Guadalajara-Tepic highway, eight km from the municipality of 
Magdalena. They were carrying the drugs in compartments 
concealed under the roof of a van with state of California 
plates. 
  According to investigations conducted by the agent of the 
Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, a vehicle with certain 
characteristics was due to travel along that highway carrying 
the alkaloid shipment. 
  Hence, at a checkpoint in the aforementioned locality, the 
PJF agents intercepted these individuals riding in a red Dodge 
Ram van with a detachable roof and license plates 30X100. 
  When the vehicle was searched, the drugs were found, and 
those subjects, together with the cocaine, were taken into 
custody and placed at the disposal of the agent at the Federal 
Public Prosecutor's Office. In their preliminary statements, 
they claimed that the alkaloid had come from Tuxpan, Jalisco, 
and was bound for Tijuana, Baja California, to be smuggled into 
the United States later. 
  It should be noted that, thus far in this administration, a 
total of 225 tons of cocaine has been seized in antidrug 
operations throughout the country. Moreover, 165 Federal 
Judicial Police agents have lost their lives in direct 
confrontations associated with the relentless battle against the 
drug traffic.
