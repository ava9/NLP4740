  [Excerpt] Another sizable drug shipment, this time totaling 
three tons and 876 kg, was confiscated yesterday by federal 
agents assigned to the Office of the Attorney General of the 
Republic [PGR] and detailed to Nuevo Leon State. With other 
seizures made recently, this brings the figure for the week to 
10 tons. The total worth of these drugs is approximately 250 
million new pesos. 
  On this occasion, the Federal Judicial Police agents 
captured 
10 presumed drug dealers who were about to move the drugs to the 
United States. Of the five vehicles seized from them, four were 
escorting a trailer truck carrying the marijuana under a 
shipment of fertilizer. 
  The PGR's branch office in that state reported that, after a 
series of investigations, it was learned that a group of drug 
traffickers intended to make the move in the vicinity of the 
highway leading from Monterrey to Reynosa, Tamaulipas. 
  Arrested on that highway, near the La Tortola ranch, were 
Fernando Ruiz Salgado, Gumaro Garza de la Garza, Juan Ariel 
Lopez Moreno, and Jorge Antonio Gomez Garza. They were riding in 
a Grand Marquis vehicle without license plates, forming the 
surveillance convoy for the large marijuana shipment. 
  Also arrested were Jaime Ortiz Garcia, Edgar Moreno Silva, 
and Maximo Avila Murillo, riding in a Cutlass sedan, and Edmundo 
Canales Rodriguez, all of whom were engaged in surveillance. Two 
Nissan compact cars were seized as well. 
  The last one to be arrested, Jaime Ramirez Gonzalez, was 
driving the red tractor trailer truck with treads. Realizing 
that he had been detected, he attempted to escape with the 
truck; however, after a chase along the highway, he was forced 
to stop. When the vehicle was searched, hundreds of packages 
wrapped in self-stick plastic, with a gross weight of three tons 
and 876 kg, were discovered. 
  The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office indicated that, 
within 
the next few hours, the decision would be made for the remand of 
these individuals to the pertinent district court, based on 
their presumed guilt of committing various crimes against 
health. An investigation is also being made to determine the 
possible participation of Jose Luis Antu Martinez, who attempted 
to obstruct the federal agents' work. [passage omitted]
