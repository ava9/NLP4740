Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, and Vitaliy Trubetskoy] 
  [Text] The head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev, 
believes that the incident involving the cancelled meeting 
between President Boris Yeltsin and the former American 
President, Richard Nixon, as the recent "spy scandal connected 
with the Ames case", "must not be projected on political 
relations." The ex-president's aides are to blame for the 
incident, said Kozyrev in answer to Interfax's question after 
his Thursday's meeting with his Italian counterpart, Julio 
Andreatta. 
  According to Kozyrev, "Nixon's first mistake was to neglect 
to address Russia's Foreign Ministry." "This is the usual 
practice, the more so as we have known each other for a long 
time. We would have oriented the ex-president correctly from 
the very beginning, in regard to meetings with the opposition he 
was seeking, too," Kozyrev said. "We, too, have to deal with 
the opposition every day, and know it well. Had Nixon asked me 
for a friendly advice, as a professional in the area of 
international relations, I would have advised him to confer with 
President Yeltsin first, particularly in view of the fact that 
they have known each other for a long time, and find acceptable 
and tactful ways to meet with the opposition leaders only 
afterwards. There were no obstacles for such meetings." 
  He does not blame the American ex-president for what 
happened, Kozyrev stressed. "We blame his aides, who ought to 
have organized his trip with the help of their good friends in 
Russia, who would have oriented Nixon professionally. Now his 
aides have only themselves to blame," the foreign minister said. 
  According to him, "there is no point in politicizing the 
errors of aides who did not manage to organize everything on a 
proper professional level." "The blunders of Nixon's aides must 
not cast a shadow on Russian-American relations," Kozyrev 
pointed out. 
  With reference to his talks with the head of Italian 
diplomacy, Julio Andreatta, Kozyrev said that they had focused 
on the ways to organize the next G-7 summit with Russia's 
participation. It's common knowledge that currently Italy is 
the G-7's chairman. 
  "We focused our attention on how to move toward turning the 
G-7 into G-8 at least in regard to political issues, where to do 
without Russia is impossible," Kozyrev said. 
  According to him, the two sides also discussed the activity 
of the CSCE, since Andreatta is the chairman of that 
organization. They also considered such topics, as developments 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the situation connected with Russian 
troops withdrawal from the Baltic countries, and the observance 
of Russian-speakers' rights there. 
  Former U.S. President Richard Nixon has no intention of 
curtailing his visit to Russia and will remain in Moscow until 
March 16, officials close to Nixon, who is on a private visit in 
the Russian capital, told Interfax. 
  On Wednesday [9 March] President Yeltsin said neither he nor 
any of the Russian leaders would see Nixon following his 
meetings with opposition leaders -- Communist Party leader 
Gennadiy Zyuganov and former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy. 
  "We will not seek meetings with Russian officials," one of 
Nixon's aides told Interfax. He said Nixon would attend a 
formal reception at the U.S. Embassy late on Thursday and speak 
to embassy officials at 1200 on Friday. He will later meet with 
Russian deputies including Irina Khakamada. 
  Asked if Nixon was planning to meet LDP [Liberal Democratic 
Party] leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, one of his aides said "no 
agreement has been reached, though Zhirinovskiy's 
representatives were in contact with the American side." 
  The aide said that although Nixon arrived in Moscow in a 
private capacity, this did not prevent him from maintaining 
contacts with the U.S. Embassy here. 
  A meeting between a representative of another state and the 
opposition leader in a democratic country "must not be viewed as 
a provocative act," the leader of the Democratic Party faction 
in the State Duma, Nikolay Travkin, told Interfax in comments on 
President Yeltsin's refusal to meet with the former U.S. 
president, Richard Nixon. 
  As Travkin said, the fact that "somebody came and conferred 
with the opposition must not irritate the head of state who 
claims the role of democrat and builder of democracy."
