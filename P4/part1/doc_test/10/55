With a heavily edited version of a key White House tape and museum displays 
that avoid many aspects of the scandal, including the criminal convictions of 
several senior aides, the new Richard M. Nixon library constitutes the former 
President's most recent effort in a 16-year campaign to reshape the public's 
view of Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
Library officials repeatedly had told reporters in recent days and weeks that 
the tapes presented at the museum would be left unedited. Asked Friday about 
that, library director Hugh Hewitt declined to comment. "That's a museum design 
question," he said, adding that the museum design had been supervised by 
Nixon's top aide and spokesman, John Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Watergate display, which Nixon avoided when he gave President Bush and 
former Presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald R. Ford a tour of the museum 
Thursday, opened to the public Friday. It consists of three White House tapes, 
two of which will not be available to visitors until September, and a long wall 
of text and photographs describing the events of the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The one tape available to the public now is the so-called "smoking gun" tape of 
July 23, 1972, in which Nixon approved a plan to have the CIA warn the FBI to 
stop its investigation of Watergate. The library version of the tape presents 
only some portions of the conversation, stitched together with a narration that 
offers innocent explanations for what Nixon is heard saying. The tape concludes 
with Nixon reading a diary entry made two weeks later describing later events. 
</P>
<P>
The text displays concede that "Nixon himself has said he made inexcusable 
misjudgments during Watergate" but accuse many of Nixon's critics -- ranging 
from the late Sen. Sam Ervin (D-N.C.), who chaired the Senate's investigation 
of Watergate, to Archibald Cox, the Harvard law professor who served as special 
prosecutor until Nixon fired him -- of "partisan" bias. 
</P>
<P>
Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward and his former colleague Carl Bernstein 
are singled out for special criticism. One display accuses the two, who won a 
Pulitzer Prize for their reporting on Watergate, of "offering bribes, illegally 
gaining access to telephone numbers and talking to members of the grand jury" 
in their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The display puts that accusation in quotes attributed only to an unnamed 
"scholar." The quotation is from a recent book on Watergate by Stanley I. 
Kutler of the University of Wisconsin. Kutler, in an interview Friday, said 
that in the book he did not make the charge himself, but merely had noted that 
others had said it. Woodward, in an interview Friday, denied ever having 
offered bribes. 
</P>
<P>
As portrayed in thousands of pages of transcripts from court trials and 
congressional hearings, hundreds of hours of taped White House conversations 
and depositions from scores of witnesses, the scandal that became known as 
"Watergate" was, in fact, two overlapping conspiracies. 
</P>
<P>
The first, begun early in the Nixon term, was a plan to use wiretaps, 
burglaries and surveillance by the FBI, the CIA and independent groups 
organized by White House aides to harass, spy on and punish the President's 
enemies. Members of one of those independent groups, known informally as "the 
plumbers," were arrested on June 17, 1972, as they tried to break into the 
offices of Democratic National Chairman Lawrence O'Brien in Washington's 
Watergate office building. 
</P>
<P>
Before the scandal ended, John D. Ehrlichman, Nixon's top domestic policy 
adviser, G. Gordon Liddy, general counsel to Nixon's reelection campaign and 
eight others were found guilty of criminal acts connected to that conspiracy. 
The museum contains no mention of that first conspiracy or the convictions that 
flowed from it. 
</P>
<P>
The second conspiracy, which began almost immediately after the Watergate 
arrests, was designed to cover up the first conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Ehrlichman, H. R. Haldeman, who was Nixon's chief of staff, Atty. Gen. John N. 
Mitchell and eight others were found guilty of criminal acts in connection with 
that conspiracy. Nixon's own participation in the cover-up effort led the 
Watergate grand jury to name him an "unindicted co-conspirator" on Feb. 29, 
1974, and formed the basis for most of the impeachment charges that the House 
Judiciary Committee approved, 27 to 11, on July 27, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
As portrayed by the museum's display, the scandal that drove Nixon from office 
is far different, the way the former President has always seen it: "An epic and 
bloody political battle" in which Democrats sought to reverse the "mandate of 
the 1972 election" by forcing him from office. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the museum first hear of Watergate during a 27-minute film that 
portrays highlights of Nixon's career. The mention is brief. "The President 
knew nothing about it," a narrator says, referring to the Watergate break-in. 
But, the narrator continues, in the months that followed, "some of his aides" 
became involved in a "cover-up." The film then leaves the subject entirely, 
returning only to say, without further explanation, that "threatened with 
impeachment," Nixon resigned. 
</P>
<P>
The Watergate room itself presents a carefully selected set of facts about the 
scandal. Nixon, the opening display says, "did not pay much attention to" the 
break-in when he first heard of it the next day. That display does not mention 
the fact that Nixon and Haldeman met and discussed the break-in for 20 minutes 
two days later. 
</P>
<P>
The tape of that July 20 discussion was mysteriously erased -- the 18 
1/2-minute gap that became one of Watergate's most notorious incidents. 
According to the museum display, which mentions the gap but does not explain 
which conversation it involved, "experts said the gap could easily have been 
caused by a mechanical malfunction, but the President's opponents wasted no 
time in finding sinister and devious motives." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a team of experts appointed by U.S. District Judge John Sirica 
reported on June 4 that the tape had been erased by hand and that 
"malfunctioning of the recorder" was "conclusively eliminated" as a possible 
cause of the erasures.
