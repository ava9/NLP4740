China seems headed for a springtime of sensitive anniversaries and bad 
memories. At the same time, relations between the United States and the Chinese 
regime of Deng Xiaoping head for the deep freeze, as Bush Administration 
officials belatedly realize they must wait for far-reaching changes in China's 
leadership before they can even hope to restore once-close ties. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, President Bush's overtures to the Chinese leadership last year 
-- particularly his decision to dispatch National Security Adviser Brent 
Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger twice on secret 
missions to Beijing -- were a failure. They did not bring about an end to 
Chinese repression. They did not assure safe release for Chinese leading 
dissident, Fang Lizhi, now in refuge at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
And they did not set in motion a process enabling Congress and the American 
public, on one side, or the old guard in China's leadership, on the other, to 
become more accommodating. On the contrary: It can be argued that the secret 
missions served merely to accentuate fundamental disagreements between the two 
governments. In its very eagerness to prevent change, the Bush Administration 
managed to accelerate it. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, Bush was boasting that, in the wake of Scowcroft's December 
meeting with Deng, China had toned down hard-line rhetoric against the United 
States. But in recent weeks China's rhetoric has taken on a hard edge, just as 
it did last fall. Chinese leaders continue to suggest that the United States 
has been plotting to overthrow Chinese communism through a strategy of 
"peaceful evolution." The official Chinese press has heaped abuse on U.S. 
intervention in the world, citing Bush's invasion of Panama as most recent 
example. "What right does a hegemonist that wantonly infringes on other 
countries' rights and bullies the weak by force have in prating about human 
rights?" asked one publication. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a continuation of cultural and educational exchanges, but at 
reduced levels. After months of wrangling, the two countries agreed to continue 
the Fulbright scholars' exchange program next year, but the number of people 
has been cut back by one-third. China has refused to send students abroad for 
some exchange programs, including one run by Johns Hopkins University. The 
United States is considering a possible phase-out of the once-touted program 
run by the State University of New York to teach business management to Chinese 
students in the city of Dalian. The Bush Administration was particularly 
embarrassed when the Chinese imposed new rules making it harder for students to 
study abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Now, seeking to limit the political damage, Administration officials gradually 
modify their public statements on China. Back in January, Bush and Vice 
President Dan Quayle repeatedly assured the nation that the Scowcroft mission 
had brought about important concrete results. But two weeks ago, in an 
interview with NBC's Tom Brokaw, the President admitted that "there hasn't been 
much give" from the Chinese leadership yet, and "I wish there would be more." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate TV interview, Quayle responded to a question about the 
Administration overture to China, "I will not say it's been a failure. It's 
been a disappointment . . . . China refuses to recognize reality, and that's 
freedom and democracy eventually." Those last words were probably more 
irritating and threatening to the Chinese leadership than anything said on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
In private, some of the principal American architects of the once-close U.S. 
ties with China put out the word that the Chinese leadership should not hope 
for further unilateral U.S. concessions. Last month, Chinese Ambassador to the 
United States Zhu Qizhen travelled to the New Jersey home of Richard M. Nixon 
for a small dinner with the former President and some prominent American 
leaders in politics and business. According to one participant, the ambassador 
argued that now was the time for the Bush Administration to take a major new 
step in improving relations; Zhu wanted the United States to open the way for 
more and speedier World Bank loans to China. But former Democratic Party 
Chairman Robert Strauss told the ambassador that Bush had already gone as far 
as he could go without major changes in Beijing; when it comes to China, 
Strauss said, Bush has no political running room left. Nixon said he agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few weeks, the young and disaffected in China will have a number 
of opportunities to demonstrate displeasure. Qing Ming festival occurs in early 
April, the annual Chinese commemoration of the dead -- including the hundreds, 
if not thousands, killed in the vicinity of Tian An Men Square last June. 
Throughout the spring, China will mark the anniversary of key moments in last 
year's tumultuous pro-democracy demonstrations. The leading organization of 
Chinese dissidents in France and the United States, the Federation for 
Democracy in China, has purchased a 1,140-ton ship and outfitted it with a 
radio transmitter, hoping to broadcast to the mainland from international 
waters off the Chinese coastline. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese regime will probably be able to prevent or shut down any new 
trouble in the streets. Yet new, publicized confrontations will deter any 
Chinese efforts to restore ties with the United States and other Western 
nations. The next possible battle in Congress over Administration overtures 
toward Beijing may come later this spring, when China comes up for annual 
renewal of its most-favored nation status, the trade classification assuring 
the lowest possible tariffs on exports to the United States. A change in 
China's trade status would be the most severe economic blow the United States 
could impose, short of something no one wants -- a return to the old days of a 
trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
As it sought to defend and bolster its China policy, the Bush Administration 
has often found itself ensnarled in a series of seeming contradictions. 
Sometimes U.S. officials have insisted that Deng, now 85 and in frail health, 
is in command and still committed to reforming China. On other occasions, they 
have mourned that the Chinese leadership is so beset by divisions that no bold 
action is possible. Sometimes Administration officials have argued that China 
is as strategically important to the United States as it ever was. On other 
occasions, they acknowledge that, given the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe 
and the Soviet Union, China's strategic significance has changed. 
</P>
<P>
Coming up with a new foreign-policy rationale for the old, close ties with 
China -- a relationship forged in the Nixon era and based on shared opposition 
to the Soviet Union -- is not easy. Recently, on Capitol Hill, Eagleburger 
maintained that China is important to the United States because of the 
proliferation of missiles, nuclear weapons and chemical weapons around the 
world. That strange argument suggested that the more missiles and weapons China 
sells, the more important to the United States it will become. Meanwhile, Nixon 
himself has been pressing the argument that the United States needs China's 
help to prevent Japan from becoming a political and military superpower. Such 
talk does nothing to help U.S. ties with Japan, currently America's closest 
ally in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Bush and the Chinese were essentially trying to see whether they 
could could repair relationships after Tian An Men. Now, it seems less 
possible. In the United States, public attitudes toward China have changed. 
Within the Chinese leadership, opinions about the United States seem to have 
changed. Both countries find it difficult to return to business as usual in a 
changing world.
