diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has no information as to 
the whereabouts and plans of ex-President Richard Nixon who came 
to the Russian capital for a visit. 
  As a high-ranking American diplomat told INTERFAX, the 
embassy does not monitor private visits. The ex-president came 
to Russia in a purely personal capacity. He has no contacts 
with the embassy; he has not informed it of his movements or 
further plans, the diplomat said. 
  As INTERFAX learned from the travel agency Connect servicing 
Nixon's visit, the ex-president will stay in Moscow till about 
March 16th. 
  According to a member of the agency directly concerned with 
the high-ranking guest, his arrival in Moscow is in no way 
connected with Big Politics or business. Richard Nixon simply 
likes to visit Russia, meet with Russian people and to see the 
changes in the country. His present trip to Moscow is neither 
the first nor the last, he said. 
  The North-American Department of Russia's Foreign Ministry 
told INTERFAX that the ministry has nothing to do with Nixon's 
visit to Moscow. 
  "The Russian Foreign Ministry would have monitored the 
ex-president's visit, had the American embassy been in charge of 
it" a high-ranking Russian diplomat told INTERFAX's 
correspondent. 
  According to him, the visit is of "a purely scientific 
nature". "Nixon's ties with the Carnegie Foundation and with the 
Fund for Democracy are well known. Evidently the former 
American president is on a visit in Moscow in connection with 
these organizations," he said. 
  Another Russian diplomat interviewed by Interfax's 
correspondent has a different point of view. "As a retired 
politician Nixon may allow himself what officials from the 
Clinton Administration cannot afford. He has already conferred 
with the Communist leader, Gennadiy Zyuganov, and with the 
former Vice-President, Aleksandr Rutskoy. Nixon makes no secret 
of his intention to meet with the Liberal Democratic Party 
leader, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. All this reflects a striving to 
"sound out the situation," if not "build bridges," and to 
clarify what the Russian opposition is like, and whether it is 
capable of coming to power eventually," he said.
