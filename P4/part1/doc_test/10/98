<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Nixon said he expects historians to judge him more by 
Watergate than by his diplomatic overtures to China. 
</P>
<P>
"Historians are more likely to lead with 'He resigned the office,' " Nixon said 
in an interview in the latest issue of Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"The jury has already come in, and there's nothing that's going to change it. 
There's no appeal. Historians will judge it harshly." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon discussed the Watergate break-in in his new book "In the Arena," 
excerpted in the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The former President said that he made the "inexcusable error" of asking the 
CIA to block an FBI investigation of the Watergate break-in, but that the CIA 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon said a decision by then-CIA Director Richard Helms and his deputy, Vernon 
Walters, to ignore the request discredits Watergate's "most serious myth -- the 
one that ultimately forced me to resign:" that the CIA, in fact, obstructed the 
FBI investigation on his orders.
