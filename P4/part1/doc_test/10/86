Former President Richard Nixon said today that the fact that he resigned will 
always be a part of his presidency but that down the road the people, rather 
than the historians, will remember that he made a difference in the quest for 
world peace. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with host Bryant Gumbel on NBC's "Today," Nixon, who resigned 
in 1974 rather than face impeachment on charges related to the Watergate 
scandal, was asked what historians will write about his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, what historians will write and what history in the broader sense may 
conclude could be very different," Nixon responded. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon said he will be remembered for making a difference "as far as our 
relations with China are concerned and in initiating a new relationship with 
the Soviet Union, in saving Israel with an airlift in 1973, in ending the 
Vietnam War, ending the draft. I think those events will be remembered. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "Of course, I'm doing a little wishful thinking here, I know, 
and I would not suggest that historians, the current crop, would ever reach 
that conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
As for his own resurgence in the public light, Nixon was asked to reflect on 
his own words when he said public sympathy comes to even the most controversial 
with the onset of old age. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it depends on what the public is," said the 77-year-old Nixon. "Some of 
the public say, 'My God, is the man ever going to die?' And all they're 
interested in is reading my obituary. And then there are others who are amazed 
I'm still alive. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, what I hope is that my life, in addition to being 
examples that you can make a difference if you set your mind to it in public 
leadership, what I hope is that people will remember that I lived by the rule: 
Never give up. Never look back. Always look forward. And if that is the lesson 
that young people can get from my life, it will have all been worthwhile. Never 
give up."
