<F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev report: "Washington's White House Knew </F>
About Nixon's Meetings. The Kremlin Also Knew of Them in 
Advance"] 
  [Text] The Washington White House and President William 
Clinton personally knew that ex-President Richard Nixon, on 
setting out to visit Moscow, intended to meet with leaders of 
the Russian political opposition, including Zyuganov, Rutskoy, 
and Zhirinovskiy. No objections were made to Nixon on this 
score, nor was approval given, since these meetings were planned 
within the framework of the unofficial part of the trip by the 
ex-president, who had invitations both from the Russian Security 
Council and from the Foreign Policy Association. 
  The fact that this is so was confirmed by Clinton himself, 
who offered explanations to this effect on U.S. television 
Wednesday. According to our data, Thomas Pickering, the U.S. 
ambassador to Moscow, was given instructions, also Wednesday, to 
investigate the reasons for the diplomatic mini-scandal which 
marked the trip by Nixon, who was refused his preplanned 
meetings with Boris Yeltsin, Viktor Chernomyrdin, and other 
high-ranking staffers of the government and the presidential 
entourage. Pickering has already had contacts with the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in this connection, in particular 
with Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov. 
  According to members of Nixon's delegation, the Russian 
president's statement that William Clinton had "distanced 
himself from the trip" was groundless. 
  Official Moscow was informed on the day the ex-president 
arrived in Russia, i.e. last Sunday [6 March], that Nixon would 
meet with opposition leaders: Foreign Ministry staffers and 
representatives of the Protocol Department of the Russian 
president's apparatus were issued with the program of the visit, 
listing the meetings. There was more than enough time to voice 
their objections and to demand that meetings be refused. But at 
that stage, so I was told by Nixon's delegation, no objections 
were forthcoming. 
  According to data from the Nixon delegation, the 
ex-president 
is gradually filling the gaps resulting from the refusals to 
meet with him. In particular, talks with Russian 
parliamentarians are scheduled for Thursday. 
  Attempts to obtain official comments from Russian sources -- 
from the Foreign Ministry, above all -- had not met with success 
by the time this issue was signed to press. On a strictly 
unofficial basis some diplomats regarded the report that 
Pickering had contacted Mamedov as "disinformation." It was 
also pointed out that the Russian Foreign Ministry has nothing 
to do with Nixon's visit. It must follow from this that the 
Foreign Ministry also was not familiar with the program of 
meetings in advance.
