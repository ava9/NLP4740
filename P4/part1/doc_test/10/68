  [Text] Moscow March 9 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and presidential chief of staff Sergey Filatov have 
called off their scheduled meetings with visiting ex-President 
of the United States Richard Nixon. 
  Kremlin sources, who said earlier that President Boris 
Yeltsin's meeting with Nixon was now "problematic", have just 
told ITAR-TASS that the Russian president has refused to meet 
the American visitor. 
  Competent sources told ITAR-TASS that the cancellation of 
these meetings was decided after the former American president 
met former Russian Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy, amnestied 
recently. 
  Nixon's initiative must have been seen as a sign of 
disrespect for the political will of the Russian leadership. 
  On Tuesday, Richard Nixon told journalists that Russian 
authorities had not hampered his contacts with the leaders of 
the oppositional forces. 
  But to all appearances, after demonstrating their democratic 
thinking, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Sergey Filatov reserved the 
right to view Nixon's contacts with opposition leaders, 
including one of the organisers of the armed resistance to 
President Yeltsin last autumn, as they saw fit.
