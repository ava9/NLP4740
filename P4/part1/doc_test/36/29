"The Measure of a Man," the Feb. 19 episode of "Star Trek: The Next 
Generation," was wonderful. Fascinating . . . intriguing . . . superb . . . 
beautiful -- it was all these and much, much more. Not since "City on the Edge 
of Forever" has "Star Trek" produced such a heart-rending and heartwarming 
show.
