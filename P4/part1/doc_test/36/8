If you want to find your Christmas-week movies at the video store rather than 
contend with the crowds at the theaters, it'll help if you're a fan of Jerry 
Lee Lewis, Freddy Krueger, the "Star Trek" crew or Almodovar. 
</P>
<P>
Almodovar is how Spanish director Pedro Almodovar's name is often shortened in 
the credits for his offbeat films, and the most popular of his outrageous, 
Bunuel-on-speed comedies, "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" is new to 
videocassette this week (Orion, $79.98, R). The surreal farce about a woman who 
entertains several odd visitors after losing her lover stars Carmen Maura and 
Fernando Guillen. 
</P>
<P>
Also just out is a horror film that might have been subtitled "Teen-Agers on 
the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" (but wasn't) -- "Nightmare on Elm Street 5: 
The Dream Child" (Media, $89.95, R). Robert Englund once again does his thing 
as dream-haunting slasher Freddy Krueger. The tape includes a rap video by the 
group Whodini, if that's a big selling point to you. 
</P>
<P>
"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier" (Paramount, no list price, PG) shows the 
sci-fi series well past the verge of overextending its welcome, especially with 
William Shatner directing (flaccidly) instead of Leonard Nimoy. But if you're a 
Trekkie set on collecting all of the films, at least wait a few months until 
Paramount reduces this one to the $15-$30 range. That "no list price" means 
that you'd have to pay almost $100 for it now. 
</P>
<P>
"Great Balls of Fire!" (Orion, $89.98, PG-13) seemed to evoke the same 
descriptive word from every critic who reviewed it earlier this year: cartoon. 
They didn't mean that this film about singer-pianist-wild man Jerry Lee Lewis' 
rise and fall was animated by the folks who did "Roger Rabbit"; they meant that 
it treated Lewis' fascinating story (focusing on his marriage to his 
13-year-old second cousin) colorfully but superficially. Dennis Quaid stars. 
</P>
<P>
Other new-to-video movies: "La Lectrice" (Orion, $79.98, R) is a clever, 
whimsical comedy starring Miou-Miou. It's all about, believe it or not, 
reading. Michel Deville directed. 
</P>
<P>
"Lock Up" (IVE, $89.95, R) is a prison drama for die-hard Sylvester Stallone 
fans only. 
</P>
<P>
"How I Got into College" (CBS/Fox, $89.98, PG-13) satirizes college recruitment 
and stars Corey Parker, Christopher Rydell and Anthony Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
"Renegades" (MCA, $89.95, R) boasts a heavyweight bunch of brat-packers (Kiefer 
Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Jami Gertz) in a weakly scripted cop/buddy 
film. TERRY ATKINSON
