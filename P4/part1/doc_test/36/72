One film with a special set of characteristics is an accident. Two with the
same set is a coincidence. Three is a starting gun to the world's
trend-spotting film critics.
Pausing only to grasp their essay pens, they hurtle into action, hypotheses
flailing. Maverick, The Beverly Hillbillies and The Flintstones - three
movies based on old American TV series, opening this week and next in
Britain] This must mean that western popular culture is undergoing an
important new spasm.
If only. But if the large screen is raiding the small, it is no more than a
twitch on a now well-established graph line. Where were these 'Eureka]'
critics while the skies were raining Batmans, Star Treks and Addams
Families? In Hollywood, as we in the 1990s surely know, the sons and
daughters of yesterday's couch potatoes are today's popcorn fodder.
The new TV adaptations, like the earlier ones, each take a once popular
series that rejoiced in skimpy production values and give them the
big-dollar treatment. And each trusts that a freshly campy approach to
material that was already tongue-in-cheek will be hailed as the New
Sophistication.
What we have in Maverick is two hours of the new smugness. The 1960s
tele-series, starring James Garner as the poker-playing dandy with the wry,
rictus grin and the six-gun concealed in his corset, was a noted insomnia
cure in its own right: although today's critics are already canonising its
halcyon charm. Maverick the movie kicks Mr Garner upstairs - into the role
of senior gunfighter - while passing Mel Gibson the smirk, the suit and the
stack of cards.
Can our hero win the ultimate poker tournament to be held aboard the
ultimate Mississippi steamboat? Can he get to the steamboat, past a
narrative obstacle course containing Red Indians, enemy gamblers, sudden
guest stars (James Coburn) and thieving saloon beauties (Jodie Foster)? Not
to mention all those slapstick fight scenes, in which every bullet or blow
of fist solicits an audience chortle.
'It's not unlike the Lethal Weapon movies,' Gibson has said in interviews:
in case we thought that the film was based on exhaustive historical
research. This Bret Maverick quips, smirks and double-takes; he turns on and
off the sudden violence; and he is directed by Lethal's very own Richard
Donner with Lethal buddy Danny Glover popping up in a two-second bandit
cameo.
Elsewhere we have a funny bit about politically correct Indians; a funny bit
about a runaway stagecoach; and another funny bit about a sackful of
rattlesnakes at a lynching. The problem with these funny bits is that for
the most part, as directed by Donner and scripted by William (Butch Cassidy
And The Sundance Kid) Goldman, they are not funny. The only thing that held
my attention throughout was Miss Foster. Can Our Lady of the Silent Lambs, I
wondered, stretch her range do a knockabout comical role? Not quite. But
unlike the rest of the rheumatic reflex artists around her, she does try.
The press show of The Beverly Hillbillies saw at least one early walk-out
from a critic. But who am I to wag a finger? I kept falling asleep. I
dreamed that a jalopyful of peasants with twanging accents journeyed to
Beverly Hills, after striking oil in the Arkanas backwoods, and became
enmeshed in a chaotic plot about evil businessmen (Dabney Coleman),
shape-changing secretaries (Lily Tomlin) and sudden guest stars (Buddy
Ebsen).
Ah - that was the film? And there was I thinking I was still in Maverick; or
that my dreams urgently needed a new scriptwriter. This film employed no
less than four, none of whom seems to have been able to come up with an
original comic moment. Jim Varney, Cloris Leachman and Diedrich Bader are
among the Ozark-accented muggers. And the director is the once-promising
Penelope (Suburbia, Dudes) Spheeris.
Elsewhere in this non-improving week, you have a choice of female monuments.
After watching Ma Saison Preferee and Gypsy on the same day - let us call it
Black Monday - a terrible urge came upon me to swap the female leads.
The French film's glacial, torpid study of a brother-sister relationship
riven by love-hate - he (Daniel Auteuil) is a tormented, philandering brain
surgeon, she (Catherine Deneuve) is a repressed public notary - would surely
be livened up if we replaced Deneuve with Bette Midler? And Gypsy, a loud,
stagy rehash of the Styne-Sondheim musical, might have a surreal charm if
Hurricane Bette as Gypsy Rose Lee's all-singing, all-screaming stage momma
were replaced by ice-cool Catherine.
She would delicately urge her daughter to enter the lower depths of show
business, invoking the cultural precedent of Toulouse-Lautrec or the
fruitful existential anguish of Juliette Greco. Meanwhile Midler would be
found somewhere in France, raising vocal hell: a banshee let loose in the
banlieu.
Instead the two stars stand around firming up the cliches of their
respective vehicles. Andre Techine's listless chamber drama embodies
everything bad about modern French cinema. Its tasteful lesson in family
tension, full of pinched-nerve emotions and pseudo-profundities, resembles a
TV daytime soap rewritten by Andre Malraux. And Deneuve is as elegantly dull
as only she today can be. A once expressive actress - remember Polanski's
Repulsion? - is now cast forever as the First Lady of French cinema.
If Hollywood had a star as inanimate as this, they would consign her to
stand-in work for the Columbia torch lady. What France, in turn, would do
with La Midler we can only guess. Position her, perhaps, at the entrance to
the Channel Tunnel as a warning to all French people going west: 'Apres ca,
le deluge.' In Gypsy Midler bawls, screams, wheedles, cries, laughs and
occasionally sings. The rest of the cast, including Cynthia Gibb's pretty
Louise and Peter Riegert's perky Herbie, are wiped out. For Midler in this
form is not so much an actress: more an exploding barrage balloon with
teeth.
By default the week's best film is Renaissance Man, which in a good week
might be the worst. Danny DeVito, failed advertising man turned supply
teacher, instructs six backward army cadets in the delights of Hamlet. They
rebel; they hellraise; then finally - what else - they knuckle down and come
to love the Bard. By final curtain they have all turned into G. Wilson
Knights and are changing the face of Shakespeare interpretation.
You have to love a film like this. It is foolish, sentimental, and as
directed by Penny Marshall (Awakenings) earnestly inspirational. But at
least it is not based on a TV series, does not star Mel Gibson and does not
lean for support on a once-great diva past her prime.
