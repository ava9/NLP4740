MARYLOUISE OATES: SALUTE TO WISE DRAWS STAR SHOWER 
</P>

You just don't see a whole lot of invitations like this -- even in a town 
where, in the ever-escalating battle for benefit bucks, committee lists begin 
to look like a litany of the rich 'n' famous. 
</P>
<P>
When director Robert Wise is honored by the American Friends of Tel Aviv 
University on Jan. 21, "special guests" will include Julie Andrews, Walter 
Matthau, Paul Newman, Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston and Larry Hagman. 
</P>
<P>
Director Taylor Hackford will preside, and Burt Lancaster will do the 
toastmaster honors, while the honorary dinner chairs are Leonard Bernstein, 
Samuel Goldwyn Jr. and Dr. Armand Hammer. Paramount's Howard W. Koch is the 
dinner chair -- and, if only 10% of the lengthy list of 52 associate chairmen, 
57 associate dinner chairmen and 76 host committee members show up for the 
Beverly Hilton black-tie event, it will be quite a brand-name jam. 
</P>
<P>
And quite a lucrative one, too, since the ticket price is $1,000 a couple. 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder Wise has such Hollywood connections. One of America's premier 
directors, he has on his resume "The Day the Earth Stood Still," "I Want to 
Live," "West Side Story," "The Sound of Music," "Audrey Rose" and "Star Trek." 
He has served as president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 
and as president of the Directors Guild of America. 
</P>
<P>
BEST L.A. STORY OF THE YEAR -- Just a few days into January and here it is -- 
short and sweet. 
</P>
<P>
As screenwriter Gloria Goldsmith tells it, she took her leased Nissan to the 
leasing company to be serviced. She was called early last week and, when she 
showed up the day after the call to pick up the car, it couldn't be found. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder -- it had been sold. 
</P>
<P>
To a dealer. And when the leasing company tried to buy it back, the dealer had 
already sold it. 
</P>
<P>
But everything turned out OK. The dealer bought it back from the buyer, the 
leasing company bought it back from the dealer, and Goldsmith is driving it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
AT IT AGAIN -- From the folks who brought us last fall's newspaper parody "The 
Washington Possible" now comes the L.A. Inaugural Ball -- "The Political Party 
for the Rest of Us." The invitation for the Jan. 20 bash is a smaller version 
of the newspaper, but this one carries the headline "Bush's Inaugural Message: 
'Don't Worry; Be Happy . . . New President Urges Upbeat Mood During Coming 
Depression." Oh, yes, "present your ACLU card for a 10% discount." The credit 
for the party goes to publicist Josh Baran and Rob Vinson, of the 2nd Coming, 
the new dance club on South Bonnie Brae, two blocks east of Alvarado at 9th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
MARK THE FEBRUARY CALENDARS -- Oakwood School salutes 10 years of service by 
its headmaster, Jim Astman, with a more-than-all-star benefit show at the 
Wiltern Theatre on Feb. 5. Among those performing are Rhea Perlman, Mort Sahl, 
Henry Winkler and David Steinberg in a tribute being written variety-show style 
by Iris Dart and Ann Beckett. . . . 
</P>
<P>
That same Sunday night, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera will be honored by the 
Beverly Hills Charitable Foundation and the Beverly Hills B'nai B'rith Lodge as 
men of the year. Tickets for the black-tie event are $350 and $500 a couple -- 
although the invite does point out that for children, black tie is only 
optional and the tickets are $75. 
</P>
<P>
There's a reason for that striking exception, since the evening begins early 
with Hanna-Barbera costumed characters posing for pictures with young (and 
perhaps not-so-young guests). The party is at the Beverly Hills Hotel, and MCA 
President Sidney Sheinberg is honorary chair, while Great American 
Broadcasting's chairman Charles S. Mechem Jr. is the honorary co-chair. . . .

The Los Angeles County Museum of Art unveils "Hispanic Art in the United States 
-- 30 Contemporary Painters &amp; Sculptors" at a black-tie reception Feb. 1. 
The exhibit has been organized by the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and was 
made possible by grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Atlantic 
Richfield Foundation, while the national tour was sponsored by the At&amp;T 
Foundation. The Los Angeles presentation was made possible by the W. Alton 
Jones Foundation.
