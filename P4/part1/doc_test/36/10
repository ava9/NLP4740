I have been reading one of those gloomy essays on the corrosive effects of
television. In the winter issue* of the journal Daedalus, Professor John
Condry of Cornell University argues that dross on the box is stunting the
development of American children. Television, he claims, is contributing to
increased youth violence (including rising rates of suicide), to physical
and mental disorders, and to a secular decline in educational performance.
Children once learned about society, and their place in it, from school and
by directly observing adults in their local communities. Today, says Mr
Condry, television is swamping these influences. On average American
children spend an incredible 40 hours a week watching the box or playing
video games - more than a third of their total waking hours. School,
including time spent travelling and doing homework, absorbs another 40
hours. All other interactions with family and peers - which are potentially
far more productive than TV - have to be crammed into just 32 waking hours,
a fraction of the time enjoyed by past generations.
As well as robbing children of precious time, TV distorts their sense of
reality. Because it is designed primarily to sell things, it has to put a
premium on gaining and keeping people's attention. The easiest way to do
this is by projecting violence. According to Mr Condry the average hour of
children's programming contains 25 acts of violence - far more than adult
TV.
Television distorts in other, more insidious ways. It depicts wealth as the
key to happiness but rarely shows people working hard, because this would be
dull viewing. TV thus leads children to seek 'quick fixes', to want things
but not to see they must work for them. It also presents a dangerously
simplistic moral code, typically dividing the world into heroes, who can do
no wrong, and villains, who can do no right.
Mr Condry's indictment has to be taken seriously. If children spend more
than a third of their waking hours watching TV, their characters must be
moulded by it. Yet his criticisms do not apply to all commercially
successful programming. The producers of the popular series Star Trek, to
take one example, appear quite responsible.
Back in the late 1960s, the starship Enterprise was run almost exclusively
by white males (there was a token black female communications officer and an
Asian helmsman) and toured the universe seemingly looking for trouble. In
nearly every episode, Captain James Kirk proved his manhood by fighting with
some unpleasant alien species (surrogates for the evil Soviet empire) and
falling in love with a beautiful blonde guest star.
Star Trek: the Next Generation (the 1980s' relaunch of the series) shows
distinct signs of progress. The cerebral Captain Jean-Luc Picard has
superseded tough-guy Kirk. A blind black has a responsible post on the
bridge. Women play a more active role and are no longer treated as mere sex
objects; the ship's doctor and security officer, for example, are both
female. As in the first series, the Enterprise is subject to the 'prime
directive' - essentially a code of non-interference.
This year a third series - Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - has hit the nation's
screens. Perhaps reflecting the more reactive stance of US foreign policy in
the 1990s, it is set on a stationary space station rather than a roving
starship. Waiting, rather than looking, for trouble is the station
commander, Ben Sisko (impressively played by Mr Avery Brooks), a black
single parent. His deputy is a feisty female. The station is packed with
aliens of all shapes and sizes, many of whom dislike and misunderstand each
other - a metaphor for the friction endemic to America's multi-racial
society.
Pushing back social frontiers, one leading character, the demure Lieutenant
Jadzia Dax, is a fusion of two lifeforms. She has the body of a 28-year-old
woman but the memories and (partly) mind of a combative old man and former
mentor to Commander Sisko. This could provide scope for a sensitive
exploration of gender and sexual identity.
Deep Space Nine is not exactly great art. As in previous incarnations of
Star Trek, each episode includes plenty of sanitised violence. But by
reserving the best roles for minorities and women, and by spending as much
time on social problems as on warfare, it at least sends some useful signals
to children. Commander Sisko could become quite an important role model for
young black boys.
But even though some commercial TV may do more good than harm, Mr Condry is
right to argue that the US has paid far too little attention to the social
impact of this 'greedy institution'. It seems pointless endlessly to debate
ways of improving school education when so few restraints are placed on
children's TV curriculum.
Ways could surely be found to reduce the number of childhood hours lost to
the box, to increase the proportion of educational programmes, and to limit
the portrayal of violence. (One act of violence every two minutes seems
excessive even for the US.) After all, few parents would thinkingly consign
their offspring, for 40 hours a week, to an institution as empty-headed and
violent as commercial television.
