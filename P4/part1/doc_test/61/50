There is a list, although I've never actually seen it, that is circulated 
throughout the Western Hemisphere and updated periodically. It is a list of 
"Reasons to Hate the Lakers." 
</P>
<P>
It includes such items as: 
</P>
<P>
No. 7,483. Turbowash. 
</P>
<P>
According to a regular Forum PA announcement, Turbowash is "the official 
washing tool of the Los Angeles Lakers." You think that doesn't create waves of 
jealousy around the National Basketball Assn.? I hear the Pistons don't have 
even have an official washing tool, that after games they have to take regular 
showers. 
</P>
<P>
No. 279. Bank sponsorship of the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Most other NBA teams play in dismal buildings. Boston Garden, you wouldn't send 
your cockroaches there for summer camp. The Lakers already have a very nice 
building, and now a bank comes along and gives Jerry Buss lots more money to 
make it even nicer. In exchange, the bank is entitled to stencil its logo on 
everything at the Forum that doesn't move, including the people in line at the 
pizza counter. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1,066. Jack. 
</P>
<P>
Sure we in Los Angeles love the big leering lug, but in rival NBA cities, fans 
are sick of Nicholson's sinister courtside visage, and are praying that the 
rumors are true and that he really is the new Clipper coach. 
</P>
<P>
Today there is a new entry, coming onto the list at No. 1 with a bullet: 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson, MVP. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, there actually are people who don't think Magic Johnson is 
deserving of the MVP trophy, that it should have gone to Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
The people who hold this belief are mostly Easterners, transplanted Easterners 
or other kinds of religious fanatics. 
</P>
<P>
This pettiness-born-of-envy-and-ignorance puts me in the awkward position today 
of having to take sides against the very player after whom I pattern my own 
game. On the playgrounds, I actually am referred to as Air Ostler, although not 
so much for soaring through it as gasping for it. 
</P>
<P>
No, there will be no cheap shots taken at the Sultan of CO2 today, not in this 
column. You probe for weaknesses in Michael Jordan's game and his character and 
the best you can come up with is that his shoes are overpriced and not 
Turbowash-proof. 
</P>
<P>
Let's forget about Jordan for a moment and concentrate on the MVP himself. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibit A: Last Saturday the Lakers opened the Western Conference finals 
against the Phoenix Suns. With 2:22 remaining in the game and the Lakers 
leading by seven points, Magic fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers held on and won the game by eight points. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, you would have thought the Lakers had saved the Alamo by fighting 
off the forces of General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna while armed only with 
Turbowash tools. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley praised his players, and the players praised themselves, 
for being able to protect a seven-point lead, against a much less experienced 
opponent, on the home boards of the All's Quiet on the Western Forum, or 
whatever it's called. I bring this up only because it illustrates how much 
Johnson means to the Lakers, how much his teammates rely on him. 
</P>
<P>
To say that the Bulls need Jordan more than the Lakers need Magic is simply 
erroneous. 
</P>
<P>
When Magic came to Los Angeles 11 years ago the Lakers were a struggling team, 
their great center on the verge of retirement. When Magic leaves the Lakers in 
a few years they will again be a struggling team, their same great center on 
the verge of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
This particular season was marked by experts as the beginning of the inevitable 
Laker fade-out. The main reason that fade-out has yet to begin is that Magic 
lost about 10 pounds of ugly fat, swore off nachos, shaved off his goatee and 
rededicated himself to the game. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to discount the efforts of James Worthy and A. C. Green and other 
equally fiery-eyed Lakers. But we're talking about the most influential guard 
of all time here. 
</P>
<P>
Look at it this way: Air is impossible to guard. Magic is impossible to beat. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Michael Jordan would have a better chance of reaching the NBA finals if he 
had James Worthy up front instead of Horace Grant, and Magic's act would be 
less spectacular if he couldn't kick the ball out to Byron Scott. But you're 
rated on how you work with the materials you're given. Da Vinci didn't get 
graded down as an artist because Mona Lisa had a nice smile. 
</P>
<P>
But why am I bothering to argue with the Jordan-is-MVP faction, which includes 
my esteemed colleague, Hot Air Downey? 
</P>
<P>
Voting for a basketball MVP is an affair of the heart. Debating the issue is 
like arguing over sunsets. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone loves Air Jordan, as is only right, but anyone who can't see that 
Magic is the MVP should have his or her contact lenses Turbowashed.
