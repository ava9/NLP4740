Play ball! No, it's not the beginning of the baseball season yet, but it is the 
start of the big-release video season, and leading off this week's lineup is 
one of the best baseball movies ever made, "Bull Durham" (Orion, $89.98, R). 
</P>
<P>
Starring Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, "Bull Durham" isn't 
just a baseball movie; it's sort of a romantic-metaphysical-sports comedy. And 
it's great fun. Sarandon is passionate both about the sport and its players -- 
notably the two minor-league players played by Costner and Robbins.

Otherwise, it's mainly tough-guy week at the video store: "Die Hard" (CBS/Fox, 
$89.98, R) even outscored "Bull Durham" at the box office last year ($78 
million to $50 million) with its tense story of a cop (Bruce Willis) vs. 
terrorists in a Los Angeles skyscraper. In "The Dead Pool" (Warner, $89.95, R), 
it's Dirty Harry (Clint Eastwood) vs. a serial killer. And "The Presidio" 
(Paramount, $89.95, R) stars Sean Connery and Mark Harmon in a suspense 
thriller (with relationship subplots) about a murder investigation on a 
military base.

Anything for more sensitive viewers? Sure. With its exotic setting (India), 
quirky characters and lush color, "The River" (Connoisseur, $79.95, 1951) looks 
like one of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's films. However, this 
curious, English-language, slightly flawed, often moving picture about a girl's 
crush on a crippled American soldier was the work of the great French director 
Jean Renoir. Connoisseur is also re-releasing three foreign-language films 
previously on other video labels -- Renoir's 1937 anti-war classic "The Grand 
Illusion" ($59.95), Michelangelo Antonioni's ground-breaking, austere 1960 
drama "L'Avventura" ($79.95), and the very slow but haunting 1956 story of a 
Japanese soldier's spiritual conversion, "The Burmese Harp" ($79.95), directed 
by Kon Ichikawa.

It's a bird, it's a plane, it's . . . no, it's a basketball player in "Michael 
Jordan: Come Fly With Me" (CBS/Fox, $19.98). Arguably the sport's best current 
pro (and Magic Johnson fans will argue), the slam-jammin' Jordan's career is 
documented in this 45-minute tribute. TERRY ATKINSON
