Basketball player Joey Wright of the University of Texas didn't know what hit 
him in the opening moments of a 103-84 loss to Oklahoma in Norman, Okla., last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Wright says he took a blow to the mouth, but thought it was merely the result 
of an inadvertent elbow. But a tape of the game shows Oklahoma's Terry Evans 
punching Wright. Officials didn't see the punch, either. 
</P>
<P>
"If I knew what happened, we would have cleared the benches," Wright said. "I 
never saw the punch until I looked at the tape. But I felt it. I thought he 
slipped in an elbow, but it was an outright punch in the mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if there is any action that could be taken, Jamie Ciampaglio, a Texas 
assistant coach, said, "Not until next year." 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners the Longhorns will play in Austin, Tex., next season. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was the NBA, the tape would be reviewed and the player would be fined 
and suspended," Texas Coach Tom Penders said. "Here, there is no one to send it 
to." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Whose interception on the last play of the game Jan. 18, 1976, 
ensured the Pittsburgh Steelers' 21-17 Super Bowl victory over the Dallas 
Cowboys? 
</P>
<P>
Nothing to prove: The Chicago Bulls' Michael Jordan, on plans for a 
pay-per-view one-on-one game against the Lakers' Magic Johnson, an idea the NBA 
has vetoed: "Who cares who can beat another player one on one? Magic's been 
known as an all-around player his whole career. I've been labeled a little bit 
as a one-on-one player and I'm trying to shed that label as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of fans would love to see it mainly because of the status we 
carry in the NBA. But I don't know if that's a fair match. Me against Dominique 
(Wilkins) would probably be more fair. But I'm not trying to start anything 
else, now." 
</P>
<P>
Add NBA: The Celtics' Kevin McHale, denying that he is the source of 
unattributed criticism of teammate Larry Bird, told the Boston Herald: 
"Harmony, scharmony. I'm not a symphony director. Life is too short to say 
anything negative about anyone. I've never been a person to say anything 
negative about a teammate or anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Lethal weapon: Dale Brown, basketball coach at Louisiana State, and Kentucky 
counterpart Rick Pitino nearly came to blows during Saturday night's game at 
Baton Rouge, La. Pitino said a couple of days later that he was not concerned 
about squaring off with Brown -- "unless he wanted to fight me with his mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Add LSU: Vanderbilt's first-year coach, Eddie Fogler, on the LSU lineup that 
includes 7-footers Shaquille O'Neal and Stanley Roberts and high-scoring point 
guard Chris Jackson: "They have three (NBA draft) lottery picks. Do you know 
any other team in the country that has three lottery picks? I don't know if 
there's another team in America that has two." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Glen Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: John McEnroe on why many other tennis stars are skipping the 
once-prestigious Australian Open: "It's silly. You're playing in, like, your 
first tournament of the year, and already it's a Grand Slam." GARR KLUENDER
