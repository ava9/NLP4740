Bill Laimbeer looked at his interrogator with the condescending expression he 
usually sports during interviews. The question: Was he worried. 
</P>
<P>
"About what?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
About whether his Detroit Pistons might tail off at some point. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a stupid question." 
</P>
<P>
Well, isn't it possible that Detroit, which has gone 25-2 since Jan. 23, which 
already has a playoff spot clinched, which has the best record in the league at 
51-16, might at some point go flat? Might lose again? 
</P>
<P>
"Next question," Laimbeer said. "We've got enough guys on our team that we 
don't have flat games." 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, the Pistons really don't seem to have flat games. And what's 
strange about it is no one in the league acts surprised anymore. Detroit 
routinely gave a good Chicago Bulls team a 25-point shellacking at home. Well, 
what can you do? They're the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
"Detroit plays with a lot of confidence against us," Michael Jordan said the 
other day. "Because they know that they may have certain stronger points than 
we have, and they know they can go to them at any time and win the game." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons have guards Joe Dumars and Isiah Thomas, forward James Edwards and 
Laimbeer, not to mention a strong corps of reserves. All signs strongly point 
to the Pistons returning to the NBA finals in June. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit's recent run has been remarkable, an eight-week stretch in which 
they've stormed to the league's best record. Before Thursday night's 115-110 
loss in Houston, they'd won 12 straight, one short of the string they ripped 
off before losing in Atlanta Feb. 23. During the second run the Pistons beat 
Chicago (twice), Phoenix, San Antonio, New York, Utah, Atlanta and 
Philadelphia. That's a good chunk of the contenders list. 
</P>
<P>
Six more victories would have put the Pistons in select company. Four teams 
(the Rochester Royals, Philadelphia Warriors, New York Knicks and Boston 
Celtics) won 18 straight, and the Milwaukee Bucks and old Washington Capitols 
won 20 in a row. The all-time record is the Lakers' 33 straight from November 
1971 to January 1972. 
</P>
<P>
But the streak wasn't the thing. It's the way Detroit is taking good teams 
apart, at every venue. 
</P>
<P>
For motivation, there's the repeat notion. The Pistons are ahead of their pace 
of last season, when they went 63-19 and lost only two of 17 playoff games. It 
also helps that Los Angeles is on their heels for the best record in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
But, often the Pistons have forgotten about the opponent and figuratively 
played against themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's good to do that," said Dumars. "Sometimes it's not. With this 
team here you just have to play good basketball. But if you get caught up in 
that (playing against the game), you can get in trouble. We just concentrate on 
what we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
Lakers Coach Pat Riley often uses the book "The Art of War" to explain the 
mindset of his team during the past decade. The Pistons make no such analogies. 
They just shut down opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"I read that (book) when (his son) was a kid," said Chuck Daly, the Pistons 
coach who has pushed all the right buttons of late. 
</P>
<P>
Two major factors have been at play. Edwards, who replaced John Salley at 
starting power forward early in the season, has been a stabilizer in the front 
court, allowing Laimbeer to drift out to the foul line and higher to set picks 
or shoot jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
And Dennis Rodman became a starter when Mark Aguirre hurt his back in a Jan. 21 
loss to the Lakers. That's when the Pistons started their run. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Pistons already were leading the league in fewest points allowed 
when the streak began, they've shaved almost a full point off that average, to 
an even 97 per game. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents are shooting a league-low .443. The Pistons have held teams under 100 
points this season a league-high 37 times. And Detroit has won 30 games by 10 
points or more. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so much their quickness out front," Washington guard Darrell Walker 
said, referring to Dumars and Thomas. "Those guys are talented. They're going 
to score some points. I don't care who's guarding them. But I think their 
defense is what's really the key to their basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get in the playoffs, you've got to stop people in a half-court game, 
and they can stop you. Because they're big and they step over and they're 
aggressive and they bump you when you go through the lane. They bump you every 
chance they can bump you. And I think that's what separates them from the rest 
of the teams in the league." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say, " 'God, I have to go out there and work, work, work. I don't 
want to do that,' " Rodman said. "That's an advantage for me." 
</P>
<P>
Now Detroit has the luxury of choosing to go strictly for offense off the bench 
(Aguirre and Vinnie Johnson), or a combination (Aguirre and Salley). Or, as 
they did in the fourth quarter against Chicago last week, the Pistons can still 
go for the full defensive look, leaving Rodman, Dumars and Edwards in with 
Salley. That group, with Johnson, blew out the Bulls in Chicago Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the rush to get on their charter, Roundball One, and get out of 
town. The Pistons are always in a hurry to get to the next game, to get another 
one under their belts and get closer to the playoffs. No music in the locker 
room. Just their trainer, Mike Abdenour, screaming, "Let's go, let's go!" every 
eight seconds or so. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't worry about (other people)," Daly said. "We just do what we do. We 
have a lot of guys who like to compete, like to get out and play. That's all it 
is, is hard work."
