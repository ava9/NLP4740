  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 18 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- Mongolian 
President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat has appealed to the activists 
of the Mongolian Democratic Party and the Mongolian 
Socialist-Democratic Party who are taking part in a hunger 
strike on a central square in the capital to abandon extreme 
measures in the political struggle. Receiving representatives of 
participants in the action, the president spoke of his readiness 
to submit their demands to parliament for examination in order 
to settle the alarming situation as quickly as possible. 
  Opposition forces are insisting on the prime minister's 
resignation, accusing the government of corruption and inability 
to fulfill its promises to bring the country out of crisis. 
  P. Ochirbat has held consultations with the leaders of 
various parties and with the head of the Council of Ministers.
