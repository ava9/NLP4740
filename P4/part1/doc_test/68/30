<F P=106> [Report by Marina Lebedeva and Vladimir Ardayev: "Human </F>
Rights in Conference Hall and Outside It"] 
  [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] -- The International Conference 
on Human Rights, "Public Organizations and Power: Interaction 
in a Democratic Society," has ended in Alma-Ata. 
  The discussion corresponded fully with the main theme of the 
conference. But the "thorniest" aspects inevitably concerned 
events unfolding nearby, outside the conference hall of the 
Alma-Ata sociopolitical center. 
  Formally, following the adoption of the new Constitution and 
the reconstruction of the main legal base, practically no laws 
remain in Kazakhstan which directly violate human rights -- 
human rights must not be violated by law here. But this year's 
elections have shown the weakness and lack of coordination of 
the social associations and their vulnerability before the 
"party in power," something that CSCE observers emphasized, as 
well as the undeveloped state or almost complete absence of 
independent mass media in Kazakhstan. 
  One example confirming the fairness of this analysis came up 
straight away on the first day of the conference's work. On the 
eve of its opening, 16 May, an unsanctioned rally of pickets, 
several of whom had declared a hunger strike, broke out on the 
square outside the building of the parliament, which had 
gathered for the latest stage of its first session. The militia 
drove the hunger strikers out of the square, and five of them 
were arrested. This was prompted by an actual parliament 
decision, which essentially outlawed not only obvious 
demonstrations, but also "other gatherings of citizens." 
  The speech by V. Lyubushkin, a deputy from the North 
Kazakhstan Oblast Council [Maslikhat], devoted to the "Russian 
question," was a dramatic one. He cited "acts of intimidation 
to others," applied by the Kazakhstani authorities toward those 
who are trying to defend the rights of the Russian-speaking 
population, as a state policy distortion that is exacerbating 
this question. Thus, Boris Suprunyuk, chairman of the "Russian 
Community of North Kazakhstan" and a journalist, is under arrest. 
  The conflictual situation arose during the work of the civil 
rights conference with the sociopolitical newspaper 
KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA -- the most popular Russian-language 
publication in the Republic. Quite recently, the "Kazakhstan" 
television and radio broadcasting company was transformed into a 
corporation under the control of the authorities by being merged 
with a private television company -- and a presidential 
representative was appointed in it, in the person of press 
service leader I. Romanov. 
  At IZVESTIYA's request, assessing the conference that has 
ended, Burkutbay Ayaganov, deputy chief of the internal policy 
section in the president's apparatus and the Kazakhstani 
Republic Cabinet of Ministers, who participated in it, called it 
"effective," and said it testified to democratic Kazakhstan's 
desire to become a rule-of-law state. 
  When asked to comment on the cases of the violation of human 
rights which occurred in the past few days outside the 
conference hall, the deputy chief of section answered that he is 
not prepared to do so as he does not have sufficient information 
at his disposal.
