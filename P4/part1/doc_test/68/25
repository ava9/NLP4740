EX-SUSPECT IN MOLEST CASE SUES PRIEST;

<P>
A former youth minister whose three trials for molesting a teen-age boy ended 
in hung juries has sued an Episcopal priest who tape-recorded a confession 
allegedly concerning the sexual allegations. 
</P>
<P>
David Rickard, 40, former youth pastor at St. Jude's Church in Burbank, claims 
in the lawsuit that the church's rector, Father Michael T. Flynn, violated 
Rickard's privacy and the confidentiality of confession. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks that the tape be turned over to Rickard, of Sierra Madre, or 
taken by the court. Also named in the suit, filed Nov. 28 in Burbank Superior 
Court, are St. Jude's and the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 6, Judge Thomas J. Murphy sealed the court record and ordered all those 
involved in the case not to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
Confession is a church rite under which a person admits wrongdoing to a priest 
for the purpose of forgiveness. Such conversations are protected under 
California law, as are conversations between doctors and patients or attorneys 
and clients. 
</P>
<P>
Rickard has denied engaging in a sexual relationship but admitted feelings of 
attraction for the youth. He said Flynn urged him to confess, then misconstrued 
his words. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn, 50, rector at St. Jude's for nine years, declined to comment. Canon 
Bruce MacPherson, a spokesman for the diocese, said that he was unfamiliar with 
details of the case but that tape-recording a confession does not violate 
church policy. 
</P>
<P>
Rickard was tried in 1989 in Redding and in 1989 and 1990 in Pasadena Superior 
Court on 120 charges of oral copulation with a 15-year-old boy who was in 
Rickard's Bible study class. 
</P>
<P>
The youth, now 20 and married, spent time with Rickard in Sierra Madre and 
later, with his parents' permission, moved with Rickard to Northern California 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The parents learned of the alleged sexual relationship in 1987 and notified 
authorities. Charges were dismissed this year in both places after the third 
jury deadlocked in Pasadena in August. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn wrote Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert de Carteret on Nov. 20 about the tape, 
saying it "was probably not admissible in a court of law, but it will be held 
secure for other use should Mr. Rickard's future behavior require its 
utilization." 
</P>
<P>
De Carteret at first said Rickard may have waived his right to confidentiality 
by filing the suit. But he said later that the gag order prevents further 
action by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Rodiger, vice chancellor of the diocese and an attorney, said the diocese 
and the bishop will probably have little role in the lawsuit because Episcopal 
churches are independently run. Each church elects its own clergy, Rodiger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodiger said the lawsuit could center on the legal difference between a 
"confession" and a "conversation." A similar case about 10 years ago in 
Northern California made such a distinction, he said. A woman convicted of 
stealing church money sued her priest, who had reported the theft because he 
interpreted her admission to him as a conversation. She lost. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. Rickard has said previously that he 
spent more than $90,000 defending himself.
