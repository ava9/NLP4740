are set for a comeback in Sunday's elections

The left, fresh from electoral success in Lithuania, Poland, Russia and
Ukraine, is poised for a comeback in Hungary's parliamentary elections next
Sunday. Voters, disillusioned with four years of a conservative coalition
led by the Hungarian Democratic Forum, are turning to the former communists
of the Hungarian Socialist party.
The Socialists, who scored just 11 per cent in the 1990 national vote, have
surged to well over 30 per cent in latest opinion surveys. 'I did believe
the pendulum would swing back. I did not believe that it could swing back so
far,' says Mr Viktor Polgar, head of the Socialists' Budapest campaign.
The Socialist party is the successor to the communist regime that ruled
Hungary, often brutally, for 40 years. Mr Gyula Horn, the 61-year-old
Socialist leader, went to college in the Soviet Union and joined the 'padded
coats,' the volunteers who helped put down the 1956 uprising against
communist rule.
Government television has taken a literal approach to the search for
skeletons in the Socialists' cupboard. One TV documentary covered the search
for prison cells, torture chambers and bones beneath Socialist party
headquarters in Budapest. Another broadcast an account of Mr Horn kicking in
the teeth of a 'counter-revolutionary' prisoner.
But the TV campaign against the Socialists, so close to the vote and so
reliant on unsubstantiated accusation, has lacked credibility. 'The attacks
actually help us,' Mr Andras Bard, Socialist spokesman, admits cheerfully.
In any case, many Hungarians are inclined to forgive and forget. 'People
change,' shrugs Eva, a Forum voter in 1990 and a Socialist supporter now.
Horn the young communist became Horn the reformist foreign minister of the
last communist government, who let East German 'tourists' out through
Hungary to the west and so helped bring down the Berlin wall.
A despairing conservative official asks: 'Do people forget so quickly?' Yes,
the bad things, at any rate. Voters associate the left less with the horrors
of the 1950s and more with the easy going 'goulash communism' that made
Hungary the 'jolliest barracks in the socialist camp'.
'People who lived in places with the toilet at the end of the courtyard were
able to move into a decent tower block and live in civilised surroundings,'
says Mr Istvan Dobrogi, a worker at the light-bulb maker, Tungsram,
pensioned off after General Electric of the US bought the company.
'There was a bathroom. They could pay the elec-tricity bill and the rent,
keep a small plot and main-tain a Trabant. Only a few people can manage that
now.'
Living standards for most pensioners and state employees have fallen over
the last four years as gross domestic product has shrunk by 20 per cent.
Unemployment has now risen to 12.2 per cent of the labour force. Mr Janos
Plyevszky, a car mechanic, complains: 'Now there is no social safety net, at
least then there was. There are terrible layoffs. They turn off the
electricity if people can't pay.'
Electricity bills do not preoccupy the mobile phone wielding drivers in
Mercedes cars who cruise through central Budapest past boutiques, western
brand-name stores, gleaming new hotels and banks. But the new rich are few
and their conspicuous consumption, though impressive to foreigners, is
galling to many less fortunate locals.
Only 18 per cent of Hungarians polled say they are better off than before,
fewer than in any other east European country except Russia. The
conservative government takes a leaf out of the standard practice for
beleaguered western governments and argues that recession has been as bad,
if not worse, among all Hungary's eastern neighbours.
To no avail. 'Before the collapse of communism Hungarians compared
themselves to Romania and they thought they were doing well,' says Mr Peter
Tolgyessy, a prominent politician of the liberal Free Democrats. 'Now they
compare themselves with Austria.'
The Socialists are the beneficiaries of the public's disgruntlement. 'We get
our support from the fact that most people have had it up to here,' says Mr
Polgar.
It is not fair, respond Hungary's increasingly despondent conservatives. It
was the communist regime that built up eastern Europe's highest per capita
debt and left their successors to repay it. 'For years and years we consumed
more than we produced,' says Mr Tamas Katona, state secretary at the prime
minister's office. 'Ordinary people are paying the price for the previous
system.' And the conservatives, he might have added.
