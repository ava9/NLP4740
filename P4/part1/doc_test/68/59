</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The politics of national pride that carried Joszef Antall and his Hungarian 
Democratic Forum to victory reflect a conservative sweep across Eastern Europe 
as Moscow's former satellites realign themselves toward the West. 
</P>
<P>
But the center-right Forum's success in striking an anti-leftist chord in an 
electorate long suppressed by socialism may prove difficult to duplicate among 
the strong liberal and leftist opposition it will face in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Radio announced Tuesday that the nation's first democratically 
elected legislature will convene May 7 or 8 to swear in the next prime 
minister, widely expected to be Antall, and a new Cabinet to replace the 
Socialist caretakers who won less than 10% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist parties that had dominated Eastern Europe since the end of World 
War II suffered similarly in elections in Poland last year and in East Germany 
last month, showing a pronounced desire among the newly liberated to break with 
the ideology of the left. Conservative parties are also expected to do well in 
Romania and Czechoslovakia when free elections are held there later this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarians were swept by the rightist tide, but their reasons for choosing the 
Forum and its even more conservative allies differ somewhat from those in other 
states recently cut loose from the Kremlin's tether. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian conservatives won favor by stirring up nostalgia for the agrarian 
past and feelings of national pride that were stifled under communism. 
</P>
<P>
They enjoyed their strongest support in rural regions, especially in the 
eastern part of the country, where promises of land reform and a return to 
"Christian democracy" appealed to voters. 
</P>
<P>
Blue-collar workers also preferred the party led by Antall, a stern but 
fatherly figure who advocates a measured reform pace that may prevent or delay 
mass unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Among Hungarian intellectuals and professionals, however, the Forum raises 
concern about a rise of nationalism that could touch off further ethnic 
conflicts abroad like the mid-March clashes with Romanians in Transylvania that 
killed at least eight and injured hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
Antall told a cheering crowd Monday that his government will champion the 
causes of 15 million Hungarians, referring to the ethnic minorities in 
neighboring countries as well as the 10.5 million who live in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders from both the Forum and the Free Democrats, who finished a distant 
second in the vote, have promised to bury the campaign hatchet and work 
together for the good of a democratic Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
"All those passions and feelings of injury and hurt and insult will belong to 
the past, and those who have come out as winners can behave moderately from 
their victorious position," Antall told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the best of intentions, the parties have emerged from a hotly contested 
and often negative election battle with wounds and grudges that may need more 
than words to heal. 
</P>
<P>
Free Democratic opponents charged that Forum candidates engaged in a smear 
campaign against them which they said took on an anti-Semitic tone at times. 
</P>
<P>
Several election posters depicting Free Democratic leader Janos Kis and other 
Jewish candidates were defaced with swastikas, and deputy Forum leader Istvan 
Csurka was accused of making openly anti-Semitic remarks during campaign 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Antall and other Forum leaders have denied that any anti-Jewish sentiment 
permeates their party. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary election results show the Forum with 165 seats and its likely 
coalition partners, the Independent Smallholders Party and the Christian 
Democrats, with 43 and 21 mandates respectively. That gives the 
coalition-in-the-making a comfortable majority in the 386-member Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
(The release of official final results will be delayed by voting irregularities 
in several districts, Janos Nemeth, chairman of the National Electoral 
Committee, told reporters Tuesday. An announcement of final results had been 
expected by Tuesday. Nemeth said they would be released later, but did not say 
when. He said the irregularities would be investigated.) 
</P>
<P>
The conservative alliance that Antall said Tuesday would take at least a couple 
of weeks to iron out will face a sizable, if fragmented, opposition force. 
</P>
<P>
The left-leaning Alliance of Free Democrats will have 92 deputies, their allied 
youth group Fidesz 21 and the Socialists 33. 
</P>
<P>
Antall's party advocates a slow but sure pace of reform to bring about a market 
economy without inflicting too many hardships on the nation already suffering 
20% annual inflation and rising unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Antall, 58, rose from virtual obscurity to head Hungary's new political 
vanguard on the strength of his role in talks last year between the Socialist 
government and opposition groups, which ushered in the peaceful transition to 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
He was courted by the Small-holders and the Christian Democrats for their party 
leaderships, but chose to head the Forum's election drive because he said it 
best combined Hungarian patriotism, economic liberalism and Christian values. 
</P>
<P>
The Smallholders, whose support is vital to the Forum's effort to control 
Parliament, appear eager to play a role in government. Party leaders said they 
expect to be given the Agriculture Ministry among its Cabinet assignments, to 
make good on a campaign promise of land reform. 
</P>
<P>
"We can only meet these promises if we take part in the government," 
Smallholders campaign manager Joszef Torgyan told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Antall said the two parties basically agreed on land policy but that details of 
the plan were among the issues that would take a few weeks to resolve in 
coalition talks. 
</P>
<P>
The Smallholders have proposed restoration of private property according to 
1947 land registers, but the Forum and other parties have deemed their idea 
unworkable.
