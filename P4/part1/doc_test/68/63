<P>
Carlos Saul Menem, a flamboyant populist promising a "productive revolution," 
won the Argentine presidency in a landslide Sunday on the strength of public 
anger over the nation's worst economic crisis in nearly a century. 
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old Menem trounced Eduardo Cesar Angeloz of President Raul 
Alfonsin's ruling Radical party by a margin of about 49% to 38%, according to 
unofficial results of three-fourths of the ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Angeloz, governor of Cordoba province, lost in nearly every district of the 
country and was fighting even to win his own province. 
</P>
<P>
In capturing the presidency for the Peronist party for the first time since 
1973, Menem successfully muted lingering fears of Peronism and turned the 
campaign into a vote on Alfonsin's economic failings -- inflation is surging at 
an annual rate of 3,000%, the Argentine currency has plummeted and workers' 
buying power has disintegrated. 
</P>
<P>
Turnout was about 85% of the 20 million eligible voters. Partial returns had 
Menem ahead with 6.1 million votes, compared to 4.7 million for Angeloz. The 
conservative Center Alliance of Alvaro Alsogaray had 7% of the vote -- less 
than expected -- with the rest split among minor candidates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Control Legislature 
</P>
<P>
The Peronists, who already control the Senate, also apparently won a majority 
in the lower house of Congress, giving Menem a friendly legislature for his 
plan to achieve a vaguely defined "productive revolution" -- raising salaries, 
reactivating industry, reducing a huge deficit and tackling inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was regarded as a crucial step in the consolidation of democratic rule 
in Argentina, where six coups have broken the constitutional order since 1930. 
When Alfonsin's successor takes office in December, it will be the first 
genuinely democratic transition of power from one elected president to another 
in 61 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Today all Argentines were the winners," said Alfonsin, whose election in 1983 
ended a brutal seven-year military dictatorship and formed part of a trend 
toward restored civilian rule across the continent. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Peronists poured into the streets of the capital to celebrate in a 
steady rain, pounding drums and chanting odes to Juan D. Peron, who founded the 
party in the mid-1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Menem was virtually assured of a clear-cut electoral college majority, thus 
avoiding months of potentially bitter maneuvering for support before the 
electors' meeting on Aug. 10 to choose the winner. 
</P>
<P>
From his home in the small province of La Rioja, where he serves as governor, 
Menem said, "I've defeated an adversary, but I've regained a friend." 
</P>
<P>
Angeloz called Menem to concede defeat and congratulate him. 
</P>
<P>
Menem said: "I have faith and hope that things are going to start to go better 
in this country." 
</P>
<P>
He quoted Juan Peron, saying, "To govern is to give work," and added: "Here 
there will be no possibility of speculation, of usury. Let's end this Argentina 
where those who do nothing live well and those who work every day of the year 
live badly." 
</P>
<P>
The constitution barred Alfonsin from seeking reelection. Despite widespread 
approval of the entrenchment of civil liberties during his six-year term, 
public disaffection is widespread over his economic failures. One of the 
world's 10 wealthiest countries in the 1930, Argentina has lately fallen 
further into the ranks of the Third World, with its foreign debt soaring to 
nearly $60 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The voting proceeded smoothly, with no complaints of irregularities. Argentine 
elections are regarded as among the fairest in Latin America, with observers 
from all parties overseeing every step of the process. 
</P>
<P>
Menem, who spent five years in jail during the last dictatorship, said after 
casting his ballot: "The important thing is that the Argentine people can 
exercise the fundamental right to choose." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Working-Class Base 
</P>
<P>
The son of Syrian immigrants who converted from Islam to Catholicism, Menem 
galvanized the working-class base of the Peronist party, a social movement that 
defies ideological labels. An amateur race car driver and pilot who is often 
photographed with starlets, Menem avoided specifics on how he would right the 
foundering economy or on how far he would go in dismantling the state 
domination of the economy begun by Peron. 
</P>
<P>
Menem emphasized the "renovation" of the Peronist party, formally known as the 
Justicialist Party, since the days when Peron dictated every decision. Menem 
helped engineer internal party reforms, including an open primary that he won 
in an upset last July, which he said ended the party's authoritarian 
traditions. 
</P>
<P>
With a sonorous voice and bushy sideburns reminiscent of 19th-Century 
provincial political bosses, Menem enthralled rallies with his appeal to 
"Follow me! To end the hunger of the poor children, and the sadness of the rich 
children! I will not defraud you!" 
</P>
<P>
Still, uncertainty over Menem's intentions and memories of the Peronists' 
combative past combined to kept the number of undecided voters relatively high. 
</P>
<P>
Peron ruled from 1946-55 with the help of his charismatic second wife, Eva 
(Evita) Peron, until he fell in a coup. He returned to office in 1973 and, upon 
his death less than a year later, was succeeded by his third wife and vice 
president, Maria Estela Peron. She was ousted in 1976 at a time of 
hyper-inflation, strikes and left-wing violence. 
</P>
<P>
Angeloz, who promised to privatize deficit-ridden state-run enterprises and to 
modernize the economy, sought to portray Menem as a throwback to past Peronist 
reliance on the state to solve the nation's ills. 
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old governor, a gruff-voiced career politician regarded as a 
capable if dour administrator, was nearly as critical of Radical party policies 
as he was of Peronism. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonsin constantly faced conflict with the military over human rights abuses 
during the previous regime, and he suffered through three military rebellions 
in the past two years and a leftist guerrilla attack against a military base in 
January. Many analysts expect some sort of military amnesty in the months or 
years ahead to ease tensions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Memory of Perons 
</P>
<P>
The memory of Juan and Evita Peron was more than a sentimental factor for many 
voters. In the Villa Urquiza neighborhood of the capital, 74-year-old Juana 
Bottini de Rossini pointed to a graffiti-stained stone pedestal in a park 
across from the voting station and said, "That was a bust of Evita until they 
pulled it down after the 1955 coup. 
</P>
<P>
"This barrio was founded by Peron, it was called Barrio Peron, and Evita 
designed this park. They provided houses for the poor. If Peron had stayed in 
power, there would be none of the slums that we have in Buenos Aires now." 
</P>
<P>
She said Peron had given the workers free vacations, social benefits and 
pensions. 
</P>
<P>
"Now Menem is going to do the same for us," she said.
