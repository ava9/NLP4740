  [Text] Cairo, June 25 (AFP) -- Thirty-three lawyers have 
gone on a hunger strike in solidarity with one of their senior 
colleagues, who is demanding publication of a report into the 
death of a lawyer in police custody, one of the strikers said 
Saturday [25 June]. 
  'Abd-al-'Aziz Muhammad, head of the Bar Association, began 
his hunger strike to demand publication of the document a week 
ago. He has been in hospital since Monday [20 June] after his 
condition deteriorated. 
  Hunger striker Halah 'Abd-al-'Aziz told AFP: "Eighteen 
lawyers, including three women, have been on hunger strike since 
Wednesday [22 June] or Thursday [23 June], in the Bar 
Association headquarters in Cairo, and 15 others joined the 
movement Friday [24 June] at Ismailiya and Port Said," on the 
Suez Canal. She said the lawyers, from diverse political 
groups, will continue their hunger strike "until death, or until 
the satisfaction of the demands" put by Muhammad. 
  Muhammad has called on the government to release an official 
report into the death in April of 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, an 
Islamic lawyer. Madani died in police custody. Authorities say 
an asthma attack was to blame, but the Bar Association charged 
that he died under torture. 
  Muhammad is also demanding the release of 24 lawyers 
arrested 
in May during a rally to protest Madani's death. 
  Egyptian newspapers have reported that the Bar Association 
head had recently discovered the contents of an official report 
into Madani's death, which noted "injury marks on Madani's body." 
  "That casts doubt on the causes of death of the lawyer, 
which 
could have a criminal origin," 'Aziz said. 
  The 40,000-member Bar Association, controlled by the Muslim 
Brotherhood, has come under fire recently from the Egyptian 
authorities.
