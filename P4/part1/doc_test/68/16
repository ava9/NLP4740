  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 21 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- Mongolia's 
leading political parties today signed a conciliation document 
aimed at overcoming the acute political crisis in the country 
which is in its second week. In the presence of President 
Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat, leaders of the three parliamentary 
parties -- the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the 
Mongolian National Democratic Party, and the Mongolian Social 
Democratic Party -- signed the document. 
  The document, called `Political Consensus', stipulates in 
particular that at its spring and fall sessions parliament 
should adopt laws on public rallies and demonstrations, on free 
speech, freedom of the media, on the moral code of officials, 
and on fighting corruption. 
  The present crisis broke out 13 April after the Mongolian 
Democratic Union and a number of other opposition parties 
started mass actions in support of their demands for the 
government's resignation. They insisted that its socioeconomic 
program has failed and that it is unable to lead the country out 
of the crisis. They also called on the law enforcement agencies 
to urgently investigate all the accusations of corruption and 
abuse of power made against top officials. 
  Representatives of the opposition continue their hunger 
strike on the capital's central square until their demands are 
met. Supporters of the present government have also staged their 
own hunger strike. They have already refused food for six days 
now and state that they will end their hunger strike only after 
the opposition does the same. 
  At the same time, the conflicting sides continue their mass 
rallies. `Free microphones' are installed in the public places 
for all those wishing to express their opinions on the issues 
they are concerned about.
