WITH BREATHTAKING SPEED, THE EAST BLOC HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED. BUT THE STRUGGLE 
IS NOT OVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Trotsky or Mao or Che Guevara might have said in another context, the 
struggle continues. 
</P>
<P>
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, after four months as the first non-Communist prime minister 
of Poland, looks as tired as he did the day he told Lech Walesa he would take 
the job. Walesa went to Washington and became one of three foreigners who were 
not heads of state to have addressed a joint session of Congress. He was given 
a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki went to the Kremlin for his first Warsaw Pact summit conference, 
flanked by his old antagonists, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski and Mieczyslaw 
Rakowski, who seemed proud to have him along. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian prime minister, Miklos Nemeth, is only 44, but is weary also, 
perhaps a lame duck, and is deeply uncertain about Hungary's economic future as 
a soon-to-be parliamentary democracy. Having arrived at its threshold with 
relative ease, the nation seems disinterested in politics and dispirited over a 
declining economy. 
</P>
<P>
Egon Krenz has come and gone, replaced last weekend in East Berlin by Gregor 
Gysi, at 41 the youngest party leader in Eastern Europe. He is a defender of 
the rights of opposition parties and reconciled to early free elections and 
their probable result -- the end to Communist leadership in East Germany. Erich 
Honecker, expelled from the party, is under house arrest and may, along with 
others who served with him, face formal charges of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Petar Mladenov has thrown the hard-liners off the Bulgarian Politburo and, if 
demonstrations in Sofia continue, may have to go soon himself. Todor Zhivkov's 
33 luxury villas have been turned over to the use of schools, youth scouting 
groups and medical clinics. 
</P>
<P>
In Prague, Ladislav Adamec resigned as prime minister and a new government 
chief, Marian Calfa, 43, last Sunday formed a government with Communists in the 
minority. Among the new ministers are a number of the old government's former 
prisoners. A deputy prime minister, Jan Carnogursky, who got out of jail only 
three weeks ago, will help supervise the Interior Ministry, which controls the 
state police. Free elections are expected in June. Milos Jakes, in a state of 
apparent bewilderment, wandered off beyond the sidelines and was heard no more. 
Gustav Husak resigned as president. Vaclav Havel, in jail this year from 
January to May, was regarded as his most likely successor. 
</P>
<P>
How did it happen? A comment now making the rounds in Eastern Europe says it 
took 10 years in Poland, 10 months in Hungary, 10 weeks in East Germany and 10 
days in Czechoslovakia -- and when the time does come, it will take 10 hours or 
10 minutes in Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Did it start with Poland in January, or when the elections that showed 
Communists could relinquish power -- would have to relinquish power -- without 
blood in the streets? Would East Germany's leaders have gone, and then 
Czechoslovakia's, if the Hungarians had not been determined to tear down their 
border fence? Would any of it have happened without Mikhail Gorbachev? Or would 
there have been a Gorbachev without a Communist system in terminal crisis? 
</P>
<P>
When news got out that the Hungarians wanted to remove the red star from atop 
the Parliament building, 18 companies submitted bids to do it for free. A 
French firm offered to buy it for $60,000. Only the French could spot a trend 
so fast: Fashion's thirst for nostalgia claims a symbol of repression, hated by 
millions, and makes it trivial. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, the red star will go without lament, because it was not trivial. In 
Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria, 90 million people 
lived under it for 40 years, with another 22 million in Romania still waiting. 
It ruined rivers, forests and lives without number, and the damage it brought 
cannot be calculated. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1989, though, some accounting was about to begin, and a start on 
a new era of history for Eastern Europe.
