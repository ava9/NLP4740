<F P=106> [Report by Roberto Reyes on interview with Honduran </F>
President Carlos Roberto Reina by unidentified reporters at the 
Government House in Tegucigalpa on 20 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] We have remarks by President Carlos Roberto Reina 
referring to the Honduran Government's and Army's plan to modify 
the 40-year-old treaty dealing with U.S. military aid for 
Honduras. The president spoke about this initiative, which he 
said is not official. Asked why the Armed Forces rather than 
the executive branch took the initiative on this, he said the 
source of the initiative does not matter. Here is President 
Carlos Roberto Reina: 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter, in progress] ...the Honduran 
Government's initiative to modify the Military Assistance Treaty 
with the United States. 
  [Reina] Statements have been made. They are not official. 
The issue is going to be discussed by Honduran Government 
officials and also by the various government branches. These 
agreements were implemented at a time when there was a different 
situation in the world. It was the time of the Cold War and the 
polarization of states and minds. It is a phase that has been 
completely overcome. The new agenda is one of coming together in 
favor of mankind. At the right time, in agreement with U.S. 
Government representatives, we will sit down to review these 
agreements and treaties, some of which are very old, dating back 
40 years. In this way, we will be able to update the forms of 
cooperation in all fields with the great democracy represented 
by the United States of America and its excellent president, Mr. 
Bill Clinton. 
  [Reporter] When would this take place? We spoke with the 
U.S. ambassador just a few moments ago, and he said they are 
ready to begin reviewing these agreements. 
  [Reina] If U.S. Government representatives, who are very 
honorably represented by Mr. Pryce, are ready, at any time you 
might hear news that we are sitting down to review the 
agreements to which some protocols were added at times of great 
tension in Central America and the world. 
  [Reporter] What would [words indistinct]. 
  [Reina] The subject is military. These are military 
agreements. Cooperation is now more directed toward human 
development. That is one way of beginning to address the 
problem of the military presence. 
  [Reporter] The question the people are most interested in is 
the issue of the Palmerola military base. Will this base 
continue to operate in Honduras or will the U.S. troops leave? 
  [Reina] We return to the same topic: the presence of that 
base, which is legally Honduran. Its name is the Soto Cano 
base. It is under the sponsorship of the Honduran Government. 
It was established at a time of great tension for Honduras and 
Central America. It is logical that we review and update the 
structure of cooperation. At that time, it was believed 
cooperation should be military, because tensions were so great. 
  We think that at present cooperation should involve other 
areas, such as environment, health, education, human rights, and 
drug trafficking. For example, we must not allow this scourge 
known as drug trafficking to continue to hurt Honduras. In this 
regard, I will say this to the ambassador and to you: We are 
your ally in waging a frontal assault against scourges that 
cause so much damage to humanity. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, this has been interpreted as an 
initiative of the military institution and not of the executive 
branch, as it should be. 
  [Reina] A military issue is involved. They are also part of 
Honduras. They are an institution, constitutionally speaking. 
They took an initiative. Now is the time to resume discussions 
without innuendoes and without pulling out cards from under the 
table. 
  [Reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [Reina] They proposed a review. The ambassador said he 
agrees, and I also fully agree. The Congress must review this. 
I wonder if you recall -- if you have a good memory -- that 
there was much discussion when the protocols came up. In my 
opinion, those protocols should have been brought before the 
National Congress, because constitutionally speaking, military 
issues should be (?discussed) at the National Congress. 
  [Reporter] When will such a discussion take place? 
  [Reina] They will take place in more calm times, in times of 
less confrontation and very sincere cooperation. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] U.S. ambassador that there is 
a possibility that, once the Southern Command closes down, some 
soldiers from that base might be transferred to the Palmerola 
Base? 
  [Reina] I think you are moving ahead of the negotiations and 
discussions. This is theoretical. This issue should be 
discussed and its approval should be in keeping with the 
interests of our power [nuestro poder]. 
  [Reporter]) I would like to change the topic, Mr. President. 
How does the people's constant criticisms, justified or not, 
about the energy crisis facing the country harm or suffocate 
your government? 
  [Reina] It is unfair to criticize the government for this 
crisis. The government, which is only three months old, did not 
create this crisis. We are trying to resolve it quickly. This 
crisis is the result of mistakes made by serveral past 
administrations. We will not take revenge by claiming only the 
previous government made mistakes. Any lack of foresight and 
problems linked to the Francisco Morazan Dam must be resolved by 
this government. It is completely unfair to criticize the 
government for trying to resolve these problems. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] declare an emergency over this 
energy crisis, because the [words indistinct]. 
  [Reina] I am not trying to lay blame. I am trying to say 
that it is unfair to criticize us, because we are trying to find 
a solution. I spoke to the minister of [word indistinct] today. 
The chief of the ENEE [National Enterprise for Electric Power] 
is abroad looking for aid from friendly countries. Everyone 
must help resolve this crisis. 
  Using this as a political tool against the government is 
totally unfair and absurd. We are the ones who will resolve 
this problem. We did not decree an emergency. There is an 
emergency because blackouts are seriously damaging the country's 
economy. We want to resolve this problem as soon as possible. 
This morning, I made some decisions to ensure [words 
indistinct] before 10 May. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] privileged areas. 
  [Reina] I have fought for justice all my life. I am not 
going to shy away from the problems of the Honduran people. [end
