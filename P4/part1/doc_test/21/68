Jose Antonio Rodriguez Porth, an ultra-right-wing ideologue who was one of 
President Alfredo Cristiani's closest advisers, was assassinated here Friday 
nine days after taking office as presidential chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
The 73-year-old Rodriguez Porth, whose formal title was minister of the 
presidency, was shot to death at 8:10 a.m. (7:10 PDT) just as he was entering a 
station wagon parked in front of his house in the La Mascota district of the 
city. His driver, Juan Gilberto Clara Carranza, and his groundskeeper, Benjamin 
Perez, also died. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvadoran government, the military and U.S. Ambassador William G. Walker 
all blamed the deaths on the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, a 
Marxist guerrilla movement that has fought a nine-year civil war here. They 
charged that the rebels are trying to provoke a violent right-wing reaction 
that would endanger the massive U.S. aid program for El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Widow's Suggestion 
</P>
<P>
However, a guerrilla spokesman in Mexico City told the British news agency 
Reuters that "it is almost impossible" that the FMLN, as the rebels are called, 
carried out the murders. And Rodriguez Porth's widow suggested the killers 
could have been "terrorists from the right." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez Porth, a founder and one-time director general of Cristiani's ruling 
Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena party), was the second senior member of 
the party to be assassinated in the last two months. Atty. Gen. Roberto Garcia 
Alvarado died April 19 when his car was bombed. In addition, an unsuccessful 
attempt was made April 14 on the life of Vice President Jose Francisco Merino. 
</P>
<P>
Although they deny responsibility for these attacks, the rebels have pledged to 
make El Salvador "ungovernable" under Cristiani's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference at the end of the day, Cristiani said the killing of 
Rodriquez Porth demonstrates that the "dark forces" of the FMLN "don't want 
peace, nor reconciliation, nor agreement nor progress for the country." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Punishment Vowed 
</P>
<P>
In reply to questions about a possible violent government or Arena reaction, 
the president stressed that "we are going to respond under the law . . . and 
punish those responsible for this crime . . . but we will not be provoked into 
sinking the country into a whirlpool of violence." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez Porth was a natural target for the rebels. Over the years, first as a 
lawyer and a member of the country's wealthy business establishment, then as a 
law professor, diplomat and official of Arena, he was a bitter critic of any 
opponent of right-wing policies. He consistently advocated hard-line action 
against the National University for supposedly harboring FMLN supporters. 
</P>
<P>
A close friend who held similar opinions, Francisco L. Peccorini, was shot to 
death March 15. The FMLN acknowledged killing Peccorini, a dual 
American-Salvadoran citizen who had retired from teaching philosophy at Cal 
State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez Porth, who served as foreign minister during a right-wing military 
dictatorship in the late 1970s, probably was best known to the public for his 
almost daily denunciations of former President Jose Napoleon Duarte, whom he 
called a Communist dupe. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, although he had been an unrelenting advocate of hard-handed suppression of 
the FMLN, Rodriguez Porth last week called for talks with the guerrillas to end 
the civil war. It was this that led his widow to say Friday that he could have 
been murdered by the right. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's killings clearly were well planned. As the official walked the 20 feet 
from his front door of his house at 240 La Mascota St. to the Jeep Cherokee 
parked at the curb, the killer sat on a motorcycle about 50 yards away. He 
evidently knew that Rodriguez Porth never used bodyguards and left for work at 
the same time nearly every day. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Rodriguez Porth clambered into the back seat of the car and the two 
other men were walking to the front doors, the motorcycle drove up and stopped. 
Watched by a jogger only 90 feet away and two housekeepers from a home across 
the street, the killer calmly but quickly walked to the curb-side and fired 
three shots into Rodriguez Porth's upper right chest. 
</P>
<P>
He turned and shot Perez once and Carranza twice and then climbed onto his 
idling motorcycle and drove away as Perez's wife and small child came to the 
door. The roar of the departing motorcycle did not drown out the sound of the 
child crying "Papita, papita." 
</P>
<P>
The attack was over in less than two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to reporters, Ambassador Walker said that the killing was 
"an act of mindless terror . . . that fits the pattern of other recent 
terrorist attacks and killings." 
</P>
<P>
That, he said, is to "do something so atrocious, so provocative, so repugnant 
that the government, or others, must retaliate." The "others" Walker mentioned 
are the right-wing death squads that killed thousands of FMLN supporters and 
other anti-government critics in the early 1980s. Many Arena leaders are widely 
suspected of involvement in the death squads, which were responsible for 17 
killings during the first four months of this year, according to the human 
rights office of the Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the guerrillas proposed last month to call off attacks on government 
and Arena leaders if Roberto D'Aubuisson, another founder of the party and one 
whose name is most often linked with the death squads, were tried for the 1980 
assassination of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero. The offer was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the White House issued a statement saying that President Bush 
"strongly condemns the vicious murder" and "again calls on extremist groups to 
put an end to the violence in El Salvador, noting that only through the 
renunciation of terrorism and war, and the acceptance of democracy, will there 
be peace." 
</P>
<P>
"The president noted a pattern of violence against government officials in El 
Salvador by those who seek to destroy the democratic gains made in that 
country," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Walker said he expects the government to pursue the killer "within the 
legal system," powerful Arena leaders were speaking of revenge within an hour 
of Rodriguez Porth's death. 
</P>
<P>
"We are facing outright terrorism," said Sigifredo Ochoa Perez, a former army 
colonel who once led a military mutiny against Duarte's government. "They are 
troglodytes, and the only way to make them understand is to fight fire with 
fire."
