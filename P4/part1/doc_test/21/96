Opposition congressmen are accusing Mexico's ambassador to the United States, 
Gustavo Petricioli, of having "turned a blind eye" on illegal trading in the 
Mexican stock market while he served as secretary of finance in the Cabinet of 
former President Miguel de la Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
The congressmen charge that the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) 
is covering up for Petricioli by blocking their efforts to bring action against 
him for failing to act on complaints that major brokerage houses provoked a 
1987 market crash that wiped out tens of thousands of investors here. 
</P>
<P>
In February, after being in power for less than three months, the government of 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari jailed four prominent stockbrokers for 
alleged irregular operations in the stock market. Officials are said to be 
investigating 152 other brokers. 
</P>
<P>
The jailed brokers, including financier Eduardo Legorreta, who reportedly 
contributed heavily to Salinas' presidential campaign last year, are accused of 
trading expired treasury certificates, buying and selling stock without the 
authorization of their clients and other violations. 
</P>
<P>
"Petricioli knew of these irregularities and allowed them to pass; he turned a 
blind eye," said Ciro Mayen Mayen, a Socialist member of the Chamber of 
Deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry issued a statement Feb. 22 saying that Petricioli 
"energetically and categorically rejects the unfounded insinuations that 
authorities of the past government may have been negligent or avoided or 
covered up irregular activities of some stock brokerages and their officials." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laws Tightened 
</P>
<P>
Petricioli said that the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit took a number of 
steps against brokerage houses from mid-1986 to the end of his term in 
November, 1988. He said the government tightened laws regulating the market and 
initiated the investigation that led the Salinas administration to make the 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
PRI leaders charge that the opposition is trying to discredit Petricioli 
because of his role in helping to renegotiate Mexico's foreign debt. During 
last year's presidential campaign, the leftist parties called for a moratorium 
on debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican Socialist Party led the move this week in the Chamber of Deputies 
to charge Petricioli with negligence under a law governing public servants. 
Violation of the law is considered a political rather than criminal offense, 
and the penalty is to be barred from public service. 
</P>
<P>
To support their case, the leftist deputies produced three documents, including 
a May, 1988, report by the Federal Securities Commission recommending that the 
secretary of finance impose sanctions against two firms, including Legorreta's 
house, Operadora de Bolsa, for illegal transactions with treasury certificates. 
</P>
<P>
They also produced a November, 1988, letter from Sergio Garcia Ramirez, who was 
then the attorney general, informing Petricioli of apparently illegal 
activities in the stock market. Enclosed with the letter was a list of 35 
complaints against brokerages. The letter said federal attorneys had informed 
Garcia Ramirez that there was sufficient evidence to file criminal charges. By 
law, the secretary of finance must ask the attorney general to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Petricioli responded to the letter on Nov. 28, two days before the end of the 
presidential term, saying that stock market operations are complex and that the 
diverse charges require further study. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of the Mexican Socialist Party, the Chamber of Deputies formed a 
subcommittee to study the case. 
</P>
<P>
A PRI majority on the subcommittee determined that there was not enough 
evidence to charge Petricioli, but the opposition called the PRI resolution 
unilateral and drafted a resolution of its own. The two resolutions are to be 
considered later by the full Constitutional and Judicial Committee, and the PRI 
majority is expected to approve its own resolution.
