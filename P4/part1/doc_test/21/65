<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Enrique Ortez Colindres, adviser </F>
to Honduran President Reina and Liberal Party spokesman, with 
Alfredo Villaclara -- live] 
  [Text] [Villaclara] We are in touch Lawyer Enrique Ortez 
Colindres, adviser to the president. Is this sort of warning, 
made even at the United nations -- as revealed by Deputy Luis 
Lagos [regarding a possible coup d'etat in Honduras] -- possible 
at this stage of the process to consolidate Honduran democracy? 
Good morning, Dr. Ortez. 
  [Ortez] Good morning, HRN.. I thank you for being so kind 
to call me, because I would like to comment in two capacities, 
as the official Liberal Party spokesman and as an adviser to the 
Presidency of the Republic. It is also worthwhile to say -- I 
hope without seeming pedantic, because I am trying to shed light 
on this case -- that I also speak as former Honduran ambassador 
to the United Nations. 
  I want to tell you that about 160 countries are represented 
at the United Nations, and its members can talk about anything 
from A to Z. In the assemblies and committees, anyone can talk 
about robberies, human rights violations, marijuana, cocaine, 
and gunrunning. Anything goes. 
  Nevertheless, I do not see how any credence can be given to 
a 
coup d'etat in a country as serious as ours; a country that 
installed a new government, which is supported by the people, 
not even 100 days ago. I see no possibility of that, and I will 
tell you why. 
  First, the Honduran Army took an oath and promised to obey 
the people's mandate. You could say they offered to do just 
that under several governments that were dealt coups d'etat. 
But I want to ask you whether there could be a coup d'etat -- 
you who know Honduras -- 90 days after a party as strong as the 
Liberal Party assumed power. I want to ask you if there could be 
a coup when 1 million Liberals are ready to defend this 
government. What de facto government could achieve stability 
given the current circumstances if even strong governments led 
by tyrants, as was the case in Panama, could not achieve it? 
You also saw what happened in Nicaragua. You see what is 
happening in some South American countries and in Haiti, where 
they have been unable to consolidate themselves. 
  At present, with the resolutions issued by the United 
Nations, which brings the international community together, it 
is difficult for any John Doe to break constitutional order and 
stay in power. I think that the time for coups is over. Why? 
Because if support is what is needed at this time, we are 
capable of showing support. We will make the call within the 
party and we will urge the 1 million people who supported Dr. 
Carlos Roberto Reina to make a show of force. You will see what 
kind of party the Liberal Party is. 
  It would not be the first time we faced a coup. What has 
happened when someone dared do carry one out? Corrupt 
governments that brought virtual destitution to our country were 
installed. Thus, I do not think it would be possible -- in light 
of the international situation -- because there would be no 
support for it. I do not think it will happen because the Army 
is obedient. I do not think it could happen because the Army 
lacks a leadership capable of ousting a democratic government 
supported by 1 million Liberals and people who believe in 
democracy. It would be the suicide not of the Liberal 
government but of the Armed Forces. There are intelligent people 
in the Armed Forces. 
  Believe me Rene, I have noticed that selfish interests -- 
the interests of corruption, of sinecures, of all those who have 
been on the payroll, all those who today are not enjoying 
privileges from the government because we are implementing a new 
system -- are trying to promote unrest. I can assure you that 
this will not happen. As a member of the Liberal Party and as 
official spokesman, I urge the Honduran people, especially the 
members of the Liberal Party, to express their support for the 
government, whose only crime is trying to end corruption and 
establish a new system of government. It is obvious that the 
wounded have joined forces because they know that a moral 
revolution is on and that dishonest people will be put in jail 
because the Honduran people have elected a completely different 
person. We can see in the media -- spoken and written -- that 
they are trying to exploit the discontent that exists in the 
country. 
  Carlos Roberto Reina is not God and he cannot perform 
miracles. Our country was completely sacked. In December alone, 
1 million pesos were distributed in transfers using the people's 
funds. The previous administration supposedly subsidized 
kerosene, while three big fish stole the people's money. The 
previous government sacked Injupen [Retirement and Pensions 
Institute], so now the 50,000 houses that were to be built for 
young people will not be built as quickly as planned. The 
project will not be canceled. According to the director of that 
institute, only 500,000 lempiras were left. When I was 
government minister, the contributions and savings of public 
employees totaled $1 billion, but those funds were misused in 
risky projects. Land that had been purchased for 1.14 [currency 
not specified] per square meter was sold the following day for 
200 or 300 lempiras per square meter, stealing 40 to 42 million 
in each of those operations. All this will be uncovered, 
because this government will make decisions. 
  Therefore, I ask the Honduran people and Liberal Party 
members to remain calm but to be alert, because those who 
lost....[pauses] I am not even blaming the National Party, which 
suffered the defeat, but people and groups that held sinecure 
jobs in the past and lived like parasites on the national 
budget. They are defending their interests and attacking the 
government to negotiate those shameful salaries that previous 
administrations paid at the expense of the Honduran people.
