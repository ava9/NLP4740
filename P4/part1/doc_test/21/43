<F P=106> [Report by Marta Marina Gonzalez and Arquimedes Gonzalez] </F>
  [Text] Santiago Rivas Betancourt is 27 years old and 
allegedly one of the terrorists who were supposed to kill 
Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina for $400,000. He told 
BARRICADA: "I have never had anything to do with such a plan. I 
went to Honduras to buy spare parts. We are clean. We did not 
plan any murder. I am incapable of becoming involved in such a 
plan," he has said, expressing his willingness to appear before 
police authorities to clarify the entire situation, because, he 
said "I am innocent." 
  Betancourt said he did in fact travel to Honduras with Luis 
Rene Quintero Gonzalez and Jose Arguello Hernandez at the 
beginning of March. They went to buy spare automotive parts. 
When they arrived in Honduras, he added, they were robbed at the 
San Miguel market in Comayaguela and "left penniless." They 
decided to go to the Nicaraguan Consulate. The ambassador gave 
them 100 lempiras so they could return to Nicaragua. He 
recalled they had requested a 90-day multiple entry permit. 
After the robbery, he said, "I had to ask an uncle, who lives in 
Honduras, for thirty lempiras to complete the return fare and 
then travel back to Nicaragua alone." 
  He admitted meeting Luis Rene Quintero Gonzalez, the alleged 
informant, by pure chance. He met Jose Arguello Hernandez, 
another alleged plotter, when they were cell mates serving time 
at Esteli Penitentiary. Santiago Rivas Betancourt said he was 
arrested last year for insulting a law officer. Unofficially it 
is reported, however, he served time for illegal possession of 
weapons and drugs. He also said he was a former member of the 
Sandinist People's Army, where he served as a battalion chief in 
the Army's 5th Infantry Company, in the country's first region. 
Betancourt lost his left hand in a mine explosion, just before 
being discharged. This happened in 1990, when he switched to 
civilian life. 
  Unofficial reports state Luis Rene Quintero Gonzalez, the 
alleged informant of the "plot," has an automotive body shop 
near Bello Horizonte Rotonda. None of the mechanics working in 
that area was able to give any information about Quintero. They 
did say, however, the police had been there at 1830 looking for 
the body shop and its alleged owner. A reliable government 
source has confirmed to BARRICADA the police were on Quintero 
Gonzalez' trail. They had not yet arrested him when we went to 
press. Unofficial reports state Quintero lived in the 
neighborhood of Fundeci, Managua. It was impossible to contact 
him there either.
