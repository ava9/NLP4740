<F P=106> [Report by Raul Gutierrez from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Gabriel Silva, Colombian ambassador to Washington, 
has told U.S. Senator John Kerry that Colombia is not a 
narcodemocracy and that our economy is not controlled by drug 
traffickers. In a letter, Silva refutes the statements made by 
influential U.S. Senator John Kerry against the Colombian 
Government and legal system that were published in THE 
WASHINGTON POST. 
  The ambassador said: The Colombian Government has made 
enormous sacrifices to defend its democracy, so it is hasty to 
say that Colombia is a narcodemocracy. 
  Referring to the Cali Cartel's alleged control over some 
areas of the economy and media, Silva said organized crime tries 
to infiltrate certain areas, just as it does in the United 
States, but the government and legitimate businessmen in those 
sectors do not tolerate it. 
  Another part of the letter stated: The abolition of 
extradition is a sovereign decision made by the Constituent 
Assembly, elected by the people. 
  In conclusion, the ambassador admited that the government 
has 
and will continue to have differences with the prosecutor 
general, but he emphasized that government branches cooperate 
and are independent.
