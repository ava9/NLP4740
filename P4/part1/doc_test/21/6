  [Text] In a news conference that was called following the 
publication of a news article in EL TIEMPO yesterday, Cuban 
Ambassador Jesus Martinez Beaton said that "it is not true that 
the Simon Bolivar National Guerrilla Coordinating Board 
participated in a guerrilla summit in Havana" or that the Cuban 
Government has set up an office for the Colombian guerrillas in 
the Cuban capital. 
  The diplomat repeatedly said that reports on the alleged 
office are "pure fantasy, speculation." He confirmed that the 
summit mentioned by EL TIEMPO was the Fourth Latin American and 
Caribbean Meeting of Solidarity, Sovereignty, 
Self-Determination, and the Life of Our Peoples, which was 
convened by the government and which was held in Havana between 
2 and 28 January 1994. 
  He said 25 Colombian delegates attended the event, of which 
previous editions were held in Quito (Ecuador), Santa Fe de 
Bogota, and Sao Paulo (Brazil). Some of them were: Guillermo 
Munoz from the AD/M-19 [19 April Movement Democratic Alliance]; 
Beatriz Zuloaga from Patriotic Union; Jaime Cedano and Miguel 
Gonzalez from the Communist Party of Colombia; and Manuel 
Rodriguez Garcia, labor union leaders from Telecom [Colombian 
Telecommunications Enterprise]. 
  According to the list released by Ambassador Martinez 
Beaton, 
others who attended the event were: Alberto Rivera, Alejandro 
Motato, Ana Maria de Villate, Antonio Jose Villate, Antonio 
Morro, Fidel Castro, Francisco Carbajal, Isabel de Guevara, 
Jairo Guerrero, Jorge Ortega, Luis A. Garcia, Luis Eduardo 
Vargas, Luz Ramirez, Nohora Espinal, Oscar Garcia, Rafael 
Espinosa, Rafael Ivan Forero, Fierbo (sic) Tulio Casas, Teddy 
Reyes, and Victor Manuel Bautista. The diplomat said all of them 
are persons linked to labor unions as well as social and peasant 
organizations that operate in Colombia. 
  "It is totally false that it was a meeting of guerrilla 
representatives; this is an event that is not secret and that is 
why our embassy processed the visas normally," he said. He said 
Cuba is not currently involved with Colombian guerrilla groups 
because "we have honest and sincere plans to achieve maximum 
relations with Colombia, and it is not our policy to interfere 
in the domestic affairs of other countries." 
  Ambassador Martinez said these persons arranged their trip 
through travel agencies, but admitted not knowing if there is a 
Colombian bishop among those mentioned on the list because "we 
do not investigate each person." He said he does not believe 
persons other than the ones mentioned on the list traveled to 
Cuba without the Cuban Embassy's knowledge because his 
government has very strict security and control measures to 
determine who participated in the event. The diplomat insisted 
that "no meeting by Colombian guerrilla representatives was held 
in Havana; there was no church participation nor any attempt to 
discuss the internal situation of Colombia in the framework of 
the event or outside the event." 
  Finally he pointed out that his immediate reaction to the 
report was due to the fact that "we have excellent relations 
with the Colombian Government and what appears to us is that 
there may be attempts to spoil this harmonious relation."
