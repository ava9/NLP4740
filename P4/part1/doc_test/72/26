RESTAURANTS CALL FOR SMOKING BAN IN PUBLIC PLACES

In what it says is a significant change of heart and not a change in tactics, 
the California Restaurant Assn. declared Tuesday that it would support an 
outright, statewide smoking ban in restaurants -- but only if smoking is also 
banned in all other public places. 
</P>
<P>
The organization, representing owners of about 10,000 restaurants, said its 
decision is largely an acknowledgment of new data on the risks of secondhand 
smoke. Such a legislative ban could leapfrog local smoking regulations, like 
those in place in San Diego and many other California cities, as well as Los 
Angeles Councilman Marvin Braude's proposal to ban restaurant smoking 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the smoking section of a downtown restaurant, 
association officials disclosed that they are drafting legislation that would 
enact the smoking ban. They said it would be "premature" to define a public 
place, although a representative in Sacramento said it would include such spots 
as bowling alleys, sports arenas and theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than point a finger to the workplace or to other environments where 
secondhand smoke far exceeds that in restaurants," said incoming association 
President Ted Burke, "the restaurant industry . . . encourages a total ban on 
smoking in each and every public place in California, without exception or 
exclusion." 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant association is one of the most influential lobbies in 
Sacramento, its members representing everything from food contractors to haute 
cuisine. It has battled smoking regulations at all levels, urging voluntary 
changes on its members, many of whom have found nonsmoking sections to be 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
The California-based Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights lauded the "breakthrough" 
turnabout in the position of the restaurant owners, but in the next breath said 
it was doomed by the cigarette industry's leverage in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased the restaurant association now recognizes that secondhand 
smoke is a public health problem," said Julia Carol, associate director of the 
anti-smoking group. She predicted that a total ban would not come about because 
the Legislature is "in the hip pocket" of tobacco interests. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, officials said they want the cities to beef up their 
current anti-smoking laws. But so far they say no city has matched the county's 
ordinance for unincorporated areas that requires at least 50 percent of the 
seating to be reserved for nonsmokers in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone else has vague language," said Jane Young, chief of public health 
education for San Diego County. Young said that she knows of no city ordinance 
in San Diego County that has designated a percentage of seats for nonsmokers in 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego requires restaurants that seat more than 20 people to set aside a 
sufficient number of nonsmoking seats to meet demand. Del Mar has a similar 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The county ordinance also bans smoking in all county buildings in 
unincorporated areas and says that employers must ban smoking in all shared 
work areas. The less stringent San Diego city ordinance says that smoking and 
nonsmoking workers must be separated. But with wording like this it means that 
smokers could be on one side of a room and nonsmokers on the other side, Young 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Jo Thompson, the restaurant association's senior director of government 
affairs and general counsel, said she has finished the first draft of the bill, 
which could not be introduced in the Legislature before January. Beyond 
prohibiting smoking in eating and drinking places, the proposal would ban 
smoking in "every public place, including bowling alleys, sports arenas, 
theaters," she said. It would not apply, for instance, to an employee cafeteria 
at a privately owned plant, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are fairly certain that our proposal is going to get a lot of pummeling. We 
have been pummeled before. We'll just have to take what comes," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the association is looking for a legislator who will carry the bill. 
It is certain to draw the attention of a large number of legislative combatants 
ranging from local governments to the tobacco lobby, health and medical 
interests, and restaurant and bar owners. 
</P>
<P>
Braude and the nonsmoking group are concerned that the legislation might pose a 
risk to smoking regulations already in place. One fear is that the legislation 
would be so sweeping in defining "public" that the Legislature would back away 
from it. Alternatively, they worry that any watered down compromise would 
impose less than rigorous standards statewide, possibly cutting off at the 
knees more stringent local measures. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation that would enact a smoking ban "is not going to hurt us at all," 
said Carol, of the anti-smoking group. "The only thing that would hurt us is a 
state law with preemption (of more rigorous local standards) in it, and we'd 
fight that tooth and nail, and it wouldn't pass." 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant association's executive vice president, Stan Kyker, dismissed 
local restrictions as "piecemeal" and confusing. "If secondhand smoke is a 
health hazard, then it is a health hazard for employees as well as customers, 
and it is a health hazard in all types of establishments in all parts of the 
states," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Association officials said the about-face, which came on a 90-0 vote at the 
June meeting of its board of directors, was not a direct response to Braude's 
May 29 proposal for a total restaurant smoking ban, the toughest in any major 
U.S. city. 
</P>
<P>
It is a reaction "only to the degree that Los Angeles becomes part of that 
patchwork quilt (of regulations) that is beginning to develop all over the 
state," said Kyker. "To say that it had absolutely nothing to do with it would 
be shortsighted, but to say that it is a response to it is also clearly too 
simplistic." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the country, local government agencies have sometimes been more 
vigorous in legislating matters from gun control to fireworks and smoking 
issues. In part, it is because lobbying money and special-interest leverage are 
often more effectively employed at the state level. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant association opposed piecemeal legislation as creating unfair 
competition between restaurants in neighboring cities. Kyker said it also would 
be against any state legislation banning smoking in restaurants alone, without 
including other public places. 
</P>
<P>
"Our board believes it is not a rights, moral or ethical issue," Thompson said. 
"It is simply a health issue. We feel beyond a reasonable doubt that secondhand 
smoke is a real health problem, especially for employees." 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, and up until this year, we have understood the smoking 
controversy to be a rights or moral issue that we felt we didn't have any 
business making any judgments about," she said. "Our board was not pro- or 
anti-smoking. They just wanted to accommodate those who wanted to eat at the 
restaurant or drink at the bar. They wanted people to be happy." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said the reversal also came in the wake of passage of the anti-toxics 
Proposition 65 in 1986, which, among other things, required the posting of 
signs where food is served warning of the hazards to health of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
"Our board looked at that and they felt this was the beginning of their 
acknowledgment that maybe there is something to the scientific studies that 
secondhand smoke is dangerous," she said.
