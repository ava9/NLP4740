The state Fair Political Practices Commission is investigating whether a 
prominent San Diego County businessman has violated state conflict-of-interest 
laws by voting to approve millions of dollars of construction projects as a 
member of the California Transportation Commission, sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
J. Thomas Hawthorne of Escondido, the exclusive dealer of Caterpillar heavy 
equipment in San Diego, pledged almost three years ago to abstain on 
Transportation Commission votes involving San Diego County after it was 
reported that the builders of almost every local highway project buy or rent 
equipment from his company. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hawthorne has voted for 52 area projects worth $164 million, 
according to a report prepared for the state Senate Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC probe could endanger Hawthorne's seat on the commission, to which he 
has been renominated for a second 4-year term by Gov. George Deukmejian. He is 
now chairman of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. President Pro Tem David Roberti (D-Los Angeles) said Wednesday that he 
will delay a scheduled Senate floor vote on Hawthorne's appointment while the 
FPPC reviews the matter. If the Senate does not act by Feb. 1, Hawthorne will 
lose his seat on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
A Senate source said the FPPC has asked the Transportation Commission for a 
list of construction contracts awarded on the 52 San Diego projects for which 
Hawthorne voted. FPPC investigators will then check with the contractors to 
determine how much of that business went to Hawthorne's firm, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Hawthorne nor the FPPC's spokeswoman could be reached for comment 
Wednesday.
