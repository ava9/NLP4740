COLLISION OF EMPIRES: BRITAIN INTHREE WORLD WARS 1793-1945
by AD  Harvey Hambledon Press Pounds 45, 784 pages
COLLISION of Empires is not one book but three. Its sections - on the wars
against revolutionary and Napoleonic France, and the First and the Second
World Wars - are separate works. They all just happen to be about long wars
since 1793 in which Britain was involved.
The book lacks two of the characteristics necessary for a contemporary
historical bestseller: copious illustrations and a price under Pounds 25.
But it has the rest. It is very long, very readable, very detailed, crammed
with footnotes evidencing colossal research; and it purports to address a
'big question': how did Britain's experience of the three wars compare?
Mr Harvey barely begins to answer that question, but his lucidity and
erudition are not to be gainsaid. As an account of the inter-connections
between politics, diplomacy and military strategy in three European wars
since 1793, his book is masterly, full of insight and sympathy. The minutiae
 -pages, for instance, on the origins of the Machine Gun Corps and why Sir
John French was not sacked earlier as commander of the British Expeditionary
Force - can be oppressive, but Harvey's grasp of constitutions, dynasties,
strategy, technology, national accounts, and more besides, is remarkable,
dazzling professional and bedtime readers alike.
Harvey has an eye for the vivid quotation and cutting aside. After a survey
of the chronic incompetence of pre-1914 Habsburg administration, he remarks,
'only an Austrian archduke could have fallen victim to a second
assassination attempt in one day.' Tannenberg, Ypres, Verdun, Caporetto, the
Somme, 'toll the passing of an age that was unprepared for its own demise
and died hard.' Stalingrad was 'only the nemesis of a consistently hubristic
style of campaigning.'
The hubris, and the insulation of military and political elites from the
horrors of all three wars, are deftly intertwined with passages on the
technicalities of tanks, gas, average earnings and high-definition radar.
'Generally,' Harvey opens one chapter, 'the military favoured new or
improved ways of killing people.' Like the fusilier who wrote back from the
trenches of the Somme, 'If hell is any worse I would not like to go to it';
or the First World War air squadrons in which the mention of casualties or
enquiries about colleagues missing at mealtimes were forbidden; or the
hundreds of German youths whose names are inscribed on gravestones in
Bergfriedhof, Heidelberg, 'the gazetteer of Nazi advance, retirement and
collapse.'
But when it comes to the 'big question', one looks in vain for an answer.
There is no systematic comparison of the three wars, even by way of
conclusion. Indeed, it is not clear why the war against revolutionary and
Napoleonic France is included at all. A three-page introduction says it is
on the grounds that 'in a sense, at least as regards Britain, it belongs to
the era of 20th-century warfare', while 'the assumptions behind the decision
for war in 1914 and 1939 will be more clearly understood if the earlier war
is taken into account.'
In a sense, yes; in many others, no. As for the assumptions, the evolution
of post-unification Germany, the Irish question, and the exigencies of
late-Victorian and Edwardian imperialism would add more clarity to the
decision for war in 1914 than pages on George III as a national symbol, or
paper roubles in circulation in the 1790s. For a book ostensibly about
empires, there is remarkably little about empire, either at the theoretical
level or by way of description of the imperial dimensions to the three
conflicts under examination.
Much of the book is not even loosely related to the theme of Britain in
three world wars. Calling them 'parallel cases' and suggesting that they
might give us a 'clearer idea' of British motivation does little to make
relevant lengthy sections on why Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and the US
did or did not declare war in 1914. Ditto the fascinating discussion of the
varieties of fascism, and of 'isolated ideologues' of similar ilk in Belgium
and France. 'Aspects of the three wars which tickle the author's fancy'
would be a more apt sub-title.
Only in the final paragraph is there a hint of an over-view, when Harvey
half-heartedly invokes a cycle from 'national wars fought without national
leadership, as in 1793-1815' to 'wars fought by national leaders determined
to survive in their bunkers while the nation as such perishes in the nuclear
holocaust outside.' But who was 'the nation' in 1793, and how was it able to
go to war for 22 years without its 'national leaders'? True, Harvey is
somewhat confused about the identity of the leaders. At one point William
Pitt is 'a royal servant surviving by royal favour'; later he is 'no royal
stooge' and only 'ostensibly' George III's servant. But whether George III,
Pitt or Wellington were at the helm, it would be intriguing to know how the
French wars are supposed to have been fought without them.
To be fair, Harvey gives a response to such carping in the concluding
sentence. 'We will know better,' he informs us, 'where we are going when we
have got there, and a book like this one cannot be more than an attempt at
an interim report.' If the interim report takes 756 pages, keep a retirement
or two free for the final solution.
