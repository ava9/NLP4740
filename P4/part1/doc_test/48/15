  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1615 GMT on 28 February carries a 30-minute 
documentary entitled "Being a Foreigner." This is the first 
installment of a three-part documentary series on Soviet 
intelligence agents working abroad. Part one is labelled "Line 
N." 
  The program begins with an interview with G. M. 
Nechiporenko, 
a former KGB colonel, who spoke about his 40-year career in 
intelligence work. He says that in the Soviet era, illegal 
intelligence activities were called "Line N," and the methods 
used were always the same, that all intelligence operatives 
carried out the tasks given to them by "the state machine." 
  The program next shows the shadowy figure of a man seen in 
profile, speaking in accented Russian about his career. A 
caption on his image says that former Soviet intelligence agents 
were filmed for this program. 
  The documentary next gives some historical background on 
Soviet intelligence operatives employed under Stalin, and gives 
the histories of several, including Rudolf Abel, who worked in 
the United States, a man with the pseudonym "Ben", who spied on 
the British nuclear submarine program, and "Sam" and "Julietta", 
a married couple working abroad. 
  Yuriy Drozdov, a major-general in the KGB and the former 
head 
of illegal intelligence, is interviewed next. He discusses the 
types of people who worked for him, and he says that one person 
was "even a foreign ambassador in another foreign state." Next 
there is a clip from an interview with George Blake, who is 
captioned as a "former agent for British, then Soviet 
intelligence." Later, there is a profile of Pavel Sudoplatov, 
who was the former head of the KGB's Fourth Directorate in 
charge of sabotage. 
  The next section of the documentary concerns the 
assassination of Trotskiy by the First Main Directorate of the 
NKVD, the former Soviet intelligence organization. This is 
followed by Colonel Nechiporenko talking about his work in 
Leipzig, and he claims that the KGB would use Leipzig as a ford 
for getting spies into the West, and that Germany was used as a 
training ground. This is followed by Abel, "Sam," and 
"Julietta" discussing their history and their methods of 
tradecraft. 
  At 1605 GMT on 9 March, Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian shows part two of the "Being a Foreigner" documentary 
series. This 30-minute part is called "Born in the Cemetery." 
  At the start of this program, KGB Colonel Gleb Nechiporenko 
speaks about the need to provide a spy with a complete false 
background identity including date of birth, place of birth, 
schooling, education, marriage, relatives, etc. This 
information is gleaned from old newspapers, library records, and 
gravestones. The narrator then goes on to mention briefly the 
false identities used by various Soviet illegals. Abel used the 
identity of the American Emile Goldfus; "Ben" used the identity 
of a Canadian Gordon Lonsdale; Peter Kroger obtained his 
identity in a New Zealand cemetery; "Sam" and "Julietta" changed 
their places of residence and birthplaces several times. Only 
the mysterious (?Ramzay), the code name for Richard Sorge, was 
born in the actual place where he claimed to be. 
  Next, there are brief interviews with Boris Gudz, a former 
counter-intelligence agent, Major-General Mikhail Ivanov, and 
KGB Maj.-Gen. Yuriy Popov who recall the case of the Soviet 
illegal Richard Sorge. Footage shown of decoded messages to the 
Red Army from Richard Sorge signed "Ramzay". Sorge had been 
trusted by the Germans despite the fact that he did not conceal 
that he was born in Baku and had worked for the Comintern. Nor 
was Sorge suspected by the Japanese, since he was working for 
their fascist ally. The operation involving Richard Sorge's 
work as an illegal had been carefully planned in advance, 
including the fact that his name had not been changed. 
  Brief screen interviews follow with Mikhail Fedorov, "Sam", 
and Galina Fedorova, "Julietta", who claim that their activity 
is not immoral. Next, Gleb Nechiporenko's younger brother, Oleg 
Nechiporenko, who is also an intelligence operative, is 
profiled. The narrator says that he was once regarded by the CIA 
as one of the best KGB operatives in South America. The 
narrator also says that shortly before the assassination of 
President Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald visited the Soviet Embassy 
and sought permission to leave Mexico for the USSR and that Oleg 
was one of the last diplomats to see Oswald. Historical 
information on Oswald is presented. 
  To conclude the second part of the series, several KGB 
officials discuss tradecraft, especially false documentation. 
  The third and final part of the documentary series "Being a 
Foreigner" is broadcast by Moscow Russian Television in Russian 
at 1615 GMT on 11 March. This 30-minute part is entitled "After 
the Legend." 
  To open, a pipe-smoking figure shown in profile says that 
simple things like the way one cooks are used to convince people 
that you are the nationality you claim to be as an illegal. He 
adds that it is a very rare thing for people to speak a foreign 
language without some kind of accent. Gleb Nechiporenko then is 
shown, and he displays various airport stamps used in forging 
documents. He shows examples of various airport stamps and a 
forged GDR passport visa. He is shown practicing the forgery of 
a signature. 
  Nechiporenko says the intelligence services were engaged in 
the aftermath of the 1956 events in Hungary. Throughout the 
world footage and photographs of those events by Western 
journalists were studied closely to bring culprits to book. 
Nechiporenko denies any idea that this was an improper task for 
intelligence services to be engaged on. 
  The documentary then returns to the subject of tradecraft. 
This includes brief interviews with the Fedorovs, "Sam" and 
"Julietta". It then shows that Gleb Nechiporenko served as a 
vice consul in London, where he was also worked in intelligence. 
His tasks could include purchasing several English hats, for 
instance, for use by illegals. Asked what kind of person he 
would want to send to Britain to work as an illegal, 
Nechiporenko said he would not send someone to pose as an 
Englishman. That would be too risky. He would send someone 
with excellent English but whose accent would not be suspect. 
For instance he could be a person with an American passport 
hailing from Latin America, for whom a slight accent would be 
natural. 
  Next, further historical background in given on the case of 
Rudolf Abel. Pavel Sudoplatov is shown in a cemetery viewing 
Rudolf Abel's gravestone, which also bears his other name 
"Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher". Evelina Fisher, Rudolf Abel's 
daughter, is briefly interviewed. 
  KGB Maj.-Gen. Yuriy Popov explains that illegals were 
dispatched to America during the fifties to be there in case 
there should be a war. KGB Maj.-Gen. Yuriy Drozdov, who was 
formerly the head of illegal intelligence, recalls how Abel was 
betrayed and arrested. Next, Western footage of various arrested 
Soviet illegals, including Klaus Fuchs, is shown. Evelina 
Fisher, Abel's daughter, says that her father considered a long 
absence when he was recalled to the Soviet Union in 1955 as one 
of the reasons for his downfall. He regarded a second return to 
America as dangerous in itself. Sudoplatov says that the mistake 
was that Abel returned to his studio for money. The 1962 
exchange of Abel for Gary Powers in Germany is then discussed. 
Drozdov recalls how the actual exchange took place. 
Afterwards, exchanges were handled differently, and footage 
shows the Krogers boarding an aircraft. One big difference with 
this exchange was in the publicity given in the West and East. 
The Krogers's departure was extensively covered in the West, but 
no photographers were around to cover their arrival in Moscow. 
Greville Wynne's arrival by air in the West was widely 
publicized, but the arrival of Lonsdale, or Molody,as he was 
also known, went unpublicized in Moscow. 
  The next part of the documentary deals with how the 
technology has changed, but the tasks remain the same. Gleb and 
Oleg Nechiporenko speak about hidden weapon caches. The 
narrator recalls the details of the Lonsdale spy case in which 
Houghton and others passed on top secret British naval data to 
"Ben", otherwise known as Lonsdale and Molody. KGB Colonel 
Yuriy Mostinskiy explains that after the return home of 
ex-illegals, attention is paid to their spiritual welfare and 
efforts are made to make use of the knowledge they have of the 
opponents' counterintelligence methods. The narrator says that 
very often these illegals pay a high price for being engaged in 
their work. Sorge was hanged, and others have undergone lengthy 
terms of imprisonment. The documentary concludes with the 
narrator saying that despite this, none of them have regretted 
their work as illegals.
