Members of the Kennedy clan were yesterday gathered at the bedside of Mrs
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who was apparently close to death as a result of
complications from cancer.
The 64-year-old widow of President John F Kennedy and of Mr Aristotle
Onassis, the Greek shipping magnate, was given the Catholic rites for the
dying at her home, after she had been told by doctors there was 'no more to
be done.'
Mrs Onassis had been receiving radiation and chemotherapy treatment all year
for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, normally a curable form of cancer. But she was
admitted to hospital on Monday with what were described as 'serious
complications' before discharging herself 48 hours later.
Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachussetts, who visited her on Wednesday
night, did not attempt to disguise the gravity of her condition. 'I think
all members of the family are distressed by the medical reports,' he said.
In the popular eye, Mrs Onassis is probably the closest the American
Republic has come to producing something like royalty. As Miss Jacqueline
Bouvier, she married the then Congressman John F Kennedy in 1953. They had
five children together, but three died shortly after birth.
When JFK became the 35th president, she brought to the White House a
youthful style and glitter not previously seen there, especially in her
emphasis on cultural activities. Her appeal was global, starting with a
sensationally popular visit to Paris in the summer of 1961.
The tragic nobility of her demeanour when her husband was assassinated in
Dallas in November 1963, while sitting next to her in the presidential
limousine, moved the country to tears and admiration. Great sympathy was
also extended with the assassination of her brother-in-law, Senator Robert F
Kennedy, in 1968.
Some of that lustre was lost when she married Mr Onassis later in the same
year and spent much time outside the US. But after his death in 1975, she
quietly re-entered public life, working for a New York publishing house and
shunning the limelight to the extent that she could.
