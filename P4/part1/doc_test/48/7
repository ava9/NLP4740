Celebrity attorney Melvin Belli says he went into law to help people, not to 
make money. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going into law to make money you're going to have a very miserable 
old age," Belli, who turns 83 on Sunday, said while in San Diego recently for a 
seminar. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you're going into it to help people, what a life it is. I can't think 
of anything more rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
Belli's clients have included Jack Ruby, who killed John F. Kennedy assassin 
Lee Harvey Oswald, and Jim and Tammy Bakker. 
</P>
<P>
Belli has written 62 books and dabbles in acting. He will soon appear in an 
episode of television's "Murder, She Wrote" and has made an ice cream 
commercial.
