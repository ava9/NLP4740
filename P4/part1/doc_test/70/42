Having lost four consecutive road games, the Detroit Pistons sought a return to 
their winning ways by concentrating on defense. 
</P>
<P>
Piston Coach Chuck Daly told his players if they held the Atlanta Hawks under 
100 points Thursday night, Detroit almost could be assured of getting back on 
track. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Aguirre came off the bench to score 25 points and Isiah Thomas hit four 
free throws in the final 31 seconds as the Pistons defeated the Hawks, 104-99, 
at Atlanta.

<P>
"Everybody knows the Pistons play tough," Aguirre said. "We played tough 
defensively down the stretch and we made some big shots." 
</P>
<P>
Spud Webb brought the Hawks to within 100-98 with a three-point shot with 12 
seconds left, but Bill Laimbeer made two free throws one second later to help 
secure the victory.

Dominique Wilkins led the Hawks with 17 points.

Chicago 111, Orlando 104 -- Michael Jordan scored 16 of his game-high 38 points

season.

<P>
Otis Smith pulled the Magic to within 104-102 on a 17-foot jump shot with 1:27 
left, but a basket by Jordan and free throw by Horace Grant clinched the 
victory for the Bulls, who have won five games in a row and 12 of their last 
14.

Smith scored a team-high 21 points for the Magic.
