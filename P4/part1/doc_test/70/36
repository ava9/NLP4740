Joe Dumars scored 29 points and Isiah Thomas added 20 as the Detroit Pistons 
defeated the New York Knicks, 117-106, Saturday night at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Pistons' fifth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Dumars, who scored 10 points in the fourth quarter, had five points during a 
15-5 run that put away the Knicks. Dumars also made 13 of 13 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing scored 29 points for the Knicks. He scored 20 points in the first 
half, but appeared to tire in the fourth quarter when he scored only three. 
</P>
<P>
The win lifted the Pistons to within percentage points of the Chicago Bulls for 
first place in the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
"We got great support from a lot of people," Detroit Coach Chuck Daly said. 
"Any time you beat New York, you do a lot of things well offensively and 
defensively. We needed the win." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Detroit's ninth in 10 games and gave the Pistons a 22-11 
record. That's the same record they had after 33 games last season, when they 
posted the best record in the league and won their first NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks had won 10 of their last 11 and four consecutive on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"We got our tails kicked," Knick Coach Stu Jackson said. "They played well and 
we played well in spots. Down at the end, their defense was better than ours. 
They're a very physical team." 
</P>
<P>
Utah 123, Denver 120 -- Karl Malone capped a 48-point performance with a 
three-point play with eight seconds left in overtime to lead the Jazz at 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Malone made a layup off John Stockton's 15th assist and was fouled by Eddie 
Hughes. Malone added the free throw, giving Utah a 123-120 lead, and Todd 
Lichti missed a desperation three-point shot for Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 120-115, Denver tied the score on two free throws by Lichti and a 
three-point basket by Hughes with 1:02 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Davis scored 36 points and Fat Lever added 19 for Denver. It was the 
Nuggets' second loss in 14 home games. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 118, Chicago 111 -- Jack Sikma scored 21 points and led a 
third-quarter surge to snap the Bucks' eight-game losing streak against Central 
Division rivals.

Alvin Robertson, Jeff Grayer and Ricky Pierce had 18 points apiece for the 
Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan led the Bulls with 35 points and Bill Cartwright added 18. 
Jordan twisted a knee with three minutes left in the first quarter. He iced it 
for four minutes, returned, and finished the first half with 13 points, 
although he was limping noticeably when he left the court at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte 117, Indiana 111 -- The Hornets, playing at home, beat a team with a 
winning record for the first time this season, leaving Pacers Coach Dick 
Versace to vent the frustration of four consecutive losses at referee Hank 
Armstrong at the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Versace had to be restrained by one of his players, LaSalle Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 109, Minnesota 96 -- David Robinson, Terry Cummings and Willie 
Anderson scored 22 points each as the Spurs, leaders of the Midwest Division, 
matched last season's victory total.

The Spurs are 21-7 with 3 1/2 months left in the season after finishing a 
franchise-worst 21-61 last season.

<P>
With the Spurs leading, 80-75, Robinson put the game away with nine consecutive 
points. He had 15 in the fourth quarter. The Timberwolves' Scott Roth led all 
scorers with 24 points and Tony Campbell added 20. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs led, 56-40, at halftime as Caldwell Jones contributed eight points 
and three blocked shots. The second one gave Jones 1,500 career blocked shots. 
Jones, 39, is the oldest player in the NBA. He finished with 11 points in 25 
minutes. 
</P>

Houston 124, Philadelphia 119 -- Akeem Olajuwon had 29 points and 15 rebounds

Floyd added 19 and a career-high 19 assists for the Rockets.

rebounds, hitting 12 of 12 from the free-throw line, to hand the visiting Nets 
their fifth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
John Long, playing his first game for the Hawks after signing a 10-day 
contract, hit a layup to start the winning rally with 11:24 to play, and 
Alexander Volkov converted a three-point play to put the Hawks in front for 
good.

Seattle won for the second time in three games with guard Avery Johnson in the 
lineup. Johnson, replacing Nate McMillan, had 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 124, Sacramento 121 -- The visiting Trail Blazers, using Terry 
Porter's 25 points, spoiled Dick Motta's debut as the Kings' coach. 
</P>
<P>
Two three-point baskets by Vinny Del Negro in the final eight seconds weren't 
enough for the Kings to overtake the Trail Blazers. Wayman Tisdale scored 30 
points, and Danny Ainge and Kenny Smith each added 23 for the Kings.
