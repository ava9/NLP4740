In a congested corner of the visitors' locker room in Phoenix on Sunday, 
somewhat ignored by other celebrants of the Lakers' Western Conference finals 
sweep of the Suns, Coach Pat Riley grabbed Magic Johnson by the neck and 
planted a kiss that landed somewhere near his collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, however, has vowed not to be so affectionate when the Lakers, 11-0 in 
the playoffs, resume working out this week while awaiting their opponent in the 
National Basketball Assn. championship series. 
</P>
<P>
Fearful that the Lakers will lose something with a layoff that will extend 
until at least next Tuesday, Riley said he has planned long practices, possibly 
a simulated game and, if necessary, a trip to Santa Barbara later in the week 
for what Riley called a mini-training camp. 
</P>
<P>
Some reward for sweeping three playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going to wish they got beat (in Game 4)," Riley quipped after 
Sunday's victory over the Suns. "They will wish that they extended this series 
longer to avoid what I've got planned." 
</P>
<P>
Riley does not want a week's inactivity to erode the Lakers' intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"Workouts have to be as intense as ever," Riley said. "We can learn from 
Detroit. They went into (the Eastern Conference finals) after a long layoff, 
and (Coach Chuck) Daly said they weren't as strong in that first game." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, however, are adept at playing the waiting game. They endured 
extended breaks after both the Portland and Seattle series, but this will be 
their longest layoff of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
And the Lakers aren't looking forward to it. 
</P>
<P>
Said Michael Cooper: "It will be pure hell." 
</P>
<P>
Said Mychal Thompson: "You know Riley's already rubbing his hands devising 
tortures for us. I tell you, it's like punishment for winning in four." 
</P>
<P>
And from Johnson: "We're going to go into hibernation and (Riley) will work us 
twice a day to get us ready. But you know me, I want to play tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
For now, the Lakers are merely interested observers in the Chicago-Detroit 
series. 
</P>
<P>
However, should they play the Bulls in the finals, they would have the 
home-court advantage because they finished the regular season with a better 
record than Chicago. If the Pistons were to advance for a rematch in the 
finals, the Lakers would have to make two trips to Detroit under the 2-3-2 
format. 
</P>
<P>
Said Riley: "I would say only that I would prefer Chicago because it gives us 
the home-court advantage. It's not as if we feel we can beat them easier." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to compare the Pistons and Bulls, Riley said: "Detroit's got the defense 
and the matchups. They match up against us maybe better in key positions than 
anyone in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"Chicago has enthusiasm, a sense of destiny and Michael Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
When he accepted the NBA's most valuable player award in Los Angeles last week, 
Johnson talked with excitement about a possible meeting with Jordan in the 
finals. After Sunday's game, however, he hedged. After all, two of his closest 
friends, Isiah Thomas and Mark Aguirre, play for the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter who we play as long as we're there," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Thompson: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a basketball fan, and I'd like to see Michael Jordan play in the finals. I 
told Magic that, if (the Bulls) made it, we'd all go home and let him and 
Michael go one-on-one. Play to 21. Make it, take it. 
</P>
<P>
"But we still respect Detroit, and we'd like to see them in a rematch from last 
year, too." 
</P>
<P>
Either Byron Scott or James Worthy probably would have to guard Jordan, with 
relief off the bench from Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't going to think about it right now," Scott said. "I'm not surprised 
(by the Bulls) at all, not with Michael there. They are a very different team 
than they were in the season. But we just want to go home and relax a while." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers might be home, but Riley will make sure that they won't relax. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
James Worthy continued his strong playoff performance in the Phoenix series. 
Worthy led the Lakers in scoring in the four games with a 25-point average. In 
11 playoff games, Worthy has averaged 24.6 points and made 60.3% of his shots. 
. . . With his 35-point effort in Game 4, Byron Scott finished the Phoenix 
series with a 24.8 average. Scott made 57.8% of his shots against the Suns. . . 
. A.C. Green led the Lakers in rebounding with an 8.8 average, followed by 
Worthy (8.3). . . . 
</P>
<P>
All Magic Johnson did in the Western Conference finals was average 20.3 points, 
14.5 assists and 6.8 rebounds. . . . Johnson broke the playoff record for most 
assists (57) in a four-game series. The record of 51 was reached by Bob Cousy 
(against Minneapolis in 1959), Walt Frazier (against Baltimore in 1969) and 
Phoenix's Kevin Johnson (against Golden State in the Western Conference 
semifinals). . . . In case you're wondering, no NBA team has gone undefeated 
throughout the playoffs. The 1983 Philadelphia 76ers have the best playoff 
record at 12-1.

Photo, Seller's Market -- An estimated 7,000 showed up Monday at the Forum with 
hopes of purchasing tickets for the NBA finals involving the Lakers and either 
the Pistons or Bulls. Only 1,300 tickets were available after sales to 
season-ticket holders. Those who didn't get tickets at least got some sun. JOSE
