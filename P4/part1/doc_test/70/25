THIS TIME AROUND, THINGS AREN'T SAME FOR LAKERS AND PISTONS

<P>
No friendly Valentine's Day pecks on the cheek will be exchanged between Magic 
Johnson and Isiah Thomas at half court before the tipoff of tonight's 
Laker-Detroit Piston game at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Unless, of course, Johnson hobbles out there in street clothes to greet his 
close friend. 
</P>
<P>
But that will not be the only change when last season's National Basketball 
Assn. playoff finalists meet for the second, and last, time in the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
In a mild surprise, neither the Pistons nor Lakers have the league's best 
record. The Cleveland Cavaliers resume play after the All-Star break three 
games ahead of Detroit. The Lakers rank third overall and first in the Western 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Lakers and Pistons have had their share of problems this season, but 
so far have endured. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers suffered through an eight-game road losing streak in December and 
January, and are facing the prospect of being without Johnson, who has a torn 
left hamstring, for an indefinite period. The Pistons, meanwhile, lost six 
straight road games at one point, have only a 1-8 record against their top 
three Eastern Conference rivals and have been rumored for weeks to be seeking a 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Pistons' 31-13 record is three games ahead of last season's pace, 
Thomas said they still have not proven themselves to be a "great" team, such as 
the Boston Celtic and Laker championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't a championship level team right now," Thomas said. "We still need to 
improve as a basketball team. We can't become stagnant. We have very good 
individuals, but we need to play together and become a team. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we do that, we won't get to the level of Boston and L.A. They've proven 
that they have done it. We haven't proven anything yet. Part of it is 
expectations. We want to win an NBA championship and we're pressing the issue. 
We feel the pressure to have the home-court advantage." 
</P>
<P>
For the Pistons to finish the regular season with not only the league's best 
record but also make a return trip to the championship series, Thomas said 
changes must be made. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to have some inside scoring," Thomas said. "We're a great basketball 
team now when we're hitting the 'J' (jump shots). But our transition game is 
not what it seems. When we force teams to shoot only (44.8%), we should be fast 
breaking more. 
</P>
<P>
"And, in the half-court game, we're relying strictly on jump shots. When we 
make it, it's great. But, when we get in trouble, is when we don't." 
</P>
<P>
After last season, the Pistons' expectations have been heightened, which may be 
why Thomas and other Pistons are not satisfied despite a five-game winning 
streak and the NBA's second-best record. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Chuck Daly has been quoted as saying the Pistons desperately need a 
post-up player who can score inside to seriously contend for the title. 
</P>
<P>
There has been considerable speculation that the Pistons will trade forward 
Adrian Dantley for Dallas Mavericks forward Mark Aguirre. A Dallas newspaper 
recently reported that Daly and Dantley had an argument, though Daly denied it. 
Aguirre has been quoted as saying that Thomas is pushing for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Because he is Aguirre's close friend, Thomas has been caught in the middle of 
the trade rumors. Speaking to reporters during All-Star weekend at Houston, 
Thomas said he has had no involvement in the Dantley-Aguirre affair. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I expect anything to happen?" said Thomas, repeating a question. "No. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I want anything to happen?" he repeated again. "No. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we have everything it takes to win the NBA championship?" he repeated. "I 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Choosing his words carefully, Thomas said he is not sure such a trade would 
ensure that the Pistons would win the championship. He also said reports that 
he and Dantley do not get along are false. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark Aguirre is a friend of mine, so that (speculation) naturally happens," 
Thomas said. "Sometimes rumors are true and sometimes not. Even before Adrian 
Dantley came to the Pistons, people said we didn't get along -- and that was 
before I even knew him. We've seemed to get along pretty good so far." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said he would welcome a rematch against the Lakers in the championship 
series, simply because it would mean the Pistons had once again made it that 
far. 
</P>
<P>
But he does not place special emphasis on tonight's game. Nor does he think the 
Pistons' 102-99 victory over the Lakers in Detroit Nov. 26 will mean much in 
the whole scheme of things. 
</P>
<P>
"If we go to L.A. and beat them without Magic, I don't know what that tells 
us," Thomas said. "Because you can beat a team one or two or even three and 
four times in the regular season, but it doesn't matter in the playoffs. Timing 
is everything. When you get in a seven-game series with a team, that's when you 
know." 
</P>
<P>
Clipper guard Quintin Dailey's recent suspension for being overweight brings to 
mind the near-legendary Dailey story from a few years ago when he played for 
the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
Dailey was sitting on the far end of the Bulls' bench during a game when he 
motioned for a ballboy. Dailey then instructed the ballboy to ask reporter Mark 
Vancil, then of the Chicago Sun-Times, if he could borrow $10. Dailey then had 
the ballboy go to the concession stand and purchase a hot dog, popcorn and a 
soda, which Dailey ate during the game. 
</P>
<P>
Add weighty matters: Dailey isn't the only player not active because of excess 
weight. Miami Heat guard Pearl Washington has aggravated a groin strain twice 
this season, and team officials believe it is because Washington is overweight. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's injury has healed, but Coach Ron Rothstein said Washington will 
not be activated until he loses 10 pounds. Washington weighs 213. He is listed 
at 200 in the media guide. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very tender situation for him," Rothstein said. "Weight has always been 
a problem, and if he's going to do anything, he has to learn. What's the sense 
of putting him out on the floor with the extra weight so he can pull his groin 
again?" 
</P>
<P>
Statistic of the week: The Houston Rockets have a 10-0 record against the 
Charlotte Hornets, Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs. Against the rest of the 
league, however, the Rockets are 18-18. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Barkley was involved in another controversy on a Philadelphia radio 
talk show last week, but this time Barkley wasn't even a guest. 
</P>
<P>
A caller named Mary, a 76-year-old grandmother from Trenton, N.J., told the 
host that she does not like Barkley because he is "mean and arrogant," and she 
would not listen when the host tried to defend Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that Barkley was listening to the show, called the station and 
went on the air to ask Mary to call back. She did not. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley has since contacted the woman and invited her to a 76ers' game. He said 
he is paying for her limousine service to and from New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Most NBA players stay at home during the four-day All-Star break. But Charlotte 
Hornets forward Robert Reid planned a trip to Morocco to meet with King Hassan 
II. 
</P>
<P>
Reid, an ordained minister, traveled there in his capacity as president of the 
Global Youth Foundation. He was scheduled to meet with King Hassan to discuss 
plans for the Junior Olympic Games in Casablanca in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Houston Post recently polled NBA players (142 of 300 responded) on various 
best-and-worst items, and both the Lakers and the city of Los Angeles are well 
represented. A few of the categories: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michael Cooper was chosen by the players as the second-best defensive 
player, behind Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Magic Johnson was voted as the "opposing player you'd least like to see 
take the last shot," beating out Larry Bird and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pat Riley won in two categories, "best dressed coach," and "opposing coach 
you'd least like to see diagram the last play." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Los Angeles is clearly a player favorite. It won for "best city to visit in 
January," "best city to visit in April," "best night-life," "best restaurants" 
and "best dressed fans." 
</P>
<P>
However, the players polled selected Boston as the city with the most 
knowledgeable basketball fans. Los Angeles finished third.
