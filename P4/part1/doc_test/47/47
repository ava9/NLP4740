Attention Vice President and National Space Council Chairman Dan Quayle: If 
you're looking for something important and innovative that the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration could actually do -- during your lifetime, 
perhaps even in this Administration -- here it is. How about a space 
environmental-study initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Recent news that U.S. Tiros-N weather satellites did not detect any 
global-warming trend from 1979 to 1988 raises a question: Why isn't science in 
space being used to answer questions that are driving everybody crazy on the 
ground? 
</P>
<P>
Environmental unknowns are a central topic of U.S political debate -- up to the 
White House, where top Bush Administration figures have been sparring over how 
serious the prospects for global warming are. Many in Congress are calling for 
major policy commitments as preemptive measures against environmental 
emergencies that may or may not be happening. International organizations are 
already issuing greenhouse-effect manifestoes. So where is NASA? 
</P>
<P>
NASA's current budget request bulges with capital for a continuously manned 
space station, an expensive -- $30 billion-$60 billion -- project whose returns 
to the public even its supporters have difficulty explaining. Millions more are 
allocated to the study of fantastically exorbitant -- perhaps $400 billion -- 
bases on the moon and expeditions to Mars, which both the President and vice 
president have rhapsodized about, because they sound incredibly nifty in 
non-binding speeches. 
</P>
<P>
Grand human ambitions such as a Mars flight will surely be realized someday. 
But today, in the Year of our Lord 0005 GR (fifth annum post-Gramm-Rudman), 
wasting breath on such notions may charitably be described as wacky. Meanwhile, 
there's comparatively little in the NASA budget for pragmatic environmental 
space missions that not only might provide information benefits for the 
taxpayers who foot NASA's bill, but also should be relatively cheap. 
</P>
<P>
Presenting its annual money request to Congress last month, NASA rolled the 
drums for what it called a new environmental focus. This "focus" turns out to 
be repackaging projects in the pipeline for years -- lately under the name 
Mission to Planet Earth. Funds involved represent less than one-third of the 
probable cost of the initial overnight stay in NASA's beloved orbiting motel, 
the space station. Several projects, such as a pair of improved 
Earth-observation satellites, are great ideas. But amazingly, though NASA is 
hyping its environmental focus as a "crash" effort, some of the spacecraft 
involved won't go up for 15 years. NASA went from exploding rocket prototypes 
to a moon landing in far less time. 
</P>
<P>
From an environmental standpoint, NASA science missions usually point in the 
wrong direction. Most are oriented toward the outer planets and the far heavens 
-- fascinating, but with no meaningful effect on the Earth. The sun, source of 
all Earth life, has received surprisingly little investigation; the same for 
Venus, the most Earth-like planet in our solar system and, more to the point, a 
planet with a runaway greenhouse atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most influential global warming document in the Bush White House 
has been a paper, written principally by the astronomer and "Star Wars" 
advocate Robert Jastrow, arguing that by the sun's sheer power, tiny 
vacillations in solar output are more likely to be the root cause of earthly 
climate variations than human mischief such as carbon-dioxide emissions. 
Jastrow contends that although the pattern of global temperature ups and downs 
in this century does not sync with greenhouse theory -- the thermostat has 
bounced around instead of rising smoothly -- it does appear to correspond with 
what's known about fluctuations in the sun's luminosity. 
</P>
<P>
But scientists understand amazingly little about the internal processes of the 
sun: Accurate information about its energy output is notoriously scarce, 
because such data is best collected in space. Sound like a promising field of 
inquiry? Yet NASA continues to devote more funds to studying other stars than 
our own. 
</P>
<P>
This October the shuttle Discovery is scheduled to launch Ulysses, an 
international robot spacecraft that will examine the sun's polar regions, 
unobservable from Earth. Ulysses is the first probe of the sun in more than a 
decade. Next year the shuttle Columbia is scheduled to carry aloft an automated 
solar study station called Atlas, which will be brought back down and taken up 
throughout the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
These are sound ideas, but fall short. NASA should be designing a major series 
of probes and satellites to ring the sun on a continuing basis -- not during 
brief shuttle trips as with Atlas. Such an initiative might not only help 
answer some of the pressing ecological questions: It could provide an early 
warning system for any changes in the fusion generator that sustains earthly 
existence. What if the sun cooled? We'd need to know that. 
</P>
<P>
Next consider Venus, whose size and composition are Earth-like, but whose 
900-degree surface temperatures are believed to result from a runaway 
greenhouse effect. NASA has a billion-dollar orbital research station in 
transit to Venus, for compiling radar maps of the topography of this 
carbon-clouded world. Such diagrams are likely to be interesting to astronomy 
graduate students and worthless from a practical standpoint. Yet the United 
States has no plans to fire probes into the Venusian atmosphere to find out 
what went wrong there -- knowledge that might bear directly on the terrestrial 
greenhouse debate. 
</P>
<P>
NASA, of course, isn't oblivious to the potential for reorienting temporarily 
toward environmental studies of immediate benefit to Earthlings. But in recent 
years budgetary circling of wagons has become the agency's claim to fame. Since 
Challenger, NASA management has exhibited absolute bureaucratic terror about 
offending any interest group, manufacturer or congressman's district by 
altering any plan once made. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, space environmental research would be carried out by boring, 
affordable automated spacecraft rather than marvelous budget-boosting manned 
chariots. A decade of inconclusive study of Mars flight is probably worth more 
to NASA's empire than a program to produce environmental information quickly. 
</P>
<P>
At minimum, the Mission to Earth projects should take precedence over 
feasibility studies about growing hydroponic oranges on Mars. Crash efforts 
focusing on the sun and Venus should be initiated. Everyone complains that NASA 
lacks a mission relevant to the man on the street. Here's one.
