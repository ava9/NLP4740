Apollo 11 astronaut Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin Jr. led a parade through the Johnson 
Space Center in Houston, the city whose name was the first word ever spoken on 
the moon two decades ago. "On July 20, 1969, men first stepped on the moon and 
made more than footprints in history," Aldrin told space fans at a rally beside 
what would have been Apollo 18, the giant Saturn 5 rocket whose mission was 
scuttled because of the costs of the war in Vietnam. Aldrin, minus his fellow 
moon walker of 20 years ago, Neil A. Armstrong, was one of 14 Apollo astronauts 
who attended the events commemorating the successful 1969 mission and other 
past accomplishments and looking ahead to an expanded program of space 
exploration. When the Apollo 11 crew first landed on the moon, Armstrong had 
said: "Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed."
