Now that we have him, can we give him a fair trial? That's the question that 
lawyers around the country are asking on the heels of Manuel Noriega's dramatic 
surrender to American authorities. 
</P>
<P>
There are no easy answers, because there is really no precedent for a jury 
trial of a deposed dictator charged with drug crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Never before in American history has a jury of 12 ordinary Americans been asked 
to sit in judgment on a major foreign policy goal of a President. Brave 
soldiers died in order to bring Noriega to justice. Can we really expect jurors 
to decide that these soldiers died in vain if they conclude that Noriega is 
probably guilty but there is a reasonable doubt? 
</P>
<P>
In previous situations where American foreign policy has demanded the 
conviction of deposed tyrants -- for example, at the post-World War II war 
criminal tribunals -- the cases were submitted to judges or to courts-martial, 
rather than jurors. The same was true of the trial of the murderers of 
President Abraham Lincoln at the close of the Civil War. It is expecting far 
too much from ordinary jurors to insist that they maintain a presumption of 
innocence when the President has put the prestige of our nation behind the 
claim that Noriega is a common criminal. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega has the option of waiving a jury trial and asking for a judge, but he 
has the constitutional right to demand a jury trial that is fair. The Noriega 
case poses a challenging test for the American judicial system. Juries work 
best in small cases involving obscure defendants. They do not work well in 
highly publicized cases involving notorious defendants. And they are at their 
worst when their patriotism is pitted against the rights of the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Judges, who are given the protection of life tenure, are supposed to assure the 
independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers. The federal judge 
who presides over the Noriega case will have more than the fate of Manuel 
Noriega in his hands. The integrity of the American system of justice will be 
on trial in that Florida courtroom.
