WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When George and Barbara Bush set out from the Capitol in their new $600,000 
armored limousine for today's inaugural march, they'll travel a 
much-transformed Pennsylvania Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
As they near the parade's end and turn toward the White House, they'll view the 
crown jewel of the avenue's $1.5-billion renovation, the Willard Hotel, the 
once vacant Beaux-Arts hotel that was restored to its original opulence and 
reopened in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel and a host of other buildings and parks are among the major new 
sights that have swept Pennsylvania Avenue since 1961, when President John F. 
Kennedy rode the boulevard for his inaugural and saw a historic street so 
battered, filthy and dreary that he demanded that it be rebuilt to an image 
befitting America's Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
It has taken almost 30 years, more than $1.5 billion and the efforts of a 
public agency working with private developers to fulfill Kennedy's demand. 
</P>
<P>
But now, gone are the shuttered shops, saloons and cheap hotels. New parks and 
lights, as well as restorations of historic buildings, have given Pennsylvania 
Avenue a clean, expensive look on the inaugural parade route. When the Bushes 
set out today on that path, stretching from the Capitol to the White House, to 
their right will be the newly completed Meade Plaza, featuring the relocated 
18-foot marble monument to Civil War Maj. Gen. George Gordon Meade. 
</P>
<P>
To their left will be the dramatic, angular East Building of the National 
Gallery of Art, designed by architect I. M. Pei. 
</P>
<P>
The parade will continue past the Andrew Mellon Memorial Fountain, whose 
54-foot wide bronze basin is the largest ever cast in the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cages of Canaries 
</P>
<P>
The Bushes will zip by John Marshall Park, one of five new park plazas 
completed since the last parade. The park connects the avenue to Judiciary 
Square, where cages of yellow canaries lined the walls of Ulysses S. Grant's 
1873 inaugural ball. 
</P>
<P>
Next to Marshall Park's stair-stepped garden and fountains is the gleaming, new 
Postmodern Canadian Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Moving up past 6th Street, the Bushes will ride past two elaborately 
refurbished office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Next they will see Washington's most laughed-at monument. The Temperance 
Fountain, featuring entwined dolphins beneath a water crane, symbolizes the 
superiority of water over demon rum. It was donated to Washington by San 
Francisco dentist Henry Cogswell in the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
Moving along, the Bushes will pass the Federal Trade Commission and another new 
park, Market Square Park Navy Memorial. The park features a 100-foot-wide disk 
inlaid with a map of the world, fountains and a 7-foot statue titled, "Lone 
Sailor." Military bands give concerts there in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Houses U.S. Constitution 
</P>
<P>
Across the street, on the south side, will be the sprawling National Archives, 
designed by John Russell Pope, architect of the Jefferson Memorial. Built in 
the 1930s, its 75-foot-high exhibit hall houses the U.S. Constitution, the 
Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
As much as those documents are a part of American history, Pennsylvania Avenue 
has been a key, colorful byway of the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
City planner Pierre L'Enfant -- hired by George Washington to plot a capital in 
the 10 square miles ceded from Virginia and Maryland -- envisioned Pennsylvania 
Avenue as a sparkling boulevard of foreign embassies with unobstructed, 
breath-taking views between the Capitol at one end and the White House, 14 
blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
But the avenue evolved differently. During the Civil War, a section of 
Pennsylvania Avenue at 14th Street became the city's red-light district. The 
man selected to care for this area was Gen. Joseph Hooker, who distinguished 
himself to such an extent that ladies of the night became known as hookers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commissions Appointed 
</P>
<P>
By the 1930s, the shops and boarding houses began to make way for a wall of 
Neoclassical office buildings. In the 1960s, the avenue was a hodgepodge of 
drab office buildings and run-down stores. 
</P>
<P>
Presidents Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon appointed a series 
of commissions to address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
But a turning point did not come until 1972, when Congress established the 
Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corp. to supervise the refurbishing of the 
avenue in tandem with the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the agency's major plans have come to fruition since the last inaugural 
parade in 1981. (Ronald Reagan's 1985 parade was canceled because of bitter 
cold weather.) Many feel the street has never looked better. 
</P>
<P>
But amid the beauty of the boulevard, there is also a lingering sadness. On a 
normal day, the homeless roam up and down the street. One man has set up a 
permanent residence of sorts, a configuration of plastic and cardboard, right 
in front of the Old Executive Office Building, next door to the White House. 
His scrawled sign proclaims him to be a war veteran. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homeless to Be Removed 
</P>
<P>
On parade day, the homeless will be removed from the avenue, though police have 
refused to discuss their plans for how this will be done. 
</P>
<P>
The Bushes, on the inaugural march, will pass between the J. Edgar Hoover FBI 
Building on their right and the Department of Justice on their left. The chunky 
FBI Building may not be pretty but it's one of Washington's most intriguing 
tourist attractions, especially the display of the "10 Most Wanted" criminals 
list. 
</P>
<P>
To spruce up the sprawling FBI building's Pennsylvania Avenue facade, the 
development agency is installing panels with eight life-sized figures of George 
Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, Abraham 
Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Another new office development, 1001 Pennsylvania Ave., will pop into view 
next. The 785,000-square foot facility includes a central atrium and 
incorporates a number of old architectural facades. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saved from Wrecking Ball 
</P>
<P>
On the left is a building that dominates this area of the avenue, the 
Romanesque-style Old Post Office Building, whose soaring observation tower 
brought it the nickname "Old Tooth" and made it the tallest building in 
Washington. Preservation groups had to fight to save it from the wrecking ball 
before an enormous restoration effort turned the building into a shopping 
gallery and 10-story office complex. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street from the Old Post Office is the Evening Star Building, built 
in Washington's Beaux-Arts style to house the afternoon newspaper. Its finely 
detailed white marble facade is being spruced up as part of a rehabilitation 
project that eventually will contain 212,000 square feet of office and retail 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Another new office complex appears next, across from the massive Federal 
Triangle office building complex. The Bushes then pass yet another park, 
renamed Freedom Plaza in 1988 in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. A block 
long, Freedom Plaza is one of the major public spaces on the avenue and is the 
first of three parks spanning the next three blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Just beyond Freedom Plaza, the Bushes can see a brand-new shopping, hotel and 
office complex, and the restored National Theater. Washington's oldest theater, 
it first opened in 1835 and reopened in 1984 after a major face lift. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Held Meetings 
</P>
<P>
The next block contains Pershing Park and just beyond it, the dazzling, 
renovated Willard Hotel and Office Building. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln held occasional staff meetings in the Willard lobby. Franklin Pierce, 
Calvin Coolidge and Harry S. Truman all stayed in the hotel, where King wrote 
his "I Have a Dream" speech and where guest Julia Ward Howe wrote the words to 
the "Battle Hymn of the Republic" on hotel stationery. 
</P>
<P>
Howe might have written another battle hymn if she could have looked into a 
crystal ball and seen the coming of the 1989 inaugural prices. The Presidential 
Suite, which has been rented out this week and includes a separate dining room, 
a grand piano, four-poster king size bed and a spa, goes for $2,300 a night. 
</P>
<P>
The parade route then makes a right turn where Pennsylvania is rerouted to jut 
around the White House, passing the giant Treasury Building and Garfinckel's 
Department Store before taking a left back onto Pennsylvania Avenue, now in 
front of the White House grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street will be Lafayette Square, a large park that has become the 
parking spot for protest groups a lunch spot for office workers and home to 
many homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The parade ends just past the White House, and the Bushes then can move into 
their new home.
