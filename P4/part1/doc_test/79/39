About 200 people watched as veterans and state leaders laid 20 wreaths Monday 
at Abraham Lincoln's tomb in an annual pilgrimage to mark the 181st anniversary 
of his birth. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) and Rep. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) presented a wreath 
from President Bush made of red, white and blue carnations. Both compared 
Lincoln's desire for freedom to the democratic movements in Eastern Europe and 
the release from prison of black activist Nelson R. Mandela in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln owned his only home in Springfield and lived in that downtown residence 
from 1844-60 while he practiced law and served in the Illinois General 
Assembly.
