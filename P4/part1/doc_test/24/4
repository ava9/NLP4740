The San Diego Select Team player selection committee has extended invitations 
to 20 area high school basketball players as San Diego prepares to play host to 
the AAU/Soviet 1989 Junior Boys' Basketball Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen local players will be picked for the May 13 game against the Soviet 
Union. Camp begins Monday at Torrey Pines High School, and the cuts probably 
will be made by the end of the week. Kearny's Bill Peterson will coach the 
team, assisted by John Farrell of Torrey Pines, Dennis Kane of San Diego High 
and David Ybarra of Sweetwater. 
</P>
<P>
The 20 who received invitations: Brooks Barnhard (Escondido), David Berteaux 
(La Jolla), Carlos Campbell (Sweetwater), Tony Clark (Valhalla), Darren Cox 
(Torrey Pines), Kevin Flanagan (Torrey Pines), Terrence Hamilton (Patrick 
Henry), Clark James (San Diego), Chris Johnson (Crawford), Adam Jones (Poway), 
Shane Knight (Poway), Ray McDavid (Clairemont), Joe McNaull (Monte Vista), Eric 
Meek (San Pasqual), Courtie Miller (Torrey Pines), Milton Miller (San Diego), 
Todd Swanson (El Camino), Will Tate (Southwest), Joe Temple (Lincoln) and Aaron 
Wilhite (Lincoln). 
</P>
<P>
The game will likely be either at Mira Mesa High School or Serra; it was hoped 
it would be in the San Diego Sports Arena, but a conflict with the Sockers has 
made the building unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's representatives for the Griggs Cup -- the high school division of 
the Ojai Tennis Tournament -- have been announced. 
</P>
<P>
In singles, the section will be represented by Marco Zuniga (St. Augustine), 
Jeff Miyamoto (Patrick Henry), Mike Miringoff (San Dieguito), Paul Dyson (La 
Jolla), Gene Carswell (Mt. Carmel), Tim Clark (San Marcos), Francisco 
Santillian (Hilltop) and Sean Willette (Serra). 
</P>
<P>
Doubles teams are Mike Kestler-Chris Swortwood (Torrey Pines), Dan 
McKenzie-Jeff Bethard (La Jolla), Ignacio Martinez-Pablo Zaragoza (St. 
Augustine), Eric Tebbs-Jeff Young (San Pasqual), Bruce Timm-V. Gonzago (Mt. 
Carmel), Oliver Davidian-Kevin Berry (Poway), Gil Bolton-Chris Hickson 
(Bishop's) and Nathan Schaedler-John Wadleigh (Coronado).

The Griggs Cup will be contested April 27-29. 
</P>
<P>
Best line from the recruiting season comes from Aaron Wilhite of Lincoln, who 
signed a national letter of intent Monday to play basketball at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of stress, but we ate real good," Wilhite said of the 
recruiting trips. "I gained about 10 pounds. We had steaks, prime rib and 
lobster just about every day." 
</P>
<P>
Wilhite was the first county high school basketball player to sign with a 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division I school since the beginning of the 
spring signing period Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Add recruiting: Granite Hills point guard Mark Phillips, who was recruited 
locally by Christian Heritage College, has signed a national letter of intent 
to play at Cedarville (Ohio) College, an NAIA school. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, 5-feet-11, averaged 16.8 points a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
Last add recruiting: Beau Pack, an All-City Eastern League basketball player 
for Point Loma, has signed a letter of intent to play for Chapman College in 
Orange, his father said . 
</P>
<P>
Jim Pack said his son, a 6-5 forward, selected Division II Chapman because of 
its sports medicine program and the fact that Bob Boyd, former USC coach, has 
just taken over the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
Weber State, Irvine and Pacific were among other schools that expressed 
interest in Pack, Jim Pack said. 
</P>
<P>
