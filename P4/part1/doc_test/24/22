They had to raise more than $10,000 to make the trip. Once there, they had to 
deal with inclement weather, a new course and a 28-team field. 
</P>
<P>
But the Mt. Carmel girls exceeded their No. 9 national ranking by defeating No. 
3 Palos Verdes to win the Eastern States Championship race Saturday at the 18th 
annual Manhattan College Cross Country Invitational at Van Courtland Park in 
New York City. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Sundevils' first appearance at the invitational, which, with more 
than 8,000 runners, is the largest cross country race east of the Mississippi 
River. 
</P>
<P>
The day before the race, it rained three inches, but the Sundevils negotiated 
the soaked 2 1/2-mile course and finished with 100 points. Palos Verdes had 
114. 
</P>
<P>
Six Sundevils finished in top 30, led by sixth-place Susan Scott with a time of 
15:52. Other finishers were Rita Hermiz (19th), Jennifer Vergith (21th), 
Charaighn Foss (26th), Marcia Larson (28th) and Kathleen Carl (29th). 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge of going out there in a foreign environment with a different 
layout and in the rain is a real positive, rewarding thing," Mt. Carmel Coach 
Dennis McClanahan said. "The girls, how they ran, is probably one of the better 
days we've ever had. They dominated everything." 
</P>
<P>
McClanahan's request to enter two varsity teams was denied, so he had one team 
in the first of two junior varsity races and then entered the two remaining 
girls in the second race. Mt. Carmel won the first junior varsity race by 50 
points by placing all six runners in the top nine. The Sundevils' Sara Smith 
won in 17:24. In the other JV race, the two Sundevils entered placed first and 
fourth.

Ramona was picked by every Avocado League coach to win the league, but now it's 
struggling just to make the playoffs. After being shut out, 41-0, Friday by El 
Camino, the Bulldogs are 3-3 overall and 1-2 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona, which had 17 of 22 starters returning from a team that last year 
advanced to the 2-A semifinals, has lost two consecutive games since assistant 
coach Jack Campbell was suspended indefinitely for directing a practice drill 
that resulted in a player suffering a shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino coach Herb Meyer, one of many who jumped on the Ramona bandwagon 
before the season, offered his perspective on what has gone wrong with the 
Bulldogs: "I'm sure there's been some chaos over the coaching situation. 
Outsiders don't understand how much that can affect a program. Another one of 
the major problems is, it's hard to be as good as everybody expects you to be. 
When you read all those great things about you in the paper, it makes it real 
hard to get your kids to focus." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer also said Ramona's line, which averaged 250 pounds, might have been 
overrated.: "When you start getting gigantic size, it really cuts down on your 
mobility. We watched them against San Marcos. That kind of size in high school, 
unless that person is a tremendous individual, can be offset by quickness." 
</P>
<P>
There will be a plot within a plot when La Jolla (5-1) meets Kearny (5-1) at 7 
p.m. Friday at Mesa College in a football game many believe will determine the 
City Western League. That's because La Jolla running back E.J. Watson, the 
county leader in touchdowns with 17, and Kearny's Darnay Scott, who led the 
county with 13 touchdown receptions last season, will be on the same field. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, a receiver/kick returner whose explosive speed has produced 11 
touchdowns and attracted Division I college recruiters, met Watson two years 
ago after Scott moved from St. Louis to Clairemont. Scott, a senior, quickly 
grabbed the spotlight over his neighbor last year, compiling 903 receiving 
yards for a 20.1-yard average. Now this may be Watson's year. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait to play against him," Watson said of Scott. "It's going to be 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista's Markeith Ross rushed for three touchdowns against Torrey 
Pines on Friday, giving him 15 for the year and a San Diego Section-record 58 
for his career, eclipsing the previous record of 56 by Sweetwater's Terry 
Rodgers (1983-85). 
</P>
<P>
Ross was a slow starter this season. He didn't rush for a touchdown until the 
fourth game of the season, when he scored a Section-record seven times against 
Poway. 
</P>
<P>
Through six games, he has gained 1,079 yards, but 761 of those have come in the 
past three Palomar League games.
