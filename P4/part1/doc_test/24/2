</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Cavers had No. 1-ranked Sweetwater right where they wanted it 
midway through the second quarter. They had the lead (28-17), the momentum and 
appeared to be playing with a ton of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
So what happened? How did San Diego wind up down 10 points with five minutes 
left in the game and on the wrong end of a 64-54 final? 
</P>
<P>
"We got tentative and Sweetwater got some momentum," San Diego Coach Dennis 
Kane said. 
</P>
<P>
And? 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't execute our offense and we didn't rebound on the defensive end, he 
said." 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater Coach Dave Ybarra had another explanation for his team's victory, 
which earned the Red Devils their first Section final appearance since 1980, 
when they won the title. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew sooner or later John (Gilbert) was going to hit a three, or Joe 
(McDowell) would get a dunk, or Carlos (Campbell) would get going," Ybarra 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater (27-1) meets Mt. Carmel -- an easy, 67-46 victor over Patrick Henry 
-- Friday night (8:30) at Golden Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Ybarra apparently knew something because all three premonitions came true. 
Gilbert hit a three, Campbell hit a couple jumpers and McDowell hit a follow 
shot -- his dunk would come later. Just like that, it was a six-point San Diego 
lead (30-24) at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Two more Gilbert three-pointers to open the second half and two Melvin Rushing 
free throws tied the score at 32. But after San Diego took a 40-37 lead with 
2:40 remaining in the third quarter, Sweetwater really turned up the volume. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, San Diego went into hibernation, largely because its leading scorer 
Clark James picked up his fourth foul. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, Sweetwater went on a 6-0 run sparked by Campbell and McDowell. 
Campbell had a length of the court drive for a layup and McDowell had a steal 
and his dunk. 
</P>
<P>
From there, San Diego closed to one twice, but never took the lead again. the 
Cavers trailed 48-46 after three quarters and 56-46 after a eight unanswered 
points by the Red Devils. 
</P>
<P>
James, a 6-foot-5 forward came back in the game early in the fourth quarter, 
but began going one-on-one and forcing his shots. After scoring 23 points in 
the first three quarters, James missed his last five shots, all long jumpers, 
and was pulled with 1:40 left and San Diego trailing by 59-49. 
</P>
<P>
"We got completely out of our offense," Kane said. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't win with one person," McDowell said. "Our defense is too good for 
that." DAVE McKIBBEN
