Having guided Fillmore High to the Southern Section championship game six 
times, Tom Ecklund is the last word in finals among Ventura County baseball 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
But he has difficulty finding the words to describe the achievement of this 
year's Flashes, who meet Beaumont in the 1-A Division final Friday at 7:30 p.m. 
at Blair Field in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Ecklund speaks with the wide-eyed wonderment of a rookie coach sailing along on 
a dream season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in total amazement that we're back in the championship game," Ecklund 
said. "It's really hard to comprehend. It's hard to understand how this is 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
What's happening? 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore slid to second-place in the Tri-Valley League but has slipped past 
three playoff opponents, including Aquinas, 3-2, Tuesday at Moorpark College in 
a semifinal game. 
</P>
<P>
Who are these news Flashes? 
</P>
<P>
Are they the same Flashes who were decimated by graduation after winning the 
1-A title last season? 
</P>
<P>
The same Flashes whose best player was kicked off the team for disciplinary 
reasons? 
</P>
<P>
The same Flashes who start two sophomores? 
</P>
<P>
Ecklund is right. It is hard to believe. 
</P>
<P>
Hard to believe that Brad Edmonds, who won his 11th game against two losses by 
scattering 11 hits and walking zero in a complete-game effort against Aquinas, 
had never pitched before this season. 
</P>
<P>
Hard to believe that the team that lost Southern Section Player of the Year 
Willie Leighton, et. al., could be brashly bashing at the door of another 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"We played a lot of kids this year who hadn't played before on the varsity 
level and even the ones who had experience have played different positions," 
Ecklund said. 
</P>
<P>
The gang of unlikely heroes are in a position to become champions, which would 
be familiar for Ecklund. Since becoming coach in 1973, he has led Fillmore to 
the finals in 1975, '76, '77, '79 and '88, winning the title in every instance 
but 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The legacy of success obviously has rubbed off on the latest group. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the kids who played last year are around, encouraging these guys," 
Ecklund said. "They feel it. They really have done a good job. I'm super-proud 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids have an attitude that they want to win, they want to be the best." 
</P>
<P>
Such resolve was needed against Aquinas (17-7-1), which took a 2-0 lead in the 
first inning and shut out Fillmore until the fourth. The Flashes loaded the 
bases in the first with none out but did not score, then left on two more in 
the third. 
</P>
<P>
"We were overswinging, trying too hard," said Ecklund, whose team left 12 
runners on base. 
</P>
<P>
Although Fillmore scored once in the fourth when Robby Ybarra walked with the 
bases loaded, the Flashes again left three runners aboard. 
</P>
<P>
The persistence paid off, however, as Chad Van Winkle singled down the 
left-field line in the fifth to bring home Rory Maus and tie the score, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
The winning run scored an inning later on a rally that began with two out. 
Ybarra singled, Edmonds and Maus walked and Tony Cervantez -- after hitting a 
ball over the fence barely foul -- hit a grounder through shortstop to score 
Ybarra. 
</P>
<P>
Aquinas had a runner on second with two out in the seventh when Fillmore second 
baseman George Frias preserved the victory by going to his knees to stop a 
ground ball up the middle by Miguel McQueen and throwing him out by a half 
step. 
</P>
<P>
"These are kids who haven't quit," Ecklund said. "I told them before the game 
that there are a lot of champions in the world, but real champions are ones who 
play the entire game, from start to finish. 
</P>
<P>
"That sums up this game." 
</P>
<P>
Edmonds, who threw only 91 pitches against Aquinas, told the coach he would be 
ready on two days rest. Who can doubt him? Edmonds has pitched all three 
playoff games.
