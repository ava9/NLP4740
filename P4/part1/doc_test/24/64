THE REVELRY SURROUNDING THESE RIVALRIES HAS NO PEER

<P>
Every morning when he walks out the door, Dan Schaitel shudders. He can't get 
used to seeing his wife wear red. 
</P>
<P>
The fuss over clothing is simple. Schaitel is the cross-country coach at Poway 
High School. For nine years, the family has worn the forest green and gray of 
the Titans. Red has been off limits since Day 1 because it is one of the colors 
of Mt. Carmel High School, Poway's Palomar League nemesis in more sports than 
one. 
</P>
<P>
But now, it's almost a prerequisite that Janet Schaitel wear red to work. This 
year she became the athletic secretary at Mt. Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
Rival Mt. Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At the 1989 cross-country meet between the schools, about 300 people lined 
the Lake Poway course to watch the Sundevils and Titans. Three hundred at a 
cross-country meet is like having 10,000 at a football game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A few weeks ago during a workout, Schaitel's team was running through the 
streets of an affluent Poway neighborhood. One of his runners was bitten by a 
dog belonging to a Scott Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher is the principal at Mt. Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, this is one heck of a rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
Not all coaches at the two schools are as intense as Schaitel and Mt. Carmel's 
Dennis McClanahan -- who recommended Schaitel for the Poway job -- but most 
coaches won't face each other as many as 12 times during the year with state 
and sometimes national rankings at stake in cross-country and track and field. 
</P>
<P>
"When the two schools get together," Schaitel says, "things happen." 
</P>
<P>
And that's what rivalries are all about. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Territorial bragging rights. The schools usually represent neighboring 
communities; the athletes often know each other and, in many cases, have 
competed against each other previously. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Championships. Nothing gets the adrenaline flowing like a game with a 
league title or playoff spot at stake. Bragging rights are OK, but does a 
rivalry mean as much if you're playing for fourth place? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Excellence. The schools have competent, competitive programs regardless of 
the sport, and beating a rival is often a barometer of your program. And a true 
rivalry transcends football. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Attendance/community support. The rivalry acid test: Does a bigger crowd 
than usual show up to watch the girls' volleyball match? 
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly, Poway-Mt. Carmel is the best rivalry in the county," Schaitel 
said. "They're both very competitive schools and they're both at the top of 
what they do. Athletics is still a major item in the overall environment at the 
two high schools; I don't think that's true everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Schaitel was graduated from Hoover in 1965 knowing the Cardinals' rivalry with 
Crawford, and he taught at St. Augustine, where he witnessed annual showdowns 
between Saints and University. And he's seen Poway and Mt. Carmel combine to 
win 11 section titles in 20 sports in 1989-90, including eight by Poway. 
</P>
<P>
You can't find 10,000 fans at a Poway-Mt. Carmel football game -- or virtually 
any game between schools from neighboring communities these days. But if you 
absolutely had to fill a stadium, Morse-Lincoln would do the trick. That might 
be as close as you could get to 1947, when 27,000 packed Balboa Stadium to 
watch the downtown team, San Diego, face off against its uptown rival, Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
One of those in attendance was 7-year-old John Shacklett, who was watching his 
first high school football game. He eventually was graduated from Grossmont in 
1957 and became the sixth-winningest football coach in San Diego County history 
(142-64-6 since 1971) at Morse High. 
</P>
<P>
He knows what big crowds are like. 
</P>
<P>
"We've thought about having a St. Augustine-University and Morse-Lincoln 
doubleheader in (San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium)," Shacklett said. "We just 
don't have a big enough stadium (of our own) right now." 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 were turned away at Mesa College for last year's Morse-Lincoln 
game, which has attracted as many as 10,000 in years past. But as big as 
Morse-Lincoln is, Shacklett sees another game becoming the county's biggest. 
</P>
<P>
"The last three or four years," Shacklett said, "Point Loma-Morse has been kind 
of a happening." 
</P>
<P>
Happenings are what it's all about when it comes to big games and rivalries. 
You can't afford Charger tickets? Try Helix-Grossmont or Sweetwater-Chula 
Vista. How about Valhalla-Monte Vista in wrestling? 
</P>
<P>
Basketball's your bag? Again, Lincoln-Morse. Poway-Mt. Carmel. Definitely 
Oceanside-El Camino: It's cramped, it's humid and it's a wonder tickets aren't 
being scalped outside. This rivalry's so intense, even the gym walls sweat 
bricks. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1986 game, an Oceanside player named Junior Seau -- now a Charger 
linebacker -- became a part of local lore. 
</P>
<P>
Playing at El Camino for the Avocado League championship, the game was heated, 
tempers flared, and some fans tried to storm onto the floor -- but were headed 
off by security. El Camino game films showed Seau had elbowed one of the 
Wildcats in the back of the head on a play near the basket. 
</P>
<P>
A week later -- after principals and athletic directors at the two schools had 
reviewed the incident -- Seau apologized to the El Camino players, who later 
beat Oceanside in the section finals. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, Seau was named the league's player of the year over El Camino's 
Edmund Johnson, and the two teams met in the finals again. 
</P>
<P>
"Edmund questioned some things in the newspaper about Junior and our team, so I 
clipped them out and saved them," Oceanside Coach Don Montamble said. "When we 
went to the Sports Arena to play them in the finals, I took the clips and 
posted them on the board while the team was waiting outside. I came back out, 
told the team to go inside, and then I locked the door behind them. 
</P>
<P>
"I left them in there long enough read the article and really stew it over. 
When I finally went in, it was a very focused locker room." 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside beat El Camino, 53-51, even though Seau sat out much of the game 
after getting in early foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt about it, Oceanside-El Camino is the basketball rivalry," El 
Camino Coach Ray Johnson said. "The last 10 years it's been us or them for the 
league title, and then you throw in the six section titles in the last (nine) 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Montamble remembers the rivalry from his high school days. He was at Oceanside 
for three years, then had the choice of going to El Camino his senior season, 
1977. He took it. 
</P>
<P>
In that first season, Oceanside beat El Camino in the first round of league 
play, but Oceanside kept the Wildcats from the playoffs by sinking a basket 
with five seconds left in their second-round game. 
</P>
<P>
They've been at each other's throats ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Many rivalries today are borne out of schools splitting. Helix broke off from 
Grossmont, Mt. Carmel from Poway, Chula Vista from Sweetwater. But with more 
schools being built, some other rivalries have diminished. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook's rival is still Vista, but Vista considers fourth-year Rancho Buena 
Vista its primary foe. Santana and El Capitan have been rivals for years, but 
with Santee getting a second school -- West Hills -- Santana probably will 
develop a healthy distaste for the Wolf Pack. 
</P>
<P>
Quite simply, where Sweetwater and Chula Vista used to be the only teams in 
Chula Vista and National City, now there are five, including Bonita Vista, 
Castle Park and Hilltop. Subsequently, Sweetwater-Chula Vista has lost some 
intensity over the past four decades. 
</P>
<P>
"The more schools you get in North County (or anywhere else), the less rivalry 
you have," said Bob Burton, the activities director at Fallbrook for the past 
25 years. "There's less tradition." 
</P>
<P>
A $35 million bond issue on the November ballot could provide for a second high 
school in Fallbrook by 1994 or 1995. Despite all the tradition that Burton will 
recall with fondness, the Vista-Fallbrook rivalry probably will become just a 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
Most "bitter rivalries" in the East County already are memories. Since the 
Grossmont Conference split into 2-A and 3-A leagues, many games lost their 
meaning. 
</P>
<P>
"Since that split, the intense rivalry just isn't there," Mimi Test, assistant 
principal at 2-A Valhalla, said of her school's rivalry with 3-A Granite Hills. 
"The intensity of rivalries in the Grossmont District has been diluted somewhat 
because when they go head-to-head, it isn't anything that counts heavy toward a 
league championship." 
</P>
<P>
The oldest East County rivalry, Grossmont-Helix, whose 40-year rivalry includes 
the football teams playing for the annual possession of a musket, is a 2-A vs. 
3-A rivalry. So is El Capitan-Santana and El Cajon Valley-Granite Hills. The 
East County rivalries tend to differ by sport based on strength of program. 
That's why Valhalla gets up for Monte Vista in wrestling, Granite Hills in 
football and Helix in water polo. 
</P>
<P>
Granite Hills' traditional rival is El Cajon Valley, but Valhalla generates 
more excitement. Elsewhere, Point Loma-La Jolla stopped playing for The Shoe; 
the Pointer football team became more interested in Morse while the other 
sports began looking toward Mira Mesa. That's also why the annual Southwest-Mar 
Vista "Battle for the Bell," a 50-pound perpetual bronze bell, has lost some 
glamour; Southwest has beaten Mar Vista seven of the past eight years, six by 
shutout. Now Southwest gets excited when it hears the words "Chula Vista." 
</P>
<P>
Yet rivalries are treated much differently by students today. 
</P>
<P>
Mount Miguel football Coach Gary Cooper was a member of the Class of 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"I've noticed a change in intensity," Cooper said. "When I was back in high 
school, we used to try to upstage one another. I can remember one year Helix 
sent over a big board of mounted hot dogs that represented our players -- had 
them delivered during our pep assembly. We retaliated with a helicopter 
dropping Kleenexes on their campus because they were the Scotties. We got in 
trouble for it. 
</P>
<P>
"There used to be more campus visits -- in a good-natured way -- and you don't 
see that as much now." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego rivalries reached their peak before the population exploded. There 
were fewer schools, larger talent pools and community-wide support. And winning 
was important. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rick Smith, who has done extensive research on the San Diego high 
school scene and was a sports writer for The Tribune from 1960-72, history 
would indicate that Hoover's best football team was in 1954. That year, Hoover 
Principal Floyd Johnson told football coach Bob Kirchhoff that if the Cardinals 
didn't beat rival San Diego, changes were forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover entered the big game with a 7-0 record; San Diego was 6-1. John Adams, a 
230-pound fullback who ran the 100-yard dash in 9.9 seconds and would finish 
the year with 26 touchdowns, broke off a 65-yard run and was tackled at the 
one-yard line by Willie West. The Cavers held on downs and eventually scored a 
7-0 victory. The next day The Tribune showed a photo of San Diego defensive 
back Art Powell clearly interfering with Hoover receiver John Vanderline on one 
of the passes into the end zone during the failed series. 
</P>
<P>
And Kirchhoff? He was canned. 
</P>
<P>
Rivalries for some schools aren't rivalries for others. It seems everyone 
dislikes San Pasqual. Ramona and San Marcos consider San Pasqual their rival, 
but San Pasqual's rival is Escondido. But 2-A San Pasqual plays 3-A Orange Glen 
every year for the Bear Trophy, a carved wooden bear that goes to the winner of 
the football game between the schools on Bear Valley Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
There are other tangible spoils for some rivalries. In addition to a musket, a 
bear and a bronze bell, other traditional football rivalries provide the Golden 
Whip (El Capitan-Santana), the Golden Feather (El Cajon-Granite Hills) and a 
Claymore sword (Mount Miguel-Helix). Bullhorns go to the winner of the Mount 
Miguel-Monte Vista wrestling match. 
</P>
<P>
There are also traditional awards for some football winners, such as the Lonnie 
Fields, Jr./Ty Morrison Southeastern Bowl Trophy (Morse-Lincoln), the Kiwanis 
Cup (Poway-Mt. Carmel) and the Chamber of Commerce Intercity Trophy 
(Vista-Rancho Buena Vista). 
</P>
<P>
And the two Catholic schools, University and St. Augustine, play the Charity 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, charity. If only Scott Fisher's dog had shown some. Then again, it was 
Poway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
