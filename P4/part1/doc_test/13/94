Bing and Lou Russell shifted uncomfortably in their seats, growing ever more 
irate as the heckler, a few rows back, continued his relentless diatribe. The 
target was the first baseman for the visiting Peoria (Ill.) Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, number nine, hustle to your position," the man yelled in a thick Latino 
accent. "You're better than that, nine. Stay in the game." 
</P>
<P>
No. 9 happened to be Matt Franco, the Russells' grandson. Finally, they had 
heard enough. Lou turned to confront the loudmouth, then gasped in 
astonishment. It was her son, Kurt Russell, doing one of his better acting 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Russell, best known for his roles in such films as "Silkwood," "Escape From New 
York" and "The Best of Times," had only the best of intentions, however. He 
wanted to fire up Franco without revealing his identity. No one knew Kurt was 
at the game in Rockford, Ill., not even his parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard him for a while, and when the inning ended, I looked up and it was 
Kurt," Franco said. "He was dressed to conceal his identity. He's gotta go 
incognito." 
</P>
<P>
Franco, whose mother Jill is Kurt's sister, rapidly is establishing his own 
identity. A 6-foot-3 left-handed hitter from Westlake High, Franco is 
challenging for the Midwest League batting title. With 13 games to play, he is 
batting .290, 15 points behind league-leader Scott Cepicky of South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Franco has batted .382 the past month for the Chicago Cubs' Class-A affiliate 
after beginning the season in a horrendous slump. 
</P>
<P>
Like any 20-year-old from Southern California, Franco saw his spirits -- and 
batting average -- rise along with the temperature. 
</P>
<P>
"The first few weeks were ridiculous. Some nights it was 18 degrees with the 
wind-chill factor," Franco said. "Who can hit when your hands are numb?" 
</P>
<P>
Bedeviled: They have used pitches rather than pitchforks, but two former 
Arizona State Sun Devils have helped toss former Camarillo High right-hander 
Travis Willis from Peoria's starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs assigned Lance Dickson, their 1990 No. 1 draft choice out of Arizona 
State, to Peoria on July 4. After four starts, Dickson was promoted. He is now 
with the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing Dickson at Peoria was Troy Bradford, the team's third-round draft 
pick, also out of Arizona State. About the same time, Manager Greg Mahlberg 
decided to stick with a four-man rotation after using five starters much of the 
season. All of which left Willis in long relief. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, Willis seemed an odd choice for banishment to the bullpen. The 
former Cal standout was 8-9 with an earned-run average of 3.18 in 20 starts for 
the Chiefs (49-77), who are last in the Midwest League. With five complete 
games he still ranks among league leaders and he has walked only 39 in 154 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"My control worked against me," Willis said. "They told me I'm a guy they can 
count on to come in and throw strikes. I was a better candidate for the bullpen 
than somebody who can't find the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Willis has been hit hard in relief -- he is now 9-11 with a 3.49 ERA -- and 
Mahlberg might be having a change of heart. Willis got a start against Waterloo 
(Iowa) on Friday night and gave up one earned run, getting the win in the 
Chiefs' 5-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Holy Toledo: How Scott Muckey made his professional coaching debut at age 37 is 
basically a travel story. Certainly, it's circuitous. 
</P>
<P>
The manager of the Toledo (Ohio) Mud Hens, John Wockenfuss, was afraid to fly, 
so he was told to hit the road. The lone coach, Aurelio Rodriguez, had family 
problems in Mexico, so he took off south of the border, never to return. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Gamboa, the new Mud Hen manager, called Muckey, a longtime friend, July 18 
and asked if he had two months to spare. Muckey was on the next flight to 
Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me all of a few seconds to make the decision," said Muckey, who had 
planned to spend the summer in his usual manner -- coaching an American Legion 
team and helping out at baseball camps. 
</P>
<P>
Muckey, the Crespi High coach, has been at the high school or junior college 
levels since his playing career ended at Pepperdine in 1974. All of a sudden, 
he found himself pitching batting practice and coaching first base for the 
Detroit Tigers' triple-A International League affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
In Muckey's first game, Toledo played Oklahoma City, which coincidentally is 
managed by Steve Smith, a friend of Muckey's. "He was kind of surprised to see 
me," Muckey said. 
</P>
<P>
The rookie coach trotted out to the first-base coach's box. The first Toledo 
batter singled . . . and was promptly picked off. The next Toledo batter 
doubled . . . and was picked off. Two innings later, a Toledo batter singled . 
. . and was picked off. 
</P>
<P>
"Old Smitty's over there in the dugout laughing at me," Muckey recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Muckey has earned respect with his understated manner and knowledge of the 
game. Yet he is a mere chick among the Mud Hens in terms of professional 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I've made all the rookie mistakes. Just trying to keep track of the time 
schedule is hard enough," he said, chuckling. "I was running out there with my 
uniform on when we were supposed to be in batting practice tops." 
</P>
<P>
Another day he forgot his cap. "If they were serious about fining me, they 
could have slapped me for $150 for not being in the right place at the right 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The fans have been less forgiving. During a game in Richmond, Va., Muckey 
fielded a foul ball down the first-base line and tossed it to the ball boy. 
</P>
<P>
Oops. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd was all over me," he said. "I don't know why. But now when a ball 
comes near me, I watch it roll by." 
</P>
<P>
The season itself is flying by. Muckey is enjoying every minute, but after a 
month beating around the bush leagues, he paints a less-than-romantic picture: 
Sit around a hotel room until 3 or 4 p.m., head to the ballpark, try to wind 
down after midnight. The next day, ditto. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the pro life's for everyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably a lot of kids looking to be pro players are in for a little bit of a 
surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Muckey, not being much for night life, has used his time in the hotel room to 
prepare for his Crespi teaching duties -- school begins Sept. 3, one day after 
the Mud Hens' season ends. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm studying up on physiology," he said without enthusiasm. "That's what they 
have me teaching this year."
