"It's a beautiful day for baseball," everyone was expecting Ernie Banks to say. 
"Let's play two!" 
</P>
<P>
But Banks, the Chicago Cubs' Hall of Famer and irrepressible optimist, forgot 
to deliver his trademark line. "I made an error out there today," he admitted 
later, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
As George Steinbrenner, Pete Rose and even Roseanne Barr could tell you, bigger 
errors have been made. Maybe baseball fans are fretting about the national 
pastime, but on Tuesday, a beautiful day for baseball, Banks and three other 
home run heroes -- Hank Aaron, Willie Mays and Japan's Sadaharu Oh -- gathered 
at UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium to celebrate the glory of their game -- and 
the hopefully glorious days to come for the likes of 12-year-old Pius Mayunga 
of Zimbabwe, 13-year-old Tom Rudl of Austria, and 13-year-old Olga Sukhoreva of 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was the opening ceremonies of the World Children's Baseball Fair, 
a weeklong event that has brought together more than 200 children representing 
23 countries to the UCLA campus to promote fundamentals that range from bunting 
to sportsmanship. Confidently described as the "first annual," the baseball 
fair is the brainchild of Oh and some Japanese corporate leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"The World Children's Baseball Fair is about children," Oh said through an 
interpreter. "I started playing baseball in Japan when I was in second grade. 
My family was poor, but baseball gave me the opportunity to change my life as 
it did for Henry, Ernie and Willie." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is about opportunity, Oh said. He paid tribute to the late Jackie 
Robinson, the first black allowed to play in major league baseball. Robinson's 
widow, Racheal, participated in the opening ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
"His courage was an inspiration to Americans of all colors and creeds," Oh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
This was baseball, after all, so the ceremony commenced with the playing of the 
"Star Spangled Banner." The children, all dressed in their uniforms, obediently 
doffed their caps and then sat down and fidgeted as the adults talked on and on 
in languages that only some of them could understand. 
</P>
<P>
Banks, serving as master of ceremonies, introduced each of the aging superstars 
as "this next young man. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Aaron spoke of his respect for Oh, a friendship born of their status as 
respective home run kings of their nations. Aaron hit 755 in the U.S. major 
leagues; Oh hit 868 in Japan's majors. "Mr. Oh's vision of baseball as a means 
of international good will is one that I share," Aaron said. 
</P>
<P>
Mays talked of the emotion he felt seeing children of so many nations together. 
"I tell you, I get chills. . . . This isn't about baseball, this is about what 
you're made of." He compared Oh's "dream" to that of Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Racheal Robinson remembered how "our world was opened up" when she and Jackie 
were students at UCLA. She suggested that the world would now open up for the 
children at the baseball fair. 
</P>
<P>
"This world is hungry, really hungry, for peaceful solutions to conflict," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The strong international showing was a measure of both the increasing 
internationalism of baseball and the funding from sponsors such as Hitachi, 
Mizuno and American Airlines. The U.S. home-grown sport, big in Latin America 
and some Asian countries for decades, is now making inroads in Europe and 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The time came for Oh, Aaron, Mays and Banks to each throw out a ceremonial 
first pitch. Banks had arranged for Jackie Robinson's grandson, Jesse, to catch 
the first throw -- but a kid from Venezuela cut him off and made the play. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone laughed. Banks wound up again and Jesse caught the ceremonial second 
pitch -- proving it was a good day for two after all. 
</P>
<P>
Soon it was warm-up time for the players, and they seemed glad that the pomp 
and circumstance was over, and they could get down to the business of playing 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
Pius Mayunga, a hard-throwing pitcher, was one of five youngsters from Zimbabwe 
who made the trip. Their chaperon explained that a barnstorming Nigerian team 
brought baseball into the country two years ago, and the game is quickly 
gaining in popularity. The five young Zimbabweans said they had never heard of 
Aaron, Oh, Mays or Banks before Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In Austria, however, the game hasn't exactly caught fire, but Rudl, a rangy 
first baseman, is eager to learn while running track on the side. 
</P>
<P>
Olga Sukhoreva, a girl shortstop, is more experienced at softball. But her 
fellow Soviet, 14-year-old Nodari Sidamonidze, is gung-ho for the game after 
hitting three homers in his first season of play. 
</P>
<P>
Does he like the game? "Da," Sidamonidze said.
