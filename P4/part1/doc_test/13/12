<P>
On a traditional Wrigley Field night of wet ivy and stiff winds Tuesday, 
baseball's 61st All-Star game produced a new murderers' row. 
</P>
<P>
Their names are Bob Welch, Dave Stieb, Bret Saberhagen, Bobby Thigpen, Chuck 
Finley and Dennis Eckersley. They are American League pitchers who murdered the 
National League's best bats, giving up only two hits in leading the AL to a 2-0 
victory before 39,071. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fewest hits by one team in All-Star game history, and only the sixth 
shutout. 
</P>
<P>
In a game twice delayed by rain for a total of 1 hour 23 minutes, the biggest 
pause occurred in the National League offense. Only four batters reached base. 
At one point, 16 consecutive batters were retired. The NL struck out six times 
and hit only 10 balls out of the infield, including the two hits. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco's Will Clark blooped a two-out single up the middle against 
Oakland's Welch in the first inning, and Philadelphia's Lenny Dykstra hit a 
line-drive single off Oakland's Eckersley to lead off the ninth. In between, 
only walks to San Diego's Tony Gwynn and Pittsburgh's Barry Bonds marred the AL 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
The AL got only seven hits against an All-Star game record nine NL pitchers, 
but they needed only one, a two-run double by Texas' Julio Franco after a 1:08 
rain delay in the seventh inning. Franco was voted the game's most valuable 
player. 
</P>
<P>
"We are coming into the All-Star game with a little different attitude these 
days," said Kansas City's Saberhagen, who was the winning pitcher with two 
perfect innings. 
</P>
<P>
"We have all heard how the National League is a better league, so we are coming 
in here to win games. 
</P>
<P>
"And we have some good pitchers. Mike Boddicker isn't here, and Roger Clemens 
didn't even pitch. So we have even better than we showed tonight." 
</P>
<P>
This was the AL's third consecutive All-Star victory, and fourth in the last 
five games. Overall they still trail in the series, 37-23-1. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the rain and the 16-m.p.h. winds blowing in from Lake Michigan, the NL 
hitters came up with some All-Star excuses. 
</P>
<P>
"Hitting was difficult tonight not just because of the rain, but also because 
you don't know the pitchers and you see so many different guys coming in and 
out," said San Francisco's Clark, who followed his single with two groundouts. 
"I wish we could have had a few (innings) more." 
</P>
<P>
Said Giant teammate Kevin Mitchell: "I definitely think the pitchers had an 
advantage in the All-Star game. Not only are you facing a guy who you've never 
been before, but he knows that he's only going to have to be out there for an 
inning or two." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who went hitless in two at-bats, was struck out by AL starter Welch 
to end the first inning with Clark on first. The Chicago Cubs' Ryne Sandberg 
stranded pinch-runner Barry Larkin of Cincinnati on second base by grounding 
out to third against Toronto's Stieb in the third. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, Eckersley kept Dykstra on first base by retiring San Diego's 
Roberto Alomar on a fly ball to center, striking out San Francisco's Matt 
Williams looking and retiring Tim Wallach on a foul pop to first base. 
</P>
<P>
With such pitching, the AL needed only one productive inning, which lasted more 
than an hour because of the rain. 
</P>
<P>
With showers growing heavier, the AL seventh began with Cleveland's Sandy 
Alomar Jr. sliding across first base to beat out a grounder to shortstop 
against San Francisco relief pitcher and loser Jeff Brantley. The Angels' Lance 
Parrish then followed with a perfect hit-and-run ground single to right field. 
</P>
<P>
Brantley was preparing to face Franco when play finally was stopped. It was the 
game's second delay; the opening pitch was 15 minutes late because of the rain. 
This was only the fourth All-Star game to be affected by rain. 
</P>
<P>
During the seventh-inning break, Brantley developed a stiff shoulder and, upon 
resumption of play, he was replaced by Cincinnati's Rob Dibble. Franco fell 
behind 0-and-2 to the hard-throwing Dibble before hitting a fastball into the 
right-center-field gap for a double, scoring Alomar and Parrish, who stumbled 
down the third base line but still crossed the plate without sliding. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he was going to throw the fastball because he had been warming up for 
20 minutes, and I was stiff," Franco said. "I was looking at him warming up and 
saw that he had a lot of body motion. Everybody said he threw hard, so I just 
tried to get it to right field. " 
</P>
<P>
The inning ended with one of the game's few classic confrontations. It occurred 
after Franco took third on a grounder by the Chicago White Sox's Ozzie Guillen 
and Toronto's Kelly Gruber walked and stole second. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's Jose Canseco then hit a fly ball to right fielder Darryl Strawberry. 
As Strawberry caught the ball, Franco tagged third base and raced for home. 
Strawberry's throw to Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia reached him on a line and 
Scioscia, blocking the plate as always, tagged out Franco for the double play. 
</P>
<P>
Another NL hero was Dodger pitcher Ramon Martinez, who had an eventful third 
inning, which he completed by retiring Canseco on a grounder with runners on 
first and second. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez replaced starter Jack Armstrong of Cincinnati in the third. Armstrong 
gave up one hit in two innings, after becoming the first pitcher to start an 
All-Star game in his first full major league season since the Dodgers' Fernando 
Valenzuela in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the third and New York Yankee Steve Sax on second after a walk 
and a stolen base, Martinez struck out Oakland's Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped Boston's Wade Boggs, who was intentionally walked. Why? So Martinez 
could face Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Canseco is a home-run hitter, but I know Boggs has a better chance of 
driving in a run in that situation," National League Manager Roger Craig said. 
"I'm trying to win a game." 
</P>
<P>
His strategy worked as Canseco grounded out meekly to Sandberg.
