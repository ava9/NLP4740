</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Earl Jones took such larger-than-life steps on Broadway and in Los 
Angeles as Troy Maxson, the baseball player-turned-frustrated trash collector 
in August Wilson's "Fences," that anyone who saw him might well wonder whether 
any other actor could fill Maxson's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego premiere of "Fences" by Southeast Community Theatre at the Lyceum 
Space proves that this work does not need a star to remain a major vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
It won a Pulitzer Prize and the Tony Award not because of the immensely 
talented Jones -- who was indeed dazzling -- but because "Fences" is a terrific 
piece of work. 
</P>
<P>
Under the direction of Floyd Gaffney, the UC San Diego professor responsible 
for nearly every locally cast African American production in San Diego, a 
strong ensemble cast takes turns aiming at Wilson's rich text, and knocks the 
ball over the fence more than once. 
</P>
<P>
Part of what makes Wilson's work so compelling is that he uses fiction to tell 
the truth. Through Maxson, the play tells the story of the pain of one-time 
black ballplayers who never got the chance at major league baseball before 
1947, when Jackie Robinson broke the color line. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not just historical truth that Wilson is interested in, it's emotional 
truth. His Maxson is no hero; he's charming, funny and a great spinner of tall 
tales, but he is also a frustrated man who takes his frustrations out on his 
family. And one can understand why. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio (T. J.) Johnson puts depth beneath the swagger in the role of Maxson, a 
man who was thrown out of his father's house when he was 14. He ends up making 
his way in the world as best he can, marrying young, fathering a child, 
stealing -- and doing 15 years in prison for one of those robberies. 
</P>
<P>
He was sent to prison as a teen-ager, where he discovers he has a love and 
talent for baseball. But like the real-life black baseball slugger Josh Gibson, 
who may have been the model for the role, he is too old for the game by the 
time Robinson integrated the league in 1947. Gibson died in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
As the play begins in 1957, we find Maxson living out the rest of his life on 
the bench. Now 53, he keeps keeps going, but not without dying a little inside 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
He's collecting other people's trash in Pittsburgh after starting a second 
life. He is making a home with his wife of 18 years; his second son; his 
brother, Gabriel, who had part of his mind blown away in World War II, and a 
friend, Jim Bono. 
</P>
<P>
Is he angry? Sure. Does he support his second son, Cory, also a natural 
athlete, when he is recruited to play college football? Not a chance. Does his 
love for his wife help him resist the temptation of other women? Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
Maxson is a flawed human being, and yet Wilson's genius lies in making you care 
for the aches of this very complex and sometimes brutish man. 
</P>
<P>
He does this partly through Maxson's wife, Rose, eloquently played by Sylvia 
M'Lafi Thompson. Rose is the moral center through which we judge Maxson. Her 
anger is our anger, her pain at what he's done is our pain, and ultimately her 
love and forgiveness is the signal that it is time for us all to suspend 
judgment for a while. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever Maxson did or didn't manage to accomplish with his life, attention 
must be paid. 
</P>
<P>
Attention is also paid to the technical details in this tenderly mounted 
production. 
</P>
<P>
The set, by Ocie Robinson, is a wonderfully realistic depiction of a poor brick 
house, in front of which the ever-present bat and the ball suspended by a 
string speak volumes about where Maxson's heart still remains. David Coons' 
lighting captures the changing times of day. The costumes by Marian Laubert 
re-create the flavor of the period. The sound by Dirk Mahabir fills the mood 
with mournful to high-stepping strains. 
</P>
<P>
The roles of the sons prove most tentative here; it's as if the actors, like 
the sons themselves, have not quite settled on the best way to relate to this 
troublesome and troubling father. 
</P>
<P>
Shanga K. Parker brings strength and almost too much intelligence to Cory, the 
second son who locks horns with his father. The conflict would have come across 
more clearly had he been more pronouncedly like his father, and like his 
father, had less of a handle on what emotions were driving his life. 
</P>
<P>
Grandison M. Phelps III also stumbles a bit as the first-born son, Lyons; one 
expects him to be a bit more of a hip, street-smart talker, but his anxious 
desire for his father's attention does come across loud and clear. 
</P>
<P>
Damon Bryant provides backbone to the story as Maxson's best friend Jim Bono, 
who is looking to Maxson -- of all people -- for clues as to how to get through 
his own life as best he can. Joel Brisker brings a touch of the bright-eyed 
supernatural to the part of Gabriel, a crazy who may just have more of a 
pipeline to heaven than the others realize. 
</P>
<P>
This production is an extraordinary play that should put another feather in the 
cap of Southeast Community Theatre, which continues to play a unique and vital 
role in producing the masterpieces of African American theater in San Diego.
