<P>
To say Chris Cannizzaro Jr. grew up with baseball is like saying that Hank 
Williams Jr. grew up with music, or that Edsel and Henry Ford II grew up with 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 23, 1962, Christopher John Jr. was born the first son of New York Mets 
catcher Chris Cannizzaro Sr. He was the first newborn for a member of the 
National League expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
"On my birthday, until I was about 5, all the old Mets used to send me 
presents," Cannizzaro said. "I think my mother still has some of them." 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, Chris Jr. went on trips with his father, playing catch and 
taking batting practice in every National League park. 
</P>
<P>
On the Padres' first opening day in 1969, Cannizzaro, then 7, sat in San Diego 
Stadium with his mother, Beverley, and his younger sister, Kimberlee, and 
watched Chris Sr. catch the first game in Padre history. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, Chris Sr. is hoping to someday watch his son play major 
league baseball. But there remains a question about when, and even if, that is 
going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
After successful years at Patrick Henry High (where he was an all-section 
shortstop while leading the Patriots to the 1980 3-A championship) and San 
Diego State (where he was an All-American second baseman in 1982), Cannizzaro 
is in his seventh season in the Boston Red Sox minor league system. 
</P>
<P>
Having spent the past 3 1/2 years with triple-A Pawtucket, Cannizzaro is still 
waiting for that first major league swing. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're a kid," Cannizzaro said, "you don't really think about what you're 
going to do for a living. I never really expected to be in the big leagues. I 
just enjoyed playing the game. It was a way of identity for me. It was what I 
did. That's what I was associated with. I think baseball kept me clean and out 
of trouble, at least somewhat." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry Coach Bob Imlay said that because of Cannizzaro's early 
association with big leaguers, "He was the most polished, skill-wise and 
emotionally, kid I ever had. He told me his dad never pushed him, but he 
learned a lot just by watching and mimicking the big leaguers. He was led by 
example. 
</P>
<P>
"He never wasted any time on the field. He was always working on something. I 
remember him telling me once that Pete Rose was his idol. Because of his style 
of play, of course." 
</P>
<P>
Cannizzaro is 5-feet-8, 170 pounds, short and slightly stocky. His primary 
position is second base, although he can play any infield position and has been 
used in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
He is a switch hitter who uses the whole field from both sides of the plate. He 
hits for average, scores a lot of runs, makes things happen with his heads-up 
style and hits occasional home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Batting third for Pawtucket, which plays in the International League (known for 
low batting averages) Cannizzaro leads the team with a .270 average and 29 runs 
batted in. For whatever reason, and Cannizzaro could not explain it, he had no 
home runs in his first 200 at-bats this season after hitting eight last year. 
But in his next 38 at-bats, he hit five and had his first two-homer game as a 
professional last week. 
</P>
<P>
"He plays every game like it was his last," Chris Sr. said. "And that's the 
only way I ever taught him. I never pushed him into baseball. He always wanted 
to play. He always had enthusiasm. The only advice I gave him was to play hard. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I taught him the intricate parts of baseball, like where to play a 
certain batter and what to do with a three-and-one pitch, but Chris is his own 
person. He's done it being Chris Cannizzaro Jr. not because of Chris Cannizzaro 
Sr." 
</P>
<P>
At Patrick Henry, Cannizzaro hit in the low .400s and was awarded the team 
captain trophy after the season (Detroit Tiger catcher Matt Nokes was the most 
valuable player). Cannizzaro was not drafted and received no scholarship 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
He instead walked on at SDSU and made the varsity his freshman season. By his 
sophomore year, he had established himself as one of the best second basemen in 
the nation. He made the American Baseball Coaches Assn. All-America team after 
batting .348 with 101 hits (second best in Aztec history at the time), 48 RBIs, 
68 walks and 30 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
His junior year was considerably better, but he was left off the All-America 
team. He hit .363 (98 for 270) with four home runs, 60 RBIs, 83 walks and 39 
stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were the learning years," Cannizzaro said. "Coach (Jim) Dietz was a very 
dedicated coach. I learned a great deal from him." 
</P>
<P>
At SDSU, Cannizzaro played with future big leaguers Tony and Chris Gwynn, Bobby 
Meacham, Al Newman and Mark Williamson. The Aztecs were always in the top 20, 
reaching No. 1 for about a month during Cannizzaro's junior year. 
</P>
<P>
After his junior year in 1983, Cannizzaro was invited to play for the U.S. 
all-star team, which would become the 1984 Olympic team. But he also was 
drafted in the ninth round by the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the hardest decision I had to make up to that point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cannizzaro chose to forgo both his senior year and the Olympics and sign with 
Boston. That summer and the next, he played Class-A ball in Winter Haven, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he was promoted to double-A in New Britain, Conn. After one year, it 
was on to Pawtucket, where Cannizzaro has been for 3 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I never put any timetable on making it to the majors," he said. "But I thought 
because of how fast I got to triple-A, that I would be there by now." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "No question, it gets frustrating. But if you dwell on that, that 
you're one level away from your goal, you're going to hurt your performance on 
that level. Of course, I want to play in the big leagues, but more importantly 
I want to enjoy life. I want to be happy. And right now, playing baseball on 
any level is enjoyable. It makes me happy. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had an enjoyable minor league career. The only bad part is I've been 
bypassed by the big club three or four times." 
</P>
<P>
Once was about a month ago. On June 4, Boston's regular second baseman, Marty 
Barrett, suffered torn cartilage in his right knee and was placed on the 21-day 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
Cannizzaro, then hitting around .280, thought he surely would get the call. He 
felt he deserved to be called up. He had performed consistently well at the 
highest level of minor league baseball for four seasons. He was ready. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox opted for Pawtucket's shortstop, Luis Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
"When Marty Barrett went down, I thought, 'This is it.' But they bring up a 
shortstop who's hitting .250 and I'm hitting .280 at the time. I understand 
(management's)thinking. They had traded for (Rivera) last winter. He has a year 
of big league experience, and he was the last one cut from spring training." 
</P>
<P>
Cannizzaro made it to the second-to-last cut. 
</P>
<P>
So what happens? 
</P>
<P>
"He goes up there and tears it up," Cannizzaro said. "And I'm happy for him. 
But that tells me I could do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his lengthy stay in triple-A and his being passed over on a number of 
occasions, Cannizzaro is not bitter toward the Red Sox management. But neither 
is he happy. He has asked to be released or traded, but each time management 
has refused. 
</P>
<P>
After this season, his seventh in the minors, he will become a free agent. But 
he is uncertain of his future. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned that the only thing that is certain, is that nothing is certain," 
he said. "If I retire, having never made it, but knowing I was a good triple-A 
ballplayer, that's OK, I can live with that."
