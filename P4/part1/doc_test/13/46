Jason Friedman and Mitch Kaylor have become a duo with a flair for the dramatic 
in recent games for the Cypress College baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
The two players were at it again Friday when Cypress defeated Rancho Santiago, 
4-3, in 11 innings in a Southern California regional game at Rancho Santiago in 
front of about 350. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress, the home team, tied the score, 3-3, in the ninth inning on a 
bases-empty home run by Kaylor, his sixth. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers won it in the 11th when Kaylor scored from second on Friedman's 
two-out single up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
It was the same pair who led Cypress to its comeback victory two weeks ago 
against Fullerton. Cypress trailed, 4-1, going into the ninth, but Kaylor hit a 
two-run home run to tie it, 4-4. Friedman hit a two-run home run to win it, 
6-4, later in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"We're becoming a tandem," Friedman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Patterson (10-3) allowed eight hits in 11 innings for the victory. Losing 
pitcher Willie Navarrette (11-5) went the distance. 
</P>
<P>
John McTaggart had a sacrifice fly and Sean Ramos had an RBI single as Rancho 
Santiago scored two runs in the sixth to take a 3-2 lead. Cypress scored single 
runs in the first and fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Navarrette took the 3-2 lead into the ninth but fell behind Kaylor, three balls 
and a strike, to open the inning. Kaylor then lined the ball down the 
left-field line just above the fence. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a fastball and I was looking for it," Kaylor said. "I thought it might 
go off the fence or it could go out. I wasn't sure so I just put my head down 
and ran." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Gill followed with a single and Friedman lifted a fly ball deep to left 
field, but McTaggart caught it near the fence. Doug Yates popped out and Brett 
Gregory grounded out to end the ninth. Each team was retired in order in the 
10th. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago had runners on second and third with two outs in the 11th when 
Louie Maldonado hit into a force play to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Navarrette's downfall started when he walked Terry Tewell to open the 11th. 
Kaylor then tried to sacrifice, but Tewell was forced at second. Gill flied out 
to center. Kaylor moved to second on a passed ball while Friedman was batting. 
</P>
<P>
Navarrette fell behind Friedman, three balls and a strike, before throwing a 
called second strike. Friedman fouled off a ball then grounded the ball up the 
middle just past the glove of shortstop Tim Reynolds and Kaylor beat the throw 
to the plate to score the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I thought he might walk me," Friedman said about the final at-bat. 
"But after he came in with a good breaking ball to make the count full, I knew 
he was going to go after me." 
</P>
<P>
The hit for Friedman was his 79th of the season to break the single-season 
Cypress record. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress plays Los Angeles Harbor in the second round at 11 a.m. today at Rancho 
Santiago. L.A. Harbor defeated Palomar, 18-8, Friday. Rancho Santiago plays 
Palomar in the losers' bracket game at 10 a.m. at Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Burbank (12-4) will start for Cypress today. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson's performance was keyed by a decision to pitch inside, something he 
hadn't done in his two losses to Rancho Santiago this season. Patterson also 
hit four batters. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Rancho Santiago) always get in on the plate and I've tried to pitch 
away, and it really hasn't worked," Patterson said. "Today, I just had to 
establish the inside, and it worked."
