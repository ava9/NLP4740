Ryan McGuire admits the idea sounds hokey. In fact, he uses more descriptive 
terms, such as "dorky and corny." 
</P>
<P>
McGuire, a first baseman at El Camino Real High, took out a small ad in the 
school paper. Those purchasing the ads, called senior wills, were asked to 
bequeath to their classmates items of sentimental value. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire left an item or two to a couple of teammates but saved the best for 
last. 
</P>
<P>
"I willed the baseball team one night on our field of dreams," McGuire said. 
"Dodger Stadium. I tried to figure out something catchy, but it was the most 
eloquent thing I could think of." 
</P>
<P>
Here's to willpower. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real defeated San Fernando, 3-1, Friday in a City Section 4-A 
Division semifinal game before an estimated crowd of 1,000 at Valley College 
and, in doing so, advanced to the final Wednesday night -- at McGuire's venue 
of preference. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real (21-2-1), which last played in the championship game in 1984, 
will face Chatsworth in the final. Chatsworth defeated Taft, 6-1, in a 
semifinal game at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Treend's dreams had plenty to do with fields too. Such as being planted six 
feet under in one. 
</P>
<P>
The senior right-hander threw a one-hitter and struck out 11 in what he termed 
his "best game of the year," but he conceded that the butterflies have been 
bat-sized all week long. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the most scared guy on the team," he said. "I laid in bed every night 
since I knew it was going to be San Fernando and us. They scare me more than 
any team in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
McGuire's looping single in the first inning keyed a two-run rally that started 
San Fernando's downfall. Facing left-hander Canto Franco, a surprise starter, 
Jeff Marks walked and took second on a wild pitch. McGuire's excuse-me dunker 
to right gave El Camino Real runners at first and third with nobody out. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a sit-on-a-fastball-and-drive-it swing," McGuire said. "But it turned 
into a oh-my-gosh-it's-a-straight-change swing. I just dropped the bat on the 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
After Jason Cohen forced McGuire at second, with Marks holding at third, Bobby 
Kim gave the Conquistadores a 1-0 lead on a chopper through the hole into left. 
Greg Lederman drove in Cohen, who had stolen second and moved to third on Kim's 
single, on a ground out to short. 
</P>
<P>
Franco (9-1) surrendered a leadoff double to Lederman to open the fourth. 
Treend, who has been among the team leaders in runs batted in all season, then 
smacked a liner into left to give El Camino Real a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I still wouldn't call Pat a hitter," McGuire said, grinning. "He grabs a bat, 
walks up and starts swinging. He reduces the game to its basics." 
</P>
<P>
After Treend's single, Franco was relieved by senior right-hander John Najar, 
whom many expected to start. Figuring that El Camino Real would be among that 
group, the Tigers (18-7-2) threw the junior lefty instead. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured we could get three or four innings out of Canto and then come back 
with Johnny," San Fernando pitching coach Joe Bergara said. "He pitched good, 
but they get a walk, a check swing, a passed ball. . . . and boom, we're down 
two runs." 
</P>
<P>
Najar was impressive, allowing no runs or hits and striking out five over the 
final four innings. But the damage had been done, and Treend ensured the lead 
would not be blown by blowing fastball after fastball by the Tiger batters. 
</P>
<P>
The senior right-hander -- who completed his 12th game in 13 starts -- did not 
allow a ball to be hit out of the infield over the first four innings. Treend 
carried a no-hitter into the sixth, when San Fernando mounted its only real 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Sanchez led off the inning with a liner to left-center that center 
fielder Marks caught off his shoe tops on the dead run. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I caught it," Marks said. "My glove was on the ground when it hit it. 
The play before, Jason (Cohen, the left fielder) said to dive for anything." 
</P>
<P>
But Marks' acrobatics might have saved more than a mere no-hit bid. 
</P>
<P>
Treend walked David Rojas on four pitches and with two out, hit Najar on an 0-2 
pitch. Jess Ceniceros singled cleanly to left to drive in Rojas. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Ortega then launched what seemed destined to be a double into the gap 
in left. Marks, however, tracked the ball down to save two runs. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff saved my butt, big time," Treend said. 
</P>
<P>
The catch prompted an impromptu jig from El Camino Real Coach Mike Maio, who 
spent much of the game in a crouch or on both knees in front of the dugout, 
ripping up blades of grass. At times, he seemed too worried to watch the game, 
instead looking at the pebbles around his feet. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I saw it," said Maio, who led El Camino Real to the final in 1984, only to 
lose to Granada Hills. "I think it's better for the team if I just sit there 
and play with rocks or something." 
</P>
<P>
Treend walked Luis Rodriguez with one out in the seventh and San Fernando sent 
pinch-hitter Damacio Mendoza to the plate. Mendoza, a long-ball threat who was 
promoted from the junior varsity for the playoffs, waved at three Treend 
fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
Treend retired Sanchez on a grounder to second to end the game. The final out, 
of course, prompted the usual festive pile on the mound. Eloquent, it wasn't. 
But nobody seemed to mind.
