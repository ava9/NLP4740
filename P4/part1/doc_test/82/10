News item: "South Bend, Ind. -- Football Coach Lou Holtz today apologized to 
the University of Southern California's football team for a pregame brawl that 
erupted in the stadium tunnel before Saturday's USC-Notre Dame on the Irish's 
home field. 
</P>
<P>
"We take full responsibility for that thing occurring," the coach said in 
urging a written apology from his team. "We were completely out of line." 
</P>
<P>
 You can bet the Notre Dame coach is quick with an apology. 
</P>
<P>
It is, of course, easy to be magnanimous in victory. But, the issue goes deeper 
than that. 
</P>
<P>
You would never think it to look at them, their image in films and television 
and story books and the rich lore of collegiate football being what it is, but 
the Fighting Irish often skirt the thin line between ostracism and adulation. 
</P>
<P>
Their crime is evident: They win too much. 
</P>
<P>
If you think this sits well with their victims, you don't know college 
football. 
</P>
<P>
You see, you don't have to play Notre Dame. The Irish don't belong to your 
conference. They don't belong to any conference. You don't have to get through 
them to get to a bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
They are the bully boys of the Midwest. They annually have 80 or 90 of the best 
football players on the planet in their gold and blue (or, sometimes, Kelly 
green). They are the darlings of the subway alumni and the Cadillac Catholics 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Other sectors of the population are able to restrain their enthusiasm. In fact, 
the powers that be in the church have pretty much de-emphasized football at 
other major Catholic schools -- Fordham, the Loyolas, Holy Cross -- at least 
partly because their success tended to exacerbate anti-Catholic sentiment, 
polarize prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
It was all very well for Notre Dame to reign supreme when the Irish had Knute 
Rockne, the Four Horsemen, Hollywood films with Ronald Reagan playing the 
Gipper. They were part of the era of wonderful nonsense. Schoolboys hummed the 
fight song. Outlined against a blue-gray sky was the original America's team. 
</P>
<P>
Rockne was a publicly jovial showman and salesman, a canny old Norwegian who 
looked a little like Santa Claus and had an almost Churchillian wit and charm. 
It was darn near a pleasure to lose to Rockne. 
</P>
<P>
His successors were something else again. Fortunately, Hunk Anderson and Elmer 
Layden didn't win too much. Sometimes, not at all. 
</P>
<P>
But then along came Leahy -- and all the latent anti-Notre Dame sentiment 
surfaced. He gave it an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Leahy was no Rockne. He didn't charm anybody, he just beat them. Teams 
began dropping off the schedule like rats leaving a burning building. The 
storied Army series, the games that gave the country the legend of the Four 
Horsemen, the rivalry that filled Yankee Stadium and Soldier Field, was 
unceremoniously ended after 34 years. Michigan gave Notre Dame a wide berth. 
Woody Hayes at Ohio State wouldn't be caught dead -- or alive -- playing Notre 
Dame. 
</P>
<P>
There was a very real fear that Notre Dame would become the pariah of 
intercollegiate football. So they fired Leahy as a sop to those who contended 
that it was not the college that ticked them off but the coach. They even 
de-emphasized football, which was a mistake for Notre Dame. Their varsity began 
to look less like next year's Chicago Bears than this year's California Bears. 
</P>
<P>
I remember going to USC Coach Jeff Cravath in the critical period before Notre 
Dame dumped Leahy. The concern in South Bend was that they would lose Southern 
Cal, as the West Coast school was always identified in Hoosierland, and this 
would be a catastrophic public relations blow for the school that Rockne built. 
</P>
<P>
Cravath acknowledged that his colleagues were jumping off Notre Dame's schedule 
and trying to talk him into joining them. SC would not join the parade, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be the best if you don't play the best," Cravath told me. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't think Notre Dame was relieved, you underestimate the value they 
put on their Southern California connection, with its proximity to show 
business, sound stages, networks and swimming pool alumni. 
</P>
<P>
Ara Parseghian won just enough to keep the alumni happy -- and lost enough not 
to make the competition unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it's Lou Holtz's turn. He has Rockne's jokes -- but Leahy's teams. So, 
it's back to the tightrope. 
</P>
<P>
It's all very well to get in a pregame donnybrook with, say, the University of 
Miami. Notre Dame prizes the series but Miami's image, rightly or wrongly, is 
that of a bunch of thugs in pads. Harvard, it ain't. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California is something else again. Lou Holtz knows it. Notre Dame 
knows it. Ugly brawls between the two squads do not serve the image of the 
rivalry. Taunting does not serve Notre Dame's image. Too many people worked too 
many years to make the Irish-Trojan game what it has become, an American 
institution, to see it dissolved by a hoodlum rumble. 
</P>
<P>
An apology is a nice start. A cleanup of their act would be more to the point. 
Notre Dame has beaten up SC seven times in a row now. It would seem that the 
Irish could wait till the kickoff. Or, Holtz is afraid, they won't have SC to 
kick around anymore.
