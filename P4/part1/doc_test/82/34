HEISMAN RACE: WHAT SHOULD COUNT MOST?

Maybe the design of the Heisman Trophy should be forever altered. Instead of 
the now-famous, 25-pound, 13 1/2-inch, bronze statue of an old-time football 
hero, perhaps the award should be a glass-encased fax sheet with the winner's 
game-by-game statistics. 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of many, that is what college football's most prestigious 
individual prize has become. What is supposed to go to the best collegiate 
player in the country recently has gone, nearly without exception, to the guy 
who has put up the best offensive numbers. 
</P>
<P>
This year's race, which is still almost as wide-open as when the season began, 
has stirred an inordinate amount of debate. The merits of a player's stats vs. 
his worth to the team will be argued until, and possibly after, the voting is 
announced Dec. 2 at New York's Downtown Athletic Club. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the single-most controversial statement regarding the 1989 Heisman 
race was made this week by Syracuse Coach Dick MacPherson. 
</P>
<P>
Known for his bluntness in a profession filled with cliche-mongers, this time 
MacPherson went mouth first with both feet. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Indiana tailback Anthony Thompson's record-setting 377-yard rushing 
performance last week, MacPherson scoffed. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, he should be banned from the Heisman," MacPherson said. "That's a joke. 
To do that against Michigan, then you win the Heisman. Don't do it against 
Wisconsin and try to impress me." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who leads the nation's Division I-A players in rushing yardage per 
game (168.2) and points per game (16.4), is considered one of a handful of 
legitimate late-season candidates for the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
Others thought to be among the leading contenders, for various reasons, are 
three quarterbacks: Houston's Andre Ware (stats), West Virginia's Major Harris 
(one-man offense) and Notre Dame's Tony Rice (see eight other Fighting Irish 
winners). 
</P>
<P>
Asked this week if he thought he would win the Heisman, Harris said, "Not a 
chance. This is really a two-man race between that running back at Indiana and 
that quarterback at Houston. I'm not in in the race." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rice: "I'm not thinking about that. What I want is another (national 
championship) ring." 
</P>
<P>
From a strictly statistical standpoint, Ware and Thompson have moved to center 
stage. Ware has set nine National Collegiate Athletic Association records and, 
with 40 touchdown passes, is eight shy of breaking Jim McMahon's all-time, 
one-season mark. Thompson, who broke Rueben Mayes' record of 357 yards in a 
game, is also the National Collegiate Athletic Association's all-time touchdown 
leader (60). 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can ignore the numbers," Houston Coach Jack Pardee said of 
Ware. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some factors going against Ware and Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Houston is on probation and not on television, and Ware would be the first 
player in that type of situation to win the award. (Barry Sanders won it last 
year with very little television exposure, after which Oklahoma State went on 
probation.) 
</P>
<P>
Indiana is 5-4, and, against the top two rushing defenses in the Big Ten, 
Michigan and Michigan State, Thompson was held to 172 yards on 58 carries. His 
longest run from scrimmage this year is 35 yards, making him not the kind of 
game-buster you expect to see win the Heisman. 
</P>
<P>
In defending the way he used Thompson last week, during a 38-17 victory over 
Wisconsin, Indiana Coach Bill Mallory said, "You can't ask a kid to put more 
into his football. He trains and conditions himself to do that. You've got some 
guys who carry 52 times and you have to give them mouth-to-mouth." 
</P>
<P>
While Thompson and Ware continue their onslaught against the record books, 
Harris might have resuscitated his chances with back-to-back games of 300 yards 
or more total offense against Penn State and Rutgers. There is certainly some 
sentiment -- albeit from the East -- for Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Consider that Harris was the leading returning Heisman vote-getter from last 
year after the top four, including Sanders, went to the National Football 
League. Consider, too, that West Virginia lost its entire offensive line from 
last season, as well as two of its top receivers. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a vote for the Heisman, I'd go with Major because of the job he's 
done," MacPherson said of the player who has led the Mountaineers to a 7-2-1 
record, and could finish with more than 2,000 yards passing and close to 1,000 
yards rushing. "He has clearly done something special." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Luicci of The (Newark, N.J.) Star-Ledger, who does have a vote, will cast 
his for Harris. He said statistics alone shouldn't determine the Heisman. "If 
it was just stats, let the NCAA hand it out," said Luicci. "But it's not." 
</P>
<P>
One factor that always seems to rule out candidates is age. Call it the 
wait-till-next year syndrome. It might affect Ware, a junior, and certainly 
will put Colorado quarterback Darian Hagan and Notre Dame 
flanker-tailback-kick-returner Raghib Ismail, both sophomores, back in the 
pack. But their stats deserve some attention. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics are one reason that Rice won't win. Though he has made big plays in 
big games, he has had too many days when he was 1-for-7 passing and had 55 
yards rushing. The party line in South Bend, Ind., is that opposing defenses 
are geared to stop Rice, but the same is true for most of the other top 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the emergence of Ismail, as well as the abundance of tailbacks at 
Notre Dame, should give Rice more of an opportunity to stand out. Conversely, 
Thompson, Emmitt Smith of Florida and Penn State's Blair Thomas play on teams 
with virtually no passing game. 
</P>
<P>
But Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz, who still won't vote his team No. 1 in the 
country, said this week that he would pick Rice if he had a say in the Heisman. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't trade Tony Rice for any player in the country -- bar none," Holtz 
said. "I don't know another quarterback to do the things that Tony Rice has 
done. The main thing with Tony Rice is that he's a complete quarterback, a 
leader, a winner. He makes the throws when he has to. I don't know if anybody 
can get the statistics for us the way we do things." 
</P>
<P>
When Tim Brown won the Heisman as a Notre Dame senior in 1987, he didn't have 
the kind of statistics as during his junior year. Nor did he match up in a 
numbers game with Syracuse quarterback Don McPherson. It didn't matter that the 
Fighting Irish lost their last three games after an 8-1 start, or that Syracuse 
finished 11-0-1 and nearly won the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Momentum from his junior year, and an early-season game against Michigan State 
-- in which he ran back two successive punts for touchdowns -- gave Brown an 
insurmountable lead on the field. Even Dick MacPherson was not disturbed by 
Brown's getting the award. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Tim Brown did some things to excite a lot of people," said MacPherson. 
"For a guy like Donnie McPherson to come out of nowhere like he did (in the 
Heisman voting) really helped him. I was very happy for Tim Brown. What we 
really have to understand is that a deserving young man is usually going to get 
the award." 
</P>
<P>
Deserving, perhaps. But not always the best college football player in the 
country.
