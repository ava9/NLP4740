<P>
Four-and-oh is no fluke. Stamp the Raiders as legitimate Super Bowl contenders 
after the way they handled the previously unbeaten Chicago Bears. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the only thing that could keep the Raiders out of the expanded playoffs 
would be more injuries. They've had enough already to deplete an ordinary team. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 80,156 was the biggest in the NFL this season, but not among the 
best behaved despite the push to make the Coliseum a nicer place on Sunday 
afternoons. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Scoreboard message that was ignored by many fans, mostly in the east end: "Be A 
Team Player -- Root Responsibly!" . . . 
</P>
<P>
Block of the Day: Marcus Allen's demolition of Richard Dent during a 20-yard 
Jay Schroeder- to-Mervyn Fernandez pass play early in the fourth quarter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who isn't forcing anything, is making all the right decisions. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Raider defense has scored three more touchdowns than the Pittsburgh Steeler 
offense this season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
An early defensive rookie of the year candidate is linebacker Aaron Wallace. . 
. Strangest penalty of the day was the one assessed against the Bears for 12 
men on the field -- on the first play after a timeout. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Thumbs up to Raider Steve Wright, who has filled in superbly for the injured 
Bruce Wilkerson at offensive right tackle. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Who would you rather have as your offensive coordinator, the Vikings' Joe 
Schnelker or the Steelers' Joe Walton? . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to believe, but the Cleveland Browns, Minnesota Vikings and 
Philadelphia Eagles are each 1-3. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The New England Patriots got what they deserved Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This has been a great year for Eddie Murray, the Dodger slugger, but a lousy 
one for Eddie Murray, the Detroit Lions' kicker. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's time to give the Cincinnati Reds some credit. 
</P>
<P>
They bent, but didn't break. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest reason the Pittsburgh Pirates won the NL East pennant is that they 
were hungrier than the New York Mets. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I liked Comiskey Park better than Wrigley Field. . . . 
</P>
<P>
However, a different name should have been given the new park across the 
street. Bill Veeck Stadium would have been perfect, but White Sox owner Jerry 
Reinsdorf wasn't a big fan of the greatest showman in baseball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This is Tom Lasorda's second best job of managing. His best was in 1988 when 
the Dodgers won the World Series with maybe the weakest lineup ever in the 
Series. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This will be remembered as the year the New York Yankees and St. Louis 
Cardinals finished last. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lost and found: The USC and UCLA rushing attacks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In Nevada, all bets are called off if 55 minutes or more aren't played in a 
football game. The USC-Ohio State game was stopped after 57 minutes and 24 
seconds. . . . 
</P>
<P>
John Cooper should ask his athletic director never to schedule Larry Smith 
again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
UCLA-Washington State was an exciting game, but were you able to stay up until 
the end? It didn't end until around 11:30 p.m. because of the late starting 
time dictated by ESPN and all those TV commercials. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Maddox is going to make Bruin football exciting for the next three-plus 
years -- or until he opts for the NFL draft. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Hype of the week: ESPN announcer Wayne Larrivee calling Northern Illinois 
quarterback Stacey Robinson a "bonafide Heisman Trophy candidate" before the 
Huskies were routed by mighty Northwestern. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Despite its come-from-ahead defeat to Notre Dame in South Bend on opening 
night, Michigan may have the best team in the nation. On a bad day, the 
Wolverines still were able to handle decent Maryland, 45-17. . . . 
</P>
<P>
BYU quarterback Ty Detmer on being intercepted five times by Oregon: "I threw 
'em, they caught 'em." . . . 
</P>
<P>
So much for the hot Arizonas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Auburn Coach Pat Dye sure loves ties. He wore a grin and waved his cap to the 
fans on his way to the dressing room after the Tigers' 26-26 tie with 
Tennessee. And remember that draw with Syracuse in the Sugar Bowl? . . . 
</P>
<P>
If Dye had gone for one point instead of two when the Tigers trailed 19-9, they 
would have won Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State freshman running back Robert Smith had his problems against USC, but 
he's a dead ringer for O.J. Simpson with those long, graceful strides. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bad taste award: To CBS for reporting that New York Jets Coach Bruce Coslet was 
fined by the NFL for making an obscene gesture -- and then showing it on "The 
NFL Today." . . . 
</P>
<P>
No changes were reported over the weekend in the NFC West standings or Willie 
McGee's National League batting average.
