Area source emissions were calculated using a variety of information sources and guidance from the USEPA. Where appropriate,
point source emissions have been subtracted from the calculated area source emissions to account for source coverage
overlap. For all appropriate source categories, the State and the City of Indianapolis assumed a rule effectiveness
level of 80 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In preparing the area source emissions, the State and the City of Indianapolis used the following USEPA guidance documents:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedures for the Preparation of Emission Inventories for Carbon Monoxide and Precursors of Ozone, Volumes I and
II, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;91&hyph;016 and EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;91&hyph;014, May 1991; and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;81&hyph;026d, revised July 1989. The new Volume IV guidance, issued in the Spring of 1992,
was used to estimate railroad and aircraft emissions. Estimates of other off-road mobile source emissions were based
on USEPA's 1991 off-road mobile source emission study. In making other area source estimates, the State and the City
of Indianapolis followed the approved IPP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has entered the calculated area source emission estimates into USEPA's AIRS Area and Mobile Source System
(AIRS/AMS). The data are well documented in both hardcopy and in computer data files submitted with the emission inventory
submittals as additional documentation.

On-road mobile source emissions were calculated using USEPA's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (as revised in 1989) and USEPA's MOBILE5A model. Daily Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) and speed data by county and roadway
type were obtained from the Indiana Department of Transportation (InDOT), who used the Highway Performance Monitoring
System (HPMS) to determine VMT by roadway functional class. The VMT provided by InDOT were annual average daily traffic
levels. Insufficient data existed to allow the VMT to be adjusted to the summer months and the day of week levels. To
quality assure the VMT estimates, the local Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) were requested to confirm
the VMT estimates or to correct them if needed based on more representative data. The VMT were quality assured through
comparison with current roadway traffic counts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MPOs recommended vehicle speeds based on the use of local transportation models (the MINUTP transportation model
was used in the Evansville, Louisville (Clark and Floyd Counties, Indiana), and South Bend/Elkhart areas, while
the City of Indianapolis chose to use the default speeds recommended by the USEPA in MOBILE5A). The speeds derived
using the MINUTP transportation model were on average higher than the default speeds recommended by the USEPA. Nonetheless
the MPOs believe the model-generated speeds are more representative of their areas than the recommended default
speeds and are justified on observations of actual traffic flow rates (no monitored speeds were presented to defend
these conclusions). The estimated speeds were used in conjunction with USEPA recommended defaults for vehicle mixtures
to determine emission rates for each roadway type. Fuel volatility was assumed to comply with USEPA requirements
for the areas. The ambient temperatures used in the mobile source emissions modeling were derived from the average
maximum and minimum temperatures on the ten highest ozone days for the period of 1988 through 1990 for each area using
an approach recommended by the USEPA. The emission factors determined using MOBILE5A were combined with the total
VMT for each functional roadway class to determine the total mobile source emissions for each county. All parameters
used in the mobile source emissions modeling, including the parameters used by the MOBILE5A model, were well documented.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The biogenic emissions for each of the counties were determined using USEPA's PC-BEIS model. Included in the documentation
of the applications of this model were descriptions of the methodology used to determine temperature inputs for the
model. The temperature inputs were determined using the technique recommended by the USEPA. The applications of
PC-BEIS also included the use of land use data supplied by the USEPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Indiana held public hearings on the Evansville, Clark and Floyd Counties, and South Bend/Elkhart emission
inventories on June 28, 1993, and July 6, 1993. Comments received during these public hearings were used to make appropriate
corrections in the emission inventories. A public hearing on the Indianapolis emission inventory submittal was
held on November 5, 1993.
