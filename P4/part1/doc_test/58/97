THE Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) is a tightly disciplined and very
effective machine.
It has dominated Spanish politics for nearly a decade because it is better
organised than any of its national conservative or radical rivals. But its
very discipline has meant it has been impossible for good politicians to
project themselves beyond the party and, assuming Mr Felipe Gonzalez fights
only one more election as Prime Minister, it is hard to be precise about his
possible successors.
An election has to be held before October 1993 and the next one four years
later. All that is too late for one of the wisest men in the Cabinet, the
foreign minister, Mr Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, and too early, probably,
for one of the brightest battle tested politicians in the party, Mr Ramon
Jauregui, PSOE leader in the Basque Country.
Two things are, however, likely: a replacement to fight the last election of
the century will come from within the party and, second, anyone too closely
associated with the former left wing deputy prime minister and current party
vice president, Mr Alfonso Guerra, would probably be unelectable.
Five possible candidates to replace Mr Gonzalez are briefly profiled, in
alphabetical order, below:
Jose Bono Martinez: A lawyer and president of the autonomous region of
Castilla-La Mancha in central Spain since 1983.
He was once considered a confidante of Alfonso Guerra, who runs the party
machine. But Felipe Gonzalez has begun to lean on regional leaders like Mr
Bono to offset left wing pressure from party headquarters in Madrid, drawing
them closer to Government and away from party.
Mr Bono is developing a reputation as a socialist powerbroker and allowed
himself to be associated in public with the conservative finance minister,
Mr Carlos Solchaga, when the latter was being shunned by many party
colleagues. That did not necessarily mean support, but rather an attempt to
appear above intra-party bickering. The press likes him.
Jose Borrell Fontelles: Young and intense, Borrell is minister of Public
Works and Transport, the biggest spender in the Cabinet.
Secretary of State for the revenue service until his elevation to the
Cabinet last year, Borrell has, along with the Prime Minister, probably the
most pristine reputation in Government. It was Borrell who persuaded tax
evasion charges against the brother of former deputy premier Alfonso Guerra.
Increasingly independent, he is not greatly liked in party headquarters but
that may not be a long-term handicap. The longer Gonzalez remains in office,
the brighter Borrell's prospects. As minister for public works, he is able
to score political points by associating himself with the country's grandest
projects.
Narcis Serra i Serra: Deputy Prime Minister and the most likely successor to
Gonzalez in the short term. A consummate politician, Serra has been given
the task of smoothing poor relations between the Government and party
officials unhappy with conservative economic policy. Also, he is Catalan
(and speaks it) which is a plus for any PSOE leader as Spain's regions -
Catalonia being the strongest - press for more autonomy.
An accomplished pianist, Serra was Mayor of Barcelona in the 1970s and made
his political mark as Defence Minister between 1982 and 1991, familiarising
an unhappy military with the joys of democracy. The party machine is warming
to him but he has little public charisma and would not be an impressive
campaigner.
Javier Solana Madariaga: Education Minister and former culture minister and
government spokesman. Solana has managed to push controversial education
reforms through without alienating the unions or students. He nevertheless
keeps a low profile. His position in the party is strong and he is the
senior Madrileno in the executive.
Solana has managed to escape being identified too closely with either the
left or right of the party, though for a while in the 1980s his brother's
chairmanship of the telephone monopoly Telefonica and, later, the
state-owned television and radio stations invited some accusations of
nepotism. Probably a conservative, he would become a compromise candidate in
a race between stronger claimants.
Carlos Solchaga Catalan: The architect of the socialist government's rapid
drift towards liberal market economic policies, Solchaga probably has more
political enemies than any other Spanish politician today.
He has a small power base in his home region of Navarra but the party is
deeply suspicious of him. Relenting on big budget cuts planned for this year
helped that relationship.
Mostly, Solchaga speaks to Gonzalez and Serra, who then tell the party what
new misery he plans to inflict on socialism. It makes it unlikely the party
could ever bring itself to elect him leader, or prime ministerial candidate,
but that does not mean he would not want the job. Confident and dismissive
of doubters, he is the best infighter in the Cabinet.
