The Spanish government, which has taken a strong line on terms for admitting
Nordic countries and Austria to the European Union, said yesterday it was
confident negotiations would be successfully completed by the March 1
deadline.
The optimistic assessment by Mr Carlos Westendorp, Spain's state secretary
for the European Communities, coincided with a private meeting in Madrid
between Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, and Mr Jacques Delors,
president of the European Commission.
Mr Westendorp said there were now 'very few problems left'. Argument over
aid for under-populated areas of Finland, Norway and Sweden had been
'satisfactorily resolved' by the EU's proposal on Tuesday to set up a
separate regional fund, which would leave intact the current criteria for
support given to the EU''s poorest regions.
Enlargement was the EU''s most important and urgent task, Mr Westendorp
said.
He denied that Spain was insisting on budget contributions from the four
countries being channelled into 'cohesion funds' for the poorer states. It
was prepared to see the estimated Ecu2bn (Dollars 2.2bn) a year in new
contributions either spent on the full range of EU policies, including
agriculture, or used to reduce the overall budget burden.
Spain was still trying to ensure that enlargement would not damage its
chances of meeting the 'convergence' criteria for economic and monetary
union. But Mr Westendorp said it would be satisfied with a 'political
declaration' to this effect.
Still to be resolved was the question of Spanish fishing rights in Norwegian
waters, closed off by Norway since 1981. Mr Westendorp indicated that
Madrid''s request for rights to 14,000 tonnes a year was open to
negotiation.
Also to be settled were arrangements for qualified majority voting in the
enlarged community. Spain wants to ensure that alliances of three or more
countries which can now block EU decisions can continue to do so.
