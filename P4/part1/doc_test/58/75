  [Text] Madrid, 1 Mar (EFE) -- On the second day of his 
state visit to Spain, Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem 
stated on 1 March that his government "will do its utmost" so 
Aerolineas Argentinas can reach a speedy settlement with the 
Spanish carrier Iberia. 
  During a news conference at El Pardo Palace, the Argentine 
head of state stated that negotiations with Iberia are not on 
his agenda of talks with the Spanish head of government, Felipe 
Gonzalez. He said nonetheless that he hoped both delegations' 
experts "make their calculations again and work out an 
agreement" in the forthcoming days. 
  In the meantime, Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo 
on 28 February in Buenos Aires that negotiations between Iberia 
and the Argentine Government geared to overcoming Aerolineas 
Argentinas' financial crisis have been suspended after a 
decision by the Spanish company. 
  Commenting on another subject, Menem on 1 March announced 
that Argentina might join NAFTA in June. 
  The Argentine president was full of optimism that his 
country, together with Colombia and Chile, will be able to join 
NAFTA -- established between Canada, the United States, and 
Mexico -- without having to sever its current commitments with 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. 
  "It is a question of making room for both agreements. It 
goes without saying that if this is achieved Argentina will 
stand to gain a lot," he said, adding that his country endorses 
the U.S. project to create a free trade zone from Alaska to 
Tierra del Fuego. 
  Menem was proud of his administration's economic 
achievements, noting that his privatization policy was 
instrumental in curbing inflation -- which in 1989-1990 ran at 
approximately 22,000 percent -- to an estimated 4.5 percent this 
year. 
  Menem believes the success of his economic policy "has no 
secret. Markets have been totally liberated and an all-out 
campaign against the fiscal deficit has been waged. We had to 
perform major surgery without giving a general anesthetic and we 
have obtained exceptional results. Argentina is at present the 
country with the highest growth rate in the world following the 
PRC and Thailand." 
  Menem noted: "It is all very well to say so, but it is quite 
difficult to do it." He observed that the state's action has 
been limited to "only the fields of justice, sanitation, 
education, and security; the rest has been entrusted to the 
private sector." 
  He added: "This privatization formula together with a dose 
of wit and wisdom and a bit of luck have enabled us to turn 
deficit-ridden state-owned enterprises like the telephone and 
petroleum ones into profitable companies that pay taxes." 
  To this effect he remarked that Spanish entrepreneurs who 
followed Gonzalez' advice concerning investments [in Argentina] 
"are getting great results." He praised "the excellent" 
bilateral relations between both countries. 
  Menem skirted the issue of his ideological and personal 
preference for either the head of government, Felipe Gonzalez, 
or Jose Maria Aznar, the president of the leading opposition 
party, the Popular Party, whom he met at El Pardo Palace on 1 
March. 
  "They are both friends of mine," he commented. "It is 
important not to tie oneself down to ideological considerations 
but rather to assess results, and both of them are contributing 
greatly to democracy and freedom." 
  Menem added that the difference between Gonzalez and Aznar 
"lies in the fact that Gonzalez is heading the government and 
Aznar has not yet had the opportunity to do so. And I can tell 
you from experience that it is one thing to engage in politics 
from this side of the counter and a very different thing to do 
so from the outside." 
  He underlined the role his country is playing in the 
international scene, noting that an Argentine contingent of 
1,350 men is currently part of the UN peacekeeping forces -- of 
whom 1,078 are in Bosnia and the rest in Cyprus and Kuwait -- 
and is "ready to pay heed to UN requirements." 
  Regarding possible mediation between the United States and 
Cuba, Menem said: "I have never offered myself as a mediator so 
democracy may be re-established in Cuba, but I do share the 
Ibero-American hope that Castro will accept democratic rule and 
Cubans can soon elect their rulers." 
  Menem accepted the press' meddling in his private life with 
resignation. "I cannot prevent it. They have the freedom to 
say what is true and what is not. I assumed office having a 
specific personal situation and my people know me and elected me 
just as I am." 
  The Argentine president may run for the presidency a second 
time if the constitutional reform -- which was the outcome of a 
"very fruitful" dialogue and agreement with the Radical Civic 
Union's Raul Alfonsin -- is passed. He said: "If I do my 
homework well I may be elected. Otherwise, let them elect 
someone else who does better than I."
