FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Seville and World Expo '92 (2): Admiration and a
twinge of envy - Spain is all agog at the scale of the project

EXPO '92 IS, on the face of it, a custom-built super-city with a six-month
life span on a river island alongside Seville. But it is a lot more than
just that and the rest of Spain is muttering as a result.
Barcelona envies Seville its 300kph high speed train link with Madrid; and
Madrid, cursed with a wholly inadequate airport, wonders why Seville's has
passenger terminals quite out of proportion both to its runway facilities
and to its projected traffic.
Valencia, Spain's third city, is upset about both the train link and the
airport and it asks why, as an infinitely busier commercial centre, it has
not been favoured with fibre-optic communications, with 70kms worth of
ringroads and with a dual carriage highway to Madrid.
Spaniards in general would not begrudge Seville a couple of new bridges to
help it straddle its Guadalquivir river. But eight?
Seville's new bridges have doubled the city's existing number and three of
them lead solely to the Expo island. Industrial Bilbao, hemmed in by the
Nervion river, could certainly have done with a few of them.
The government, led by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez who is Sevillian born
and bred, attempts to silence the mutterers by insisting that Expo is a
modernising vehicle for one of Spain's least favoured regions; that there is
far more to the Exposition than the 'come to the big party' hype would
suggest.
Mr Gonzalez frequently voices fears that Spain's richer areas, near the
French frontier, will surge ahead in a Single Market Europe while the
Southern belt of Andalucia, which lies within sight of Africa, risks a
barren future.
The threat of widening regional imbalances during the 1990s is real enough
and the Prime Minister is determined to prevent his home region decoupling
from the rest of Spain.
Expo thus represents development economics with a vengeance. More than
Pta900bn in the past five years has been pumped by the government into an
area whose GDP is 20 per cent lower than the national average and 54 per
cent of that of the EC.
According to the government's thinking, market forces will improve
Valencia's infrastructure and they will pay for the airport overhaul that is
overdue in Madrid. They will also ensure a bullet train between Madrid and
Barcelona and beyond to the French frontier.
But were it not for Expo no meaningful capital investment, public or
private, would have been lured to Southern Spain. Certainly the high speed
tracks would never have reached Seville.
Now, as Expo prepares to pack in the public, the administration's focus has
uncompromisingly shifted from the Exposition itself to what happens
afterwards to Seville and to Andalucia. There are few worries about the 18m
who are expected to visit Expo. There is more concern over what will occur
at the Exposition site when its last visitor has left.
A project called Cartuja '93, named after the Cartuja island where the
exposition stands, has been set up with the future specifically in mind. It
seeks to fuel the technological development of the region by exploiting the
global promotion that Seville will receive over the next six months and by
re-utilising Expo's infrastructure and equipment.
Funded by the Spanish government with the Andalucia regional executive and
the Seville city council as minority partners, Cartuja '93 is a state
project backed by Spanish and European research bodies including the EC's
Institute for Prospective Technology and the International Centre for
Technology Transfer. According to Expo commissioner-general Emilio
Cassinello, it is 'the most important and ambitious programme' of the whole
1992 extravaganza.
The hoped for scientific and technological complex has been given something
of a start by those Expo participants that have already said they wish to
remain on the site after the show is over. Italy seeks to convert its
pavilion into an industrial design centre and IBM will base a Language
Technology laboratory in its corporate pavilion with the aim of transferring
to Spanish its breakthroughs in voice synthesis and recognition.
Siemens and Rank Xerox are also understood to be studying continued use of
their Expo pavilions and France has announced that its building will stay on
the Cartuja island to house the biggest French cultural and bibliographical
research centre outside Paris.
Mr Rafael de la Cruz, a former senior official in the Spanish Treasury who
was appointed Cartuja '93 chairman last October, says that he remains
'flexible' about the sort of businesses which will be welcomed into the
future park. Much of his work to date has concerned with negotiating the
details of fiscal breaks and other incentives to attract investment.
The project's main promotional effort will start as soon as Expo opens its
doors to the public. 'The six months of the exposition are going to be
fundamental because they will allow us to explain our objectives,' Mr de la
Cruz says. He claims two dozen companies so far have expressed an initial
interest in the park.
The success or failure of Expo '92 will be judged by the subsequent fortunes
of Cartuja '93. Only if the project turns into a genuinely viable scientific
and technological park propelling Andalucia into the 21st century will the
immense investment be justified and the mutterers silenced.
