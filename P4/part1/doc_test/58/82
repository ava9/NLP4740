  [Text] The Spanish foreign and agriculture ministers, 
Javier Solana and Vicente Albero, respectively, are well pleased 
by the agreement on fishing reached with Norway. This is one of 
the issues that was blocking the EU [European Union] enlargement 
negotiations. 
  Speaking in Brussels, Javier Solana described the agreement 
as reasonable although he admitted that it is not all that Spain 
had asked for. The Spanish foreign minister highlighted that 
the quotas are not the main point this agreement. The end of 
the transitory regime in 1996 instead of in the year 2003 is 
more important [Spain will be able to fish in all EU waters in 
1996 instead of waiting until 2003]. 
  For his part, Vicente Albero told this radio station that 
Spanish companies can establish joint ventures in Norway and 
thus fish on the Norwegian quota. 
  He added that Spanish fishermen will have access to the 
Norwegian fishing grounds and that the fishing quota has finally 
been increased. 
  On another hand, next Tuesday [22 March], the EU will have 
to 
solve the institutional dispute about the voting system in the 
Council of Ministers. According to the Greek presidency, this 
will be the last chance if blocking the EU enlargement is to be 
avoided. 
  Despite a long meeting, the Community foreign ministers were 
unable to reach an agreement on how many votes will be needed in 
a 16-member Council of Ministers to block a decision. 
  Spain and the United Kingdom want, for very different 
reasons, the blocking minority to stay at 23 votes while the 
rest of the countries favor increasing it to 27 votes when the 
four new members join.
