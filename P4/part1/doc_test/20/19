Scientists have taken a big step towards understanding the genetic basis of
diabetes, which affects 150,000 people in the UK. They have used a
rapid-search technique to identify two genes likely to lead to the disease.
Mr James Copeman, an author of one of two papers describing the results in
the journal Nature today, says the technique means research into diabetes
and other complex diseases is going to move very rapidly in the next 10
years.
One of the papers, published by a group of 16 scientists from institutions
in the UK, identifies new genes predisposing to insulin-dependent diabetes
on chromosome 11 and on chromosome 6. Independently, 14 scientists from
institutes in France, the UK and the US have also identified the gene on
chromosome 11.
This independent confirmation of one of the genes is an important validation
of the new technique for finding the genes for complex diseases - those that
are influenced by more than one gene - which include schizophrenia, heart
disease and cancer.
Mr Copeman said the UK research group would pursue two lines of work: to
study the way the two newly identified genes worked and to search for more
genes.
So far the group has identified 16 further possible locations in its search
of the whole genome - the complete set of human genes. Mr Copeman suspects
about 10 of these will turn out to be important for diabetes. Checking each
possible location takes two months.
In insulin-dependent diabetes the patient's immune system destroys the
insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas. Insulin is essential for the uptake
of glucose into cells. Of the four genes identified so far the most
important is IDDM1, which was already identified, and appears to be involved
in the development of the immune system. The other three genes, the two new
ones and IDDM2, appear to be of roughly equal importance.
The research involved comparing the genetic material from pairs of diabetic
children in a group of 96 diabetic families. By identifying regions of the
genome that are the same in both children, suspect locations can be
identified. The research used a set of 'markers' - parts of the genome that
are present in everybody - to identify exactly which parts of the genome
contained the suspect genes.
