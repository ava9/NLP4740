Future of Human Medicine"] 
  [Text] Paris--Thanks to new animal-genetics techniques, 
researchers are about to manufacture mutant rabbits and pigs 
capable of producing molecules that will cure human diseases, or 
whose organs can be transplanted in man. 
  The key to this research is transgenesis, a leading-edge 
technique used by INRA [National Institute for Agronomic 
Research] researchers for some 12 years to transfer genes from 
one species to another. One of the principal objectives of gene 
transfer is to cause mutant animals to produce some valuable 
molecules that will cure human diseases such as AIDS, 
arteriosclerosis, or the lack of red blood cells, or to be able 
to transplant animal organs in man. 
  Thus, in recent months the INRA researchers have managed to 
implant some human genes into rabbits by micro-injections, so 
that the rabbits' milk will produce factor 8 which is used to 
treat hemophiliacs, Louis-Marie Houdebine, a specialist working 
at the Jouy-en-Josas INRA, explained. 
  It is precisely to get this molecule, which is present in 
human blood and very hard to manufacture artificially, that 
hemophiliacs were getting human blood transfusions, and were 
occasionally contaminated with the AIDS virus. Another 
application about to be achieved is to have rabbit's milk 
manufacture the hormone that causes red blood cell to multiply. 
  To the great excitement of the international scientific 
community, three months ago the Strasbourg INRA, in 
collaboration with the pharmaceutical division of the 
Rhone-Poulenc group, managed to create rabbits resistant to 
arteriosclerosis by implanting in them the human genes that 
confer resistance to the disease. 
  The INRA is also researching the implantation of certain 
human genes on pigs, in order to make the pigs' organs "human" 
enough to be transplanted in man without being rejected; the 
organs include the heart, liver, kidneys, and some 
insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. This research is in the 
in-vitro stage, but the concept is working, Mr. Houdebine 
emphasized. 
  Researchers also managed to implant the AIDS receptor gene 
(CD4) into rabbits, thus creating rabbits that can be infected 
by the human AIDS virus. This type of application is of course 
precious for medical research.
