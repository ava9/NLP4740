SCIENTISTS yesterday claimed a 'breakthrough' in the genetic engineering of
pigs to provide organs for transplantation to humans.
Researchers from DNX Biotherapeutics of Princeton, New Jersey, told a
conference in Cambridge that they had bred animals with human genes which
would prevent their organs being rejected by the patient's immune system
after transplant-ation.
'If we are able to maintain our current rate of progress, DNX should be
poised to begin human clinical testing of transgenic pig organs in three to
five years,' said Dr John Logan, the company's head of research. Kidneys and
hearts are likely to be used first.
If unaltered pig organs were transplanted to humans, they would be destroyed
within hours by part of the immune system called 'complement' which is
normally held in check by 'inhibition factors'. With genetic engineering,
the DNX scientists have produced pigs that make two human inhibition
factors.
Patients are expected to react to the transgenic organs as they would to a
transplant from another human. They will still need to be treated with drugs
to suppress the immune system, but the pig organs are likely to last for as
long as their human equivalents.
Mr Steven Holtzman, DNX president, said the company wanted to solve the
severe worldwide shortage of transplant organs by breeding special herds of
transgenic pigs.
'We estimate that at least 100,000 patients worldwide could then receive
transplants.'
'We believe it is ethical to use an animal to save a human life,' Mr
Holtzman added, though he conceded that some animal rights advocates would
find the work unacceptable.
Asked about possible religious objections to pig transplants, he said: 'We
have taken rabbinical advice and for Jews it is a dietary prohibition, so
there is no bar to the use of pig organs. I don't know what the Koran has to
say on this.'
