FT  24 APR 92 / Leading Article: Don't patent human genes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Institutes of Health, the US government's medical research arm,
has created turmoil in the biotechnology industry and outrage in academic
science by filing almost 3,000 patent applications for human genes whose
function is still unknown.
The most prominent casualty of the storm so far is James Watson, who
discovered the structure of genes 40 years ago. He resigned last week as
head of the US-led Human Genome Project, part of a Dollars 3bn international
effort to work out the entire genetic blueprint for human beings. Watson's
bitter opposition to the NIH patenting policy was a primary reason for his
forced resignation.
Although the technical details of the dispute seem esoteric, the financial
and medical implications are enormous. A large part of the biotechnology
industry in the next century will depend on knowing the detailed sequence of
human genes. Converting that knowledge indiscriminately into marketable
intellectual property, as NIH is trying to do, would damage the development
of the industry. It might also inhibit academic research leading to cures
for diseases such as forms of cancer that cannot even be treated today.
International action is needed urgently to sort out the confusion caused by
NIH's precipitate action - which was taken with the approval of the Bush
administration - and create a new framework for genetic patents. The OECD
would be a suitable forum in which to develop an agreement outlawing the
indiscriminate patenting of genes. It should still be possible to patent the
discovery of individual genes whose function and potential commercial uses
are specified.
Pre-emptive strike
Allan Bromley, President Bush's science adviser, defends the US move as a
pre-emptive strike to defend the interests of the American taxpayer against
private companies which, NIH believed, were preparing to bombard the Patent
Office with similar applications. But it has already had a disastrous impact
on international co-operation in genetic research.
The UK Medical Research Council, backed by the government, is preparing to
retaliate by filing US patent applications next month for more than 1,000
genes discovered by its scientists, using automatic sequencing machines like
the NIH researchers. The MRC says it wants an international ban on such
patents but in the absence of an agreement it has to 'protect the UK
position'.
Other countries with substantial DNA sequencing programmes - notably Japan,
France, Germany and Italy - are not only opposing the US action but also
resisting the temptation to retaliate like the MRC by filing their own
patents. In characteristic style, Hurbert Curien, the French science
minister, took the moral high ground with his declaration that 'a patent
should not be granted for something that is part of our universal heritage'.
National interests
The European countries are angry with the MRC for condemning the NIH and
then following its lead. But they are protecting national interests by
refusing to send genes discovered by their scientists to an international
DNA database which the MRC recently set up in London with EC funding. Their
reaction shows how the NIH patent applications are inhibiting the
information exchange that should underpin basic medical research.
It is possible, of course, that the US Patent Office will resolve the
problem simply by rejecting the NIH and MRC applications, on the ground that
they fail to specify a practical use for the genes. If so, the biotechnology
industry will breathe an immense sigh of relief. But experts say it would be
unwise to count on this, because the US is remarkably liberal in its
interpretation of what makes a valid patent.
Biotechnology is already bedevilled by disputes over intellectual property,
which have enriched hundreds of patent lawyers over the past decade while
inhibiting the development of the industry. But the NIH move on gene
fragments brings a threat of patent wars on an even larger scale. It will be
in the interests of all parties - even the US taxpayers whose interests NIH
claims to protect - to agree that mass-produced genes cannot be patented.
