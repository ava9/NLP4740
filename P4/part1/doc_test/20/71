Section III-C&hyph;5-b. BL3&hyph;P or BL2&hyph;P + biological containment is recommended for experiments involving
plants containing cloned genomes of readily transmissible exotic (see Section V-W) infectious agents with recognized

The appropriate containment will be decided by the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Where appropriate, Appendix

Certain experiments involving the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one
or more human subjects that are not covered by Sections III-A&hyph;2, III-B&hyph;2, III-B&hyph;3, and that are not
considered exempt under Section V-U must be registered with NIH/ORDA. The relevant Institutional Biosafety Committee
and Institutional Review Board must review and approve all experiments in this category prior to their initiation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Experiments not included in Sections III-A, III-B, III-C, III-E, and their subsections are considered in Section
III-D. All such experiments may be conducted at BL1 containment. For experiments in this category, a registration
document (see Section III-C) shall be dated and signed by the investigator and filed with the local Institutional
Biosafety Committee at the time the experiment is initiated. The Institutional Biosafety Committee reviews and
approves all such proposals, but Institutional Biosafety Committee review and approval prior to initiation of the
experiment is not required (see Section IV-A). For example, experiments in which all components derived from non-pathogenic
prokaryotes and non-pathogenic lower eukaryotes fall under Section III-D and may be conducted at BL1 containment.

Recombinant DNA molecules containing no more than two-thirds of the genome of any eukaryotic virus (all viruses from
a single Family (see Section V-Q) being considered identical (see Section V-S)) may be propagated and maintained
in cells in tissue culture using BL1 containment. For such experiments, it must be demonstrated that the cells lack
helper virus for the specific Families of defective viruses being used. If helper virus is present, procedures specified
under Section III-C&hyph;3 should be used. The DNA may contain fragments of the genome of viruses from more than one
Family but each fragment shall be less than two-thirds of a genome.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section covers experiments involving recombinant DNA-modified whole plants, and/or experiments involving
recombinant DNA-modified organisms associated with whole plants, except those that fall under Section III-A, III-B,
III-C, or III-E. It should be emphasized that knowledge of the organisms and judgment based on accepted scientific
practices should be used in all cases in selecting the appropriate level of containment. For example, if the genetic
modification has the objective of increasing pathogenicity or converting a non-pathogenic organism into a pathogen,
then a higher level of containment may be appropriate depending on the organism, its mode of dissemination, and its
target organisms. By contrast, a lower level of containment may be appropriate for small animals associated with
many types of recombinant DNA-modified plants.

Section III-D&hyph;2-a. BL1&hyph;P is recommended for all experiments with recombinant DNA-containing plants
and plant-associated microorganisms not covered in Section III-D&hyph;2-b or other sections of the NIH Guidelines.
Examples of such experiments are those involving recombinant DNA-modified plants that are not noxious weeds or that
cannot interbreed with noxious weeds in the immediate geographic area, and experiments involving whole plants and
recombinant DNA-modified non-exotic (see Section V-W) microorganisms that have no recognized potential for rapid
and widespread dissemination or for serious detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems (e.g.,
