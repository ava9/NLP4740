BACKWARD STEP

One small step backward for man, one giant step backward for mankind is the way 
the port commissioners' vote for naming the new convention center can be 
interpreted ("Port Rejects King's Name on S.D. Center," July 26). Ironically, 
it happened the week after we have celebrated the 20th anniversary of the walk 
on the moon, the big step forward for mankind. 
</P>
<P>
Why did Milford Portwood, Raymond Burk, Robert Penner and Daniel Larsen oppose 
the renaming? After all, the democratic process was followed with Rev. Clyde 
Gaines leading a citizens' committee for 10 months that came up with that 
recommendation. How does Larsen justify his stand? Did he capitulate to the 
good old boys? Is he that insensitive to followers of Dr. Martin Luther King, 
to the children who seek a role model, a distinguished black man, a reminder of 
what we can become? 
</P>
<P>
The distinguished Dr. Martin Luther King will not suffer for the loss. He's 
been inscribed in history as the symbol of non-violence, a man of fairness. Who 
will suffer? San Diegans will miss the opportunity of being reminded of what 
Dr. King did in his short time here. The generic convention center won't have 
Dr. King's name. It's a missed opportunity to promote non-violence in an age of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
When we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Apollo in July of 1999, we will 
also recall the 10th anniversary of the name-change vote, a bad day in San 
Diego's history where four men took a terrible step backward.
