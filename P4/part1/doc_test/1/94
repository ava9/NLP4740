Some of us fancy that when - if - the British government regains its balance
its true nature will be revealed. We will at last perceive that the
administration that was formed after the downfall of the then Mrs Margaret
Thatcher in 1990 is centrist, with a tendency to dabble in the red arts of
the social and interventionist left. As President George Bush moved away
from the Reagan right, so Mr John Major is likely to detach himself from
Thatcherism. That is the conventional wisdom among Tories of the cast of
mind that was once called 'wet'.
It is almost certainly wrong. The prime minister's secret agenda, which is
an open book, is to survive. Events will determine his policies. Each
decision will be carefully weighed. Does it help the government regain its
authority? Will the backbenches have it? Only proposals that produce a 'yes'
to both questions will pass.
Mr Major is not made of the material with which the heavens construct
self-confident leaders, those who stand at the front of the column, feet
astride, arm out pointing the way ahead. There is no evidence that he is an
original political thinker possessed of a strong sense of direction. If he
developed into a giant of that kind it would be the biggest surprise since
the Americans unwrapped Mr Harry Truman and found a great president inside.
To observe as much is not to disregard the prime minister's considerable
strengths. His character is by now familiar. He is decent, and nobody's
fool. He is more impressive in private conclave than in public. He is
dogged, sometimes recklessly stubborn; if he is not a source of popular
inspiration then at least he is a man who draws inspiration from his party.
In common with several of his senior ministers - the chancellor springs to
mind - he is more responsive to the advice given by civil servants than were
either Lady Thatcher or some of her prominent colleagues. Like President
Bill Clinton, the prime minister is a policy 'wonk'; unlike the new occupant
of the White House, he is a wader through options rather than a salesman of
change.
This weekend Mr Major will celebrate the first anniversary of the 1992
general election, a contest in which he achieved a victory that he
understandably describes as 'sweet'. Yet it went sour very quickly. Over the
past year the Tories have been sorely divided, so much so that we have
enjoyed the delights of coalition government within a system designed to
provide stable, strong, stultifying, single-party administrations. The task
that this ordinary chap in an extraordinary job has set himself for his
second year as elected prime minister is clear. He will be the healer of
wounds, the party leader who reunites the Conservatives.
If you follow the argument so far, you may agree that what fate has in store
for our anti-hero is to plonk his administration firmly down on Thatcher
territory. The first act of healing will be to pump the hands and squeeze
the shoulders of all but the most recalcitrant of the Maastricht rebels.
Yes, I know that the squabble isn't over yet (I'll come to the Danish
referendum in a moment), but we must assume that it will be and that the
prime minister will have his treaty. If he does not - if the Maastricht bill
is defeated in parliament - there will be no Mr Major to discuss, except as
a pensioned-off previous occupant of No 10 Downing Street.
Let us take it, therefore, that the prime minister gets to the other side of
the Maastricht debate, either with his bill or, if the Danes vote 'no' a
second time, without it but with his job intact. In either circumstance his
European policy will be to pre-empt the next intergovernmental conference of
the member states of the European Community (in the case of a Danish upset)
or the European Union (post-Maastricht).
In short Mr Major will seek to set the agenda for Europe. Position papers
are already being prepared. As the supposedly Europhile Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, has indicated, this is likely to reinforce the concept of
the Community or European Union as a congeries of independent nation-states,
although the Germans can be expected to renew their efforts to create a true
federation.
Britain, which will be outside the exchange rate mechanism and nowhere near
approaching an opt-in to monetary union, will be governed by a Conservative
party whose leaders are united in their new-found Euro-scepticism, or, if
you prefer greater precision, anti-federalism. The prime minister will be at
the heart of Europe, but he may yet break Europe's heart.
Domestic policy is likewise Thatcher-led. There is apparently no limit to
privatisation. The previous prime minister shrank from denationalising coal,
the railways, the post office. Mr Major proposes to make plc's of them all,
while contracting out to the private sector previously inalienable
public-sector activities such as prison administration, tax collection and
just about everything else that moves. Formerly sacrosanct vested interests
 -the police, prison officers, the united corps of teachers - are being
challenged with the intent of facing them down.
Against all that the convening of a few meetings of businessmen and women in
the office of Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the board of trade, is a
mere public relations exercise. Interventionism is only real when it is
accompanied by a cheque. Mr Heseltine has no account on which to draw. In
short, Mr Major is not halting the Thatcher juggernaut. He is holding onto
it for dear life, coat-tails flying as it gathers speed.
Much of the force comes from the Treasury. The prime minister's single most
defining characteristic is that he is a Treasury apparatchik. Last year's
public spending plans were completed at a time when the administration was
deeply demoralised. There was no political capital to spend on deep cuts.
This year the attempt is being made once more, with the long-term spending
review. Easier said than done. As the mild-mannered secretary for social
security, Mr Peter Lilley, demonstrated on BBC Breakfast with Frost on
Sunday, his gargantuan social budget is extremely hard to trim. Mr Lilley,
like Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, is proudly of
the Tory right. The pair of them will either find ways of squeezing the
welfare state, or it will be Thatcher's heirs, not Mr Major, who failed.
