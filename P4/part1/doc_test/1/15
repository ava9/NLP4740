Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told Britain's Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher here Thursday that he is worried that the favorable momentum in 
East-West relations will be broken unless the Bush Administration responds more 
positively to Moscow's disarmament initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin leader apparently was reflecting growing Soviet impatience with 
what it sees as foot-dragging in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, who confirmed 
Gorbachev's statements, also accused U. S. officials of trying to sabotage the 
Anglo-Soviet summit by planting exaggerated news reports about Moscow's sale of 
advanced jet bombers to Libya. He said Moscow has supplied Libya with six 
Sukhoi-24 bombers under a three-year-old agreement -- not the 12 to 15 
warplanes claimed by Bush Administration officials on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters after the principal summit meeting between Thatcher and 
Gorbachev, Gerasimov commented: "The timing of this so-called news is very 
suspicious. I read about these sales months ago somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
His interpretation, he said, is that someone in Washington "doesn't want the 
Soviet-British summit to go as smoothly as it is going." 
</P>
<P>
The Libyan jet sale and other arms control issues were said to have generated 
the most disagreement during nearly six hours of intense discussions Thursday 
between two political leaders who have developed an extraordinary affinity 
despite standing on opposite sides of the ideological divide. 
</P>
<P>
The world's top Communist and the British Conservative his predecessors once 
dubbed "the Iron Lady" were sometimes "solemn," sometimes "passionate," as they 
defended their respective views forcefully, but without rancor, said a Thatcher 
spokesman who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister called the talks "very deep, very wide-ranging, and very 
friendly," while Gorbachev said the discussions "reached a very high level." 
</P>
<P>
While the British side played down Gorbachev's frustration with the Bush 
Administration, Gerasimov returned to the theme repeatedly during his meeting 
with correspondents. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, we are not happy with the West's response to our initiatives," he 
said. And he made it clear that Moscow blames Washington, as the leader of the 
Atlantic Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand the new Administration needs time to study foreign policy," 
Gerasimov commented icily. "There are new faces there, and some of them don't 
know what foreign policy is about." 
</P>
<P>
The superpowers have made important strides in arms control in the last two or 
three years, and the atmosphere for disarmament negotiations remains good, he 
said. However, "continuity is the name of the game. . . . The main point is not 
to lose this momentum with prolonged reviews of foreign policy or with other 
obstacles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His own analysis, Gerasimov said, is that "the new Administration tries to 
please everybody and it's not easy. Also, we can feel a certain influence of 
some familiar names -- (former Secretary of State Henry A.) Kissinger and 
(former National Security Adviser Zbigniew) Brzezinski -- who tend to interpret 
Soviet-American relations in terms of confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
"The new Administration is not yet decided which position to take -- how to 
interpret the international scene," Gerasimov charged. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Gorbachev wanted the British prime minister to intercede in 
Washington, Gerasimov said: "It's up to Mrs. Thatcher to follow up, to talk to 
the Americans. . . . We just expressed our concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Questioned about his Soviet counterpart's characterization, Thatcher's 
spokesman commented: "I suppose what they are reflecting is this transitional 
period" in Washington. As for anyone in the Bush Administration using the 
Libyan bomber issue to harm the Anglo-Soviet summit, he added, "I'm notoriously 
not in favor of conspiracy theories." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, the spokesman said, made passing reference to the Libyan bomber sale 
in her talks with Gorbachev, pointing out the danger of supplying weaponry to 
nations that support terrorism. Gorbachev reportedly made no response. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, meanwhile, the Israeli government expressed "deep concern" about 
the bomber deal and urged the Soviets to reconsider it, wire services said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 'Sharp Exchange' 
</P>
<P>
The issue also caused what British sources called a "sharp exchange" in 
parallel talks Thursday between British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and his 
Soviet counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who defended the deal as no 
different than British arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other Mideast clients. 
</P>
<P>
Given Thatcher's own views on arms control, meanwhile, it is debatable whether 
she would prod Bush into bolder action despite Soviet warnings about the danger 
of delay. 
</P>
<P>
Countering Gorbachev's calls for a nuclear-free Europe, Thatcher argued in an 
after-dinner toast that "both our countries know from bitter experience that 
conventional weapons do not deter war in Europe, whereas nuclear weapons have 
done so for over 40 years. As a deterrent, there is no substitute for them." 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov recounted that more than half the discussion in the two leaders' 
principal meeting Thursday was devoted to the Soviet domestic reform program, 
known as perestroika. He said Gorbachev "was extremely frank and talked not 
only about achievements, but also about all kinds of difficulties which we 
encounter." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever their other differences, on this score, the prime minister was totally 
supportive. "In barely more than four years since your first visit, we have 
seen changes in the Soviet Union which can only be described as a peaceful 
revolution," she said in her toast. "We admire -- very much admire -- the 
vision and the boldness which have inspired those changes." 
</P>
<P>
Human rights played little role in the day's discussions, although Thatcher did 
say at dinner that while Britain is pleased to see the emigration of those who 
want to leave the Soviet Union, "we also look forward to the changes in the law 
which you have promised, which will make these the rights of every person, so 
that they can be claimed and enforced and not given as privileges which can one 
day be taken away." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a few dozen supporters of Soviet Jews refused exit visas or Armenian 
activists demonstrated across Whitehall street from the prime minister's 
residence where the two leaders met. 
</P>
<P>
Underlining the special relationship between them, Thatcher hosted the Soviet 
leader in a study of her official residence at 10 Downing St., normally off 
limits for such meetings. The rapport between them is such that Gorbachev 
kidded her good-naturedly about the capacious handbag that some have dubbed 
Thatcher's secret weapon. "Ah! That's the handbag!" the Soviet leader said with 
a laugh when she reached into the bag for her index card at the start of 
Thursday's main meeting. 
</P>
<P>
To have more time with the Soviet leader, who heads back to Moscow today after 
only 40 hours in Britain, Thatcher has been riding with him in his armor-plated 
Zil limousine. 
</P>
<P>
At one point Thursday, after he paid a visit to Westminster Abbey, Gorbachev 
ordered his car to stop so he could get out and cross the street to shake hands 
with British well-wishers. "I would like to thank you all for this reception," 
he told them. 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to make a major speech here this morning before lunching with 
Queen Elizabeth II and returning to Moscow.
