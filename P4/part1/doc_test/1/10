FT  19 JUL 93 / Observer: Doctor abroad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of life's joys that ended with Margaret Thatcher's premiership was that
of asking Oxford dons whether they yet knew how the Iron Lady was going to
punish them for publicly denying her an honorary doctorate. After all, given
her character, they could not feel safe from retribution until she was
deposed nearly six years later.
But any resentment she may harbour will probably be dispelled this week. For
what her own alma mater denied her in early 1985 will be granted her in
Moscow on Thursday by the Mendeleev University, one of the former Soviet
Union's top research institutes.
She will combine the ceremony with a visit to someone else with cause to
smile ruefully at St Matthew's reminder about prophets being not without
honour save in their own country: ex-president Mikhail Gorbachev.
As Lady Thatcher did at Oxford, the Mendeleev specialises in chemistry.
Moreover, of the mere half dozen foreigners it has granted honorary degrees,
she is the only one who gave up chemistry for other things.
Why the award - did the Oxford snub have anything to do with it? 'I've heard
about that, but it doesn't touch on our decision,' says Dean Pavel Sarkisov.
'We have our own reasons.
'First, she was a chemist by education . . . second, she was a minister of
science and education . . . and third, and most important, she did so much
to advance and develop democracy in this country.'
