  [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government 
said on Friday Japan should take a proper action in connection 
with Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's recent remarks on Japan's 
role during World War II regardless of his retraction of the 
remarks Friday. 
  Nagano was reported to have apologized over and retracted 
his 
controversial remarks, saying, "My recent remarks about the past 
history were not appropriate ... I am retracting the statement 
in its entirety." 
  The Japanese minister earlier said Japan fought during World 
War II to "liberate Asian colonies from Europe" and the massacre 
said to have been committed by the Japanese Army in Nanjing, 
China was a "hoax." 
  A Seoul Government official said in a comment that "we can 
hardly regard Nagano's retraction as having completely rectified 
the distorted view of past history on the part of an incumbent 
Japanese cabinet member." 
  "We expect the Japanese Government to make an official 
clarification and take a proper action as Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu asked Tokyo earlier in the day," the official said. 
  Press reports from Tokyo indicated that in a press 
conference 
in Tokyo Nagano regretted it that his remarks set off public 
uproars in South Korea, China and some other relevant countries. 
  Stating he was feeling responsible for his remarks, Nagano 
said that he would leave the issue of whether he would resign as 
justice minister to the judgement of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.
