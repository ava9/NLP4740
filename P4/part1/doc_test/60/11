  [Text] Seoul, May 6 (XINHUA) -- South Korea today urged 
Japan to clarify its justice minister's remarks related to World 
War II and take "appropriate" action. 
  It was nothing short of "throwing cold water on efforts by 
both countries to improve South Korea-Japanese relations for an 
incumbent cabinet minister to make such remarks," South Korean 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu told Japanese Ambassador Goto 
Toshio in a meeting here. 
  In an interview with the Japanese national newspaper 
MAINICHI 
Tuesday [2 May], Shigeto Nagano, Japan's newly-appointed justice 
minister, claimed that his country wanted to liberate Asian 
colonies from European imperialism during World War II. 
  He also dismissed the "rape of Nanjing," in which Japanese 
soldiers killed some 300,000 Chinese civilians in 1937, as "a 
hoax." 
  Nagano's remarks immediately raised anger in South Korea, a 
victim of three decades of Japanese colonial rule before its 
liberation at the end of World War II. 
  Han said Nagano's remarks have greatly shocked the South 
Korean Government and people. He added, "Such distorted 
historical perspective is very regrettable." 
  Demanding action on the incident, the South Korean foreign 
minister said that Tokyo should take "appropriate measures" for 
Nagano's remarks. 
  However, former Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
who 
left office last week, called World War II "a war of aggression" 
and said it was wrong. 
  On Wednesday, new Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
described as "inappropriate" the remarks made by his justice 
minister about the killing of an estimated 300,000 Chinese 
civilians by Japanese troops. 
  "My view on the past history is that our past actions, 
including aggression and colonial rule, caused unbearable 
suffering and sorrow for many people," Hata said in a brief 
statement shortly after arriving in France for a two-day 
official visit.
