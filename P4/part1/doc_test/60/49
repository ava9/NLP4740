  [Text] Tokyo, May 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Sunday [8 May] admitted his responsibility for the 
resignation of former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano over his 
controversial remarks that the 1937 Nanjing massacre was a 
fabrication. 
  After he replaced Nagano with Hiroshi Nakai of the 
Democratic 
Socialist Party, Hata told reporters, "As a matter of fact, I am 
responsible (for his resignation) as the person who appointed 
him (as justice minister)." However, he added that he would 
like to show his responsibility by his own actions and efforts 
in preventing a war. 
  Opposition parties are reportedly ready to question his 
responsibility over Nagano's remarks at Diet deliberations which 
start Monday. 
  Hata said he anticipated such Diet deliberations on his 
responsibility, but added, "It is not bad to discuss these 
matters." 
  The premier said it is not fruitless if Diet deliberations 
will help unify a historic view of the Japanese people. 
  The prime minister also said he expects tough Diet going 
because his cabinet started as a minority government. He cited 
an early Diet passage of the government-proposed 1994 draft 
budget as the government's responsibility in the international 
community, considering Japan's current status in the world.
