  [Text] Beijing, May 8 KYODO -- Some two dozen Chinese 
wartime victims will start besieging the Japanese Embassy in 
Beijing with telephone calls for five days from Monday to 
protest former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's denial of the 
1937 Nanjing massacre, Chinese sources said Sunday [8 May]. 
  The sources said the angry Chinese are not satisfied with 
Nagano's resignation and are demanding an official apology from 
the Japanese Government. 
  The Chinese are also seeking a specific guarantee from Tokyo 
to avoid a repetition of such remarks questioning Japan's 
wartime aggression, the sources said. 
  The sources said the war victims have decided to employ the 
telephone tactic because it is difficult for Chinese to stage 
demonstrations. 
  The sources were alluding to the arrests of over 100 Chinese 
for trying to demonstrate near the Japanese Embassy at the time 
of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to Beijing in 
March.
