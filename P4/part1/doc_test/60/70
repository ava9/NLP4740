  [Text] Justice Minister Nagano has said that the Nanjing 
atrocity is a fabrication and South Korea and China are reacting 
against his remarks. 
  South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu called in 
Japanese 
Ambassador to Seoul Toshio Goto today to protest against 
Nagano's remarks. During his meeting with the Japanese 
ambassador, Foreign Minister Han said: We regret Justice 
Minister Nagano's remarks which have thrown cold water on new 
efforts by the South Korean and Japanese Governments to build a 
new relationship. I hope the Japanese Government will take 
proper steps to deal with his remarks. 
  About 50 South Korean bereaved family members of victims of 
the Pacific war assembled today in front of the Japanese Embassy 
in Seoul to throw eggs into the embassy building and demand the 
sacking of Justice Minister Nagano. 
  Meanwhile, the Chinese Government is believed to be 
assessing 
to some extent Justice Minister Nagano's retraction of his 
remarks that the Nanjing atrocity is a fabrication. So far, 
however, some Japanese cabinet ministers have denied Japan's war 
of aggression against China and the atrocity perpetrated by 
Japanese soldiers in China. Therefore, the Chinese Government is 
expected to carefully watch how the Japanese Government will 
deal with Nagano's remarks. 
  South Korean and Chinese Governments are asking the Japanese 
Government to take proper steps to deal with the controversial 
remarks through Japanese embassies in Seoul and Beijing. In 
response, Foreign Ministry spokesman Terada has said that the 
Japanese Government intends to respond to the South Korean and 
Chinese Governments through diplomatic channels about how the 
Japanese Government plans to deal with the controversial remarks 
after Prime Minister Hata returns home tomorrow.
