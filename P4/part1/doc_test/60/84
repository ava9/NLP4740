  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Chinese Foreign Trade and 
Economic Minister Wu Yi on Thursday [2 Jun] asked Japan to 
exercise prudence in taking a unilateral measure to curb textile 
imports from China. 
  Meeting Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister 
Eijiro Hata in Tokyo, Wu said, "China is concerned about Japan's 
invocation of a discriminatory curb on textile imports," 
according to ministry officials. 
  "Beijing cannot accept such a step," Wu was quoted as 
saying. 
  The Chinese trade minister was referring to a set of rules 
recently worked out by a Japanese Government panel for 
activating a safeguard measure on textile imports under the 
multifiber agreement (MFA). 
  The rules are designed to protect the Japanese textile 
industry from possible damage following massive textile imports, 
especially from China. 
  Japanese trade minister Hata said Tokyo is prepared to 
discuss the issue with China on a working-level. 
  Wu said China will strive to make its textile exports 
orderly, the officials told reporters. 
  The remark hints at Beijing's preparedness to introduce a 
voluntary curb on textile exports to Japan in order to prevent 
Japanese invocation of the safeguard measure. 
  During the one-hour meeting, Wu requested that Japan map out 
a framework for its fourth yen-loan program for China, the 
ministry officials said. 
  Hata replied that Japan will work out specifics of 60 
projects being selected under the five-year lending program from 
1996 "as early as possible," they said. 
  Hata was quoted as saying Japan will support China's early 
admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
But there remain various problems to clear the way for 
Beijing's smooth entry to GATT, including China's quantitative 
import restrictions, dual pricing systems and inconsistent 
enforcement of administrative rules between the central 
government and local governments, Hata said. 
  "China should reform these domestic systems so that its 
economy can be incorporated into the global economic system at 
an early time," he said. 
  Wu arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday for an eight-day visit to 
Japan aimed at encouraging Japanese investment in China. She is 
the first Chinese cabinet minister to visit Japan since the 
government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was formed in late 
April.
