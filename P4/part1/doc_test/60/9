  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
met here today with Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamed Mahathir 
and they both agreed on seeking a peaceful solution to the issue 
of the Nansha [Spratly] Islands based on friendly cooperation. 
  Li extended a welcome to his Malaysian counterpart on his 
working visit to China and attendance of the 1994 China summit 
meeting, a high-profile economic forum which ended here today. 
  During the meeting, both leaders expressed their willingness 
to further bilateral relations, which have seen full and speedy 
growth since the two countries established diplomatic ties 20 
years ago. 
  The Chinese premier said that after the cold war, the world 
has been developing in the direction of multi-polarization, 
which he believes is a positive trend; but on the other hand, 
there still remain many contradictions and problems to address. 
  Li said that world affairs should be jointly managed by all 
countries and that there is no room for power politics on the 
earth. 
  He said that all countries, big or small, rich or poor, 
strong or weak, should be treated equally, and disputes between 
nations should be settled through peaceful consultations and 
dialogues. 
  A just and rational world political and economic order 
should 
be set up, Li said, and the United Nations should do more for 
developing countries. 
  On the remarks made by former Japanese Minister of Justice 
Shigeta Nagano, in which Nagano distorted the history of Japan's 
aggression against China, Li said, the facts show that there is 
a force in Japan which attempts to distort and even beautify its 
aggression in history, which will surely be condemned by its 
Asian victims. 
  He said that the Hata government has taken a series of 
measures and delivered various speeches following Nagano's 
remarks. 
  A message from Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was later 
conveyed 
to Chinese Premier Li Peng promising that history shall be 
treated correctly and the younger generation shall be educated 
from a correct historical perspective. 
  The Chinese premier said he appreciated the profound 
introspection expressed by Prime Minister Hata over Japan's 
aggression and colonial rule. 
  On the Nansha Islands issue, Li said China will discuss the 
matter with Malaysia based on the principle of putting aside 
disputes and seeking joint exploration as proposed by Chinese 
leader Deng Xiaoping. 
  Mahathir said Malaysia very much appreciates China's stand 
of 
peaceful settlement of the Nansha issue and opposed an 
internationalization of the Nansha issue. 
  Both China and Malaysia are developing countries, he said, 
so 
they share many common points in dealing with both regional and 
international affairs. 
  On democracy, the Malaysian prime minister said, the 
concrete 
situation in different countries should be respected when 
talking about the issue of democracy, and it is not agreeable to 
apply the same concept of democracy to all countries in 
different stages of development.
