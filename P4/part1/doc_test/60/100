Mr Shigeto Nagano, Japan's justice minister, yesterday withdrew his claim
that an infamous Japanese atrocity never happened. But his unconvincing
retraction prompted fresh calls for his resignation.
Mr Nagano's claim, that the 1937 massacre of Nanking was a fabrication, has
angered China, South Korea, and other neighbours, throwing a shadow over
Japan's recent statements of regret for the war. The massacre was an
'undeniable fact' said Mr Nagano yesterday, in a stilted apology, restricted
to the wording of an earlier government statement.
He even failed to impress his own coalition ally, Komeito, the clean
government party. Mr Yuichi Ichikawa, Komeito's secretary general, said this
'does not release him from the need to take the responsibility as a cabinet
minister'. The Social Democratic party, Japan's second largest opposition
group, said the retraction did not end the matter and he should step down.
China yesterday sought to calm the row when President Jiang Zemin told a
visiting Japanese politician that he wanted to develop friendship with Tokyo
'while keeping in mind the past as an admonition for the future', said
officials.
However, the South Korean foreign ministry summoned the Japanese ambassador,
to ask Tokyo to explain its position on Japan's war record. A war victims'
association burned an effigy of Mr Nagano outside Japan's Seoul embassy, and
demanded his resignation.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the new prime minister, is understood to be furious over Mr
Nagano's remarks and the diplomatic damage they have caused.
