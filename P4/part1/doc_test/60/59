  [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- The new justice minister 
of the Japanese Government, Shigeto Nagano, contended that "it 
is wrong to say the Pacific War was a war of aggression" and the 
purpose of the war lay in "liberating colonies and establishing 
the greater East Asia coprosperity sphere." 
  Commenting on his remarks, NODONG SINMUN today brands this 
as 
a crude distortion of history and an intolerable insult to the 
Asian peoples who underwent terrible misfortunes and sufferings 
due to the aggression by the Japanese imperialists. 
  The analyst says: 
  Nagano's remarks represent the view of the Hata cabinet on 
the war of aggression in the past and reveal the reactionary and 
aggressive nature of the Japanese Government. And this tells us 
that the Japanese Government has wholly taken over the mode of 
thinking of the predecessors who started the war of aggression 
in the past and it is standing on the extention line of the war 
cabinet of imperialism of the bygone days ideologically and 
mentally. 
  Openly crying for the institution of "A Law on the Case of 
Emergency" almost everyday, the Hata cabinet is trying to easily 
mobilize manpower and material resources in a war of aggression 
by establishing "an emergency system" and a "wartime 
mobilisation system". 
  By attempting to justify the past war of aggression as "a 
war 
of liberation" Nagano sought to establish an ideological and 
political logic favorable for the policy of the militarists 
staging a comeback to Asia. 
  His description of the past war of aggression as "a war of 
justice" for "the greater East Asia coprosperity sphere" 
discloses the wild design of the militarist reactionaries to 
revive the old order of colonial domination in which Japan 
behaved like the master in Asia. 
  It is a shame of the Japanese people that such a fellow as 
Nagano is holding an important post in the Japanese cabinet. 
  If Japan again take the road of aggression and war, failing 
to draw a lesson from its defeat in the past, it will suffer a 
more miserable defeat.
