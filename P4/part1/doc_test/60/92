  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata today dispelled concerns that Tokyo may move toward 
active overseas military deployments. 
  Hata told a plenary session of the House of Representatives 
that Japan's Constitution prohibits the country's involvement in 
collective security and that he has no intention of changing the 
conventional interpretation of the constitution on this issue. 
  This was in response to a question from Yohei Kono, 
president 
of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party. 
  The prime minister's remarks were apparently designed to 
ease 
apprehension among opposition legislators that his 
administration is moving toward more active involvement by 
Japan's Self-Defense Forces in international conflicts. 
  Hata also denied that Japan had secretly agreed with the 
United States in 1969 to allow Washington to deploy nuclear arms 
on Okinawa island to defend Japan and America's other Asian 
allies. 
  He was referring to a recent allegation in a book written by 
Kei Wakaizumi, former special emissary of then Prime Minister 
Cisaku Sato, that Sato and Nixon signed a top-secret memorandum 
at the White House on November 21, 1969, saying that Japan is 
aware of U.S. expectations for a favorable response to possible 
U.S. requests to deploy nuclear weapons on Okinawa in times of 
crisis.
