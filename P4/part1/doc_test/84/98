THOUGH NOT as bitchy as academics, members of the foreign policy
establishment in the US - and elsewhere - can be pretty sniffy when an
outsider gets a position that really matters.
Even today, any recollection of the freelance thoughts and activities of Mr
Andrew Young, UN ambassador in the Carter administration of the 1970s,
produces pained expressions among them.
President Bill Clinton brings no credentials other than intellect to the
practice of US foreign policy. But the team now mostly assembled to run it
for him, under the aegis of Mr Warren Christopher as secretary of state,
should flutter few diplomatic dovecotes.
It is certainly not short of experience, even though the Democrats have been
out of power for 12 years. It has continuity in the retention of some senior
Bushmen, with Mr Edward Djerejian and Mr Dennis Ross remaining involved in
the Middle East and Mr Bernard Aronson temporarily keeping the Latin
American brief, mostly to deal with Haiti.
The team is well stuffed with career diplomats, including those held over,
even though some had moved out to the private sector. Mr Sam Lewis,
ambassador to Israel for eight years under Presidents Carter and Bush,
returns to run policy planning.
Mr Winston Lord, once an associate of Mr Henry Kissinger and who was
ambassador to Beijing until a few months before the Tiananmen Square
massacre in 1989, comes back to take control of Asian affairs. Mr George
Moose, another professional diplomat and former envoy to Senegal, gets the
African brief.
It has a quota of outsiders. Ever since he was passed over for a cabinet
post last month, Mr Tim Wirth, former senator from Colorado, has seemed a
likely recruit.
He is a man of eclectic interests and popular in Washington. His new role as
counsellor in charge of a fistful of global issues, ranging from the
environment to refugees, ought to test his talents.
Likewise, Mr Strobe Talbott, the Time magazine journalist and Oxford
classmate of Mr Clinton, has spent much of his career writing about the
former Soviet Union, including a book soon to be published. This knowledge
will be deployed in another new position as ambassador-at-large to the
former Soviet republics, with particular emphasis on Russia.
Mr Christopher has also placed those he knows particularly well in key
places - such as Mr Peter Tarnoff of the Council on Foreign Relations who,
as political under-secretary, is number three in the state department; Mr
Thomas Donilon, an associate with the secretary of state's law firm who
takes over public affairs; and Mr Stephen Oxman, now an investment banker
but aide to Mr Christopher in the Carter administration, who gets the
European portfolio.
There are, however, three areas of potential controversy. Mr Lord, a
Republican, has been very critical of China's post-Tiananmen policies. A
mid-summer test of the new administration's approach to China will occur
when Congress considers extension of most-favoured nation trading status. Mr
Lord might well propose that this be more conditional on acceptable Chinese
behaviour.
There appears to be a fair-sized battle going on over the succession to Mr
Aronson for Latin America. Favourite for the job was Mr Mario Baeza, a black
Cuban-American lawyer from New York and a close friend of Mr Vernon Jordan,
director of the administrative transition.
However, opposition to his appointment has come from Mr Jorge Mas Canosa,
leader of the Cuban community in Florida, who is reported to suspect Mr
Baeza would be more inclined to promote a dialogue with President Fidel
Castro of Cuba than work to overthrow him.
Last - but by no means least for Washington insiders - the absence of any of
the neo-conservative coterie influential in the foreign policy debate has
been widely noticed.
There remains the suspicion that most of the foreign policy ideas in the new
administration will come from the White House National Security Council
under Mr Anthony Lake and Mr Sandy Berger, with the State Department
providing the diplomatic process.
For all that, they all know each other well enough to avoid unnecessary
tensions.
