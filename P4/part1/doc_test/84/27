I suppose that I should not find it surprising that Reagan, whose 
Administration was involved in everything from illegal arms deals to supporting 
terrorists, is praising Nixon's record.

While the activities of the Nixon Administration may seem somewhat tame by 
comparison, that makes them no less repugnant. Perhaps we are as a nation 
forgetting what responsible leadership means to such an extent that someday the 
appalling actions of Nixon will seem commonplace, and historians will indeed 
praise his achievements. However, if there is any justice (or indeed morality) 
in the world, it will be the moral failing of the Reagan Administration that 
will be recognized, not the dubious successes of the Nixon Administration.
