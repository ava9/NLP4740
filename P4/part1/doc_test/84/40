The question is one that inevitably confronts all White House press 
secretaries: What do you do, as NBC news commentator John Chancellor delicately 
put it Friday to 10 men who have held the job, when circumstances -- be they 
national security or simply presidential preference -- demand that you "shade 
the truth"? 
</P>
<P>
"I lied," shot back Jody Powell, former President Carter's press secretary. 
"And worse than that, I don't have any regrets about it." 
</P>
<P>
As was made clear at the opening session of a two-day symposium at UC San Diego 
that features an unprecedented gathering of White House press secretaries from 
six past administrations, Powell was not the only presidential spokesman who 
occasionally opted for loyalty to his boss over fidelity to the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Blending colorful White House press room war stories with insightful theories 
forged from experience, the men, who served presidents from John Kennedy 
through Ronald Reagan, delighted a crowd of about 500 with recollections of the 
times they bent, if not broke, the truth and insider tales of their successful 
-- and failed -- attempts at image management. Moderated by Chancellor, the 2 
1/2-hour program was broadcast in San Diego Friday night and is scheduled to be 
aired nationwide on public television this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the press secretaries conceded that the parameters of their 
high-visibility, high-pressure job were shaped largely by the personalities and 
policies of the presidents they served. Forced to mold with the clay at their 
disposal, the press secretaries, recognizing the futility of attempting a total 
remake of their bosses' images, said they were instead guided daily by a more 
modest though no less significant public-relations goal: consistently 
accentuating the positive while trying to minimize the negative. 
</P>
<P>
Often, those efforts had humorous overtones. For example, President Ford's 
advisers, sensitive over his reputation for klutziness, permitted no photos of 
the President with the national turkey at Thanksgiving -- "for obvious 
reasons," his press secretary, Ron Nessen, wryly noted. 
</P>
<P>
President Nixon's aides received a lesson in the potential pitfalls of image 
shaping when they decided that photos of him strolling along the beach at San 
Clemente would help soften his rigid, imperial image. That plan, however, 
backfired when the resulting pictures showed Nixon walking in the sand in his 
black Bostonian shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"That was our last attempt to deal with that situation," Nixon press secretary 
Ron Ziegler said, amid loud laughter. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the former White House spokesmen acknowledged that they occasionally 
misled the press -- and, consequently, the public -- either intentionally or 
inadvertently. Frequently, such deceptions were spawned by national security 
considerations, as when Powell denied to a reporter that the Carter 
Administration was planning the ultimately unsuccessful "Desert One" rescue 
attempt of the Iranian hostages, even though he knew that such plans were in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
George Reedy, one of Lyndon Johnson's three White House spokesmen, pointed out 
that the Administration consistently denied having U.S. bases in Thailand 
during the Vietnam War -- even though the bases' existence was common knowledge 
in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a secret for anybody except the American people who footed the 
bill," Reedy said. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan spokesman Larry Speakes also misled reporters about another military 
operation -- the planned invasion of Grenada -- but only because he himself had 
been misled by a Reagan national security adviser, who told him that the idea 
was "preposterous." The invasion occurred the day after Speakes passed along 
that denial to the press. 
</P>
<P>
"That taught me that, if you ask, 'Are we going to invade Grenada today?' and 
they say, 'No,' don't forget about tomorrow morning," Speakes said. 
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, however, Speakes was the architect of one of the 
best-known examples of deception by a presidential press secretary in recent 
history, when he admitted that he fabricated quotes that he attributed to 
Reagan when the President met Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev for the first 
time. His motivation, Speakes explained, was his concern that Reagan, who, on 
the advice of his staff, sat silent while photographers snapped photos of the 
two leaders, might be eclipsed by Gorbachev's expansive remarks to reporters. 
Hoping to capture the historic tenor of the summit, Speakes told reporters that 
Reagan had said, "The world rests easier because we're meeting here today." 
</P>
<P>
"It retrospect, it was the wrong thing to do," Speakes said, even while noting 
that speeches and comments written by others frequently are attributed to the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
Prefers Honesty 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy press secretary Pierre Salinger suggested that, rather than lie to the 
press, it is better to be honest and then, if necessary, appeal to reporters or 
editors to withhold information that could jeopardize lives or American 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
He successfully used that approach, he said, shortly after Kennedy became 
President when Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev privately offered to release 
several downed U.S. pilots -- but made it clear that any premature publicity 
would kill the deal. When confronted by a reporter, Salinger confirmed the 
details -- but won his assurance that the story would be held until the pilots 
were freed. 
</P>
<P>
If national security defines one end point of the spectrum in the explanations 
for White House press secretarial deceptions, the other end is marked by what 
Nessen described simply as "silly reasons." When Ford wanted to go to Florida 
primarily to play golf, for example, his aides had to "drum up a community 
meeting" as justification for the trip, Nessen said. 
</P>
<P>
When the press begins to focus on such stories -- usually inconsequential in 
substance, but deadly serious in terms of the public perceptions they foster or 
reinforce -- that often is indicative of deeper problems surrounding a 
presidency, the press secretaries agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the consensus Friday was that, aso long as domestic pocketbook issues 
and world affairs are in good shape, presidents are less likely to encounter -- 
and certainly are better equipped to weather -- press sniping about bumping 
their heads on helicopter doors or the like. Stories about Reagan's frequent 
factual inaccuracies at news conferences and hands-off management style became 
less common, they pointed out, when the recession that dominated his first 
several years in office receded. 
</P>
<P>
However, when growing problems cause a president's popularity to plummet, 
stories that could be shrugged off -- or might not even be reported otherwise 
-- begin to take hold, they said. Just as the Vietnam War eroded Johnson's 
credibility and increasingly made him fodder for the nation's stand-up comics, 
Watergate did the same for Nixon, while high inflation and the Iranian hostage 
dilemma undercut Carter's support. Amid such distractions, it becomes more 
difficult for a president to refocus the nation's attention on his agenda, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to be selecting patterns for next year's outfits when your pants are 
on fire," Carter spokesman Powell said. Indeed, the now-familiar story about 
Carter allegedly being attacked by a "killer rabbit" in the late 1970s 
reinforced skepticism about a president who had been seen by many as a bit 
quirky from the start. 
</P>
<P>
Human Elements 
</P>
<P>
Much of Friday's program was enlivened by the recitation of personal anecdotes 
that shed light on the human elements of being the spokesman for the most 
powerful office in the world -- stories alternately told with the 
matter-of-fact casualness of the insider's insider, or in a somewhat breathless 
now-it-can-be-told manner. 
</P>
<P>
Salinger told of the time, for example, when he mentioned to Kennedy that the 
White House was receiving complaints from women because most photos of the 
First Couple showed the President walking in front of his wife. "Tell Jackie to 
walk faster," was Kennedy's solution. 
</P>
<P>
James Brady, who was seriously wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on 
Reagan, joked about how Henry Kissinger tried to persuade Reagan that a few 
minor constitutional adjustments could easily produce a monarchy in this 
country -- with Kissinger as foreign minister. 
</P>
<P>
Technological advancements that make instantaneous worldwide communication 
possible, coupled with a growing tendency to view the President as, in 
Chancellor's words, "the be all and end all" of virtually all news, have 
confronted recent press secretaries with new challenges. 
</P>
<P>
The incessant demands for the President's response to any and all world events 
also is one of the primary differences between the presidential press 
secretaries' job and that of a typical public-relations officer. Although the 
latter can carefully limit his client's public comments, a White House press 
secretary does not have that luxury. Underlining that point, Chancellor noted 
that, when Pope John Paul II was shot, medical bulletins on his condition were 
released from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
But the press, too, has contributed to the perception of the White House as a 
kind of worldwide information vortex, the press secretaries said. As Ford 
spokesman Nessen stressed, TV reporters are more likely to be videotaped in 
front of the White House than the Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
"An explosion of journalism in this century has tipped the scales against the 
President," Johnson spokesman Bill Moyers said. 
</P>
<P>
High Marks for Bush 
</P>
<P>
Most of the participants in Friday's symposium gave high marks to President 
Bush's relationship with the press. In particular, they credited him with, in 
Salinger's words, "eliminating shouting journalism" by granting reporters 
dramatically greater access than they had to Reagan -- whose contact with the 
press often was limited to reporters' questions yelled over the noise of the 
rotor blades of the presidential helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
In reviewing how the presidential press secretary's job has evolved over the 
past three decades, most of the former White House spokesmen argued, if not for 
a greater policy role for the press secretary, at least for enhanced access to 
policy-making discussions. Some of the major public-relations disasters faced 
by each during his White House years stemmed from the absence of such access, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
Even Salinger, who had unlimited access to the Oval Office, said he learned of 
the Bay of Pigs invasion only three hours before it occurred. Jerald terHorst 
learned of Ford's plan to pardon Nixon for any alleged Watergate-related crimes 
the night before that happened -- and then only because he was given the 
ticklish job of telling reporters to be at the White House on a Sunday morning 
without telling them why. 
</P>
<P>
Using the controversy over the Nixon pardon as a backdrop, moderator Chancellor 
asked the press secretaries how they reacted when they personally disagreed 
with the president. In terHorst's case, he felt so adamantly opposed to the 
pardon that he resigned after only about one month on the job -- earning him a 
place, he joked, in the Guinness Book of Records for the shortest term as White 
House press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, argued that their primary job is simply to accurately convey 
the President's viewpoint, regardless of whether they concur with it. Their 
personal opinion, in fact, is of little consequence, several said. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us have been asked . . . whether we agree with what the President has 
just done," Nessen said. "My answer is, 'Who cares?' " 
</P>
<P>
But surely there must have been times, Chancellor prodded -- glancing at 
Ziegler -- when you went home at night and told your wives that "this president 
is a real dope and he's going to get killed" if he doesn't change his policies. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, particularly in the last year and a half," the former Nixon spokesman 
deadpanned. "On a regular basis."
