TURMOIL AND TRIUMPH: My Years as Secretary of State
By George P Shultz Scribners, Pounds 25.95, 1,184 pages
In July 1982, George Shultz assumed office as US secretary of state. Leonid
Brezhnev was then general secretary of the Soviet Communist party. Following
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the crackdown on Solidarity
in Poland in 1981, US-Soviet relations were virtually non-existent.
Moreover, the Soviet Union was on the diplomatic offensive, trying to split
Nato over deployment of intermediate range nuclear missiles on European
soil. And many were questioning the market model for economic development.
But when Shultz left office in January 1989 the opening of the Berlin Wall
was only months in the future.
In Turmoil and Triumph: My Years as Secretary of State, Shultz provides an
indispensable account covering, occasionally to the point of tedium, those
aspects of American foreign policy with which he concerned himself. It is
illustrative of how the approach of the US has changed that Shultz, a former
Treasury secretary and professional economist, appears virtually to have
ignored the economic aspects of international relations.
There is an ongoing debate among commentators and scholars about whether the
Reagan administration stepped up military spending in order to drive the
Soviet Union to bankruptcy. But there is no indication of such a plan in
Shultz's memoirs. Indeed, Shultz and the CIA believed an unrestrained
arms-race would favour the Soviets.
Because Shultz is writing of the end of the cold war, his treatment has been
compared with the magisterial account of the beginning of that struggle by
Dean Acheson, the most influential secretary of state since the second world
war. But the comparison with Acheson's Present At The Creation is unfair to
Shultz. For, although his writing is serviceable, Shultz is unable to match
the style and sense of drama of his predecessor.
During Acheson's period, the US had to develop a wholly new strategy to deal
with an expanding superpower. The response included the doctrine of
containment, the Marshall Plan and Nato. Shultz dealt with a simpler
situation - negotiating the end of a conflict with a declining superpower.
Shultz was required not to be creative but to show mastery over competing US
agency heads. Once Acheson received Truman's backing, the inter-agency
struggle was over. But Reagan's support did not settle a dispute; rival
barons would continue their obstruction.
In Shultz's portrayal, the chiefs of the various agencies concerned with
foreign affairs were, usually, dishonest, cut off from reality, or both.
William Casey's CIA was, justifiably, distrusted by Shultz because of its
ideological blindness, outright lying and lack of competence. The agency
insisted Gorbachev did not want to change the Soviet Union or that, if he
did, he could not. The national security adviser, William Clark, is
dismissed as having a limited grasp of substance. His successors - first
Robert McFarlane, then John Poindexter - are described as having
intentionally misled the secretary of state. Caspar Weinberger, secretary of
defence, generally opposed all negotiations with the Soviet Union.
Contrary to CIA analyses, Shultz believed the Soviet Union was declining and
that negotiations with it could be fruitful. The National Security Council
staff's answer to the question of contacts with the Soviet Union was 'ever a
resounding no'. Shultz considered the president 'a prisoner of his own
staff'. Yet Shultz obtained the president's approval for moving forward -
over the opposition of that staff, the secretary of de-fence and the
director of the CIA.
Shultz tempers loyalty to his president with fidelity to the facts. He
praises Reagan's 'visionary ideas', such as the strategic defence
initiative, but he reveals a detached president, devoid of analytical
ability, who believed what he wanted to believe. 'He would go over the
'script' of an event in his mind' and, once that script was mastered, that
was the truth; no fact, no argument, no plea for reconsideration could
change his mind.
A large portion of Shultz's account focuses on the Iran-Contra affair. Here,
Shultz is entitled to, and claims, a great deal of credit. There is no doubt
he opposed arms for hostages. Almost alone among the president's men, he
recognised there had been a 'rogue operation' which posed 'an immense
constitutional threat'. Nonetheless, a detailed review in the New York
Review of Books concluded that Shultz's account of Iran-Contra was
hopelessly 'distorted' and 'untrustworthy'.
Charles Hill, Shultz's former executive assistant, in what was surely an
authorised response, asserted the reviewer failed to understand 'that Shultz
confined his narrative to what he knew or was told at the time and excludes
information or any evidence which came to light after a decision or event
occurred'. According to Hill, this makes Turmoil and Triumph 'a unique,
irreplaceable and unchallengeable historical document, as it reveals a
reality that 'memoirs' invariably obscure: decisions of statecraft must be
taken on the basis of partial and sometimes erroneous reports'.
But the book gives no indication that it is confined to what Shultz was
aware of at any given time. If Mr Hill is correct on Shultz's approach, the
reader has not been given fair warning that Shultz's account of external
events may or may not be accurate.
On many occasions Shultz threatened to resign in response to the
manoeuvrings and inadequacies of colleagues. But he resisted this grand
gesture. We can be grateful that he soldiered on. His judgment was much
needed.
The author is a lawyer in Washington who served on the National Security
Council staff in the Johnson and Nixon administrations
