THE Federal Bureau of Investigation has launched a probe into possible
misconduct by senior Bush administration officials.
The investigation follows admissions that US intelligence information about
Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.8bn) of militarily useful loans to Iraq was
deliberately concealed from a federal court.
These loans, made by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro, have been at the centre of a long-running scandal in which the Bush
administration has been accused in Congress of covering up its own knowledge
and involvement in the illegal financial transactions.
Late last week Central Intelligence Agency and Department of Justice
officials admitted in closed Senate testimony that intelligence reports on
BNL had been withheld from a US court.
The FBI probe, requested by Mr William Barr, the US attorney-general, came
as officials of the CIA and Department of Justice engaged in an unusual
slanging match about which agency had acted to withhold CIA reports from
Judge Marvin Shoob, the federal judge who has presided over the BNL case.
Mr Dan Levin, a Justice Department spokesman, said the FBI would investigate
whether information had been withheld and whether there had been any
misconduct by senior Bush administration officials.
A substantial part of the BNL loans, including some that were guaranteed by
the US government, financed Iraqi nuclear, chemical weapons and ballistic
missile projects.
Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, said last week
that a special prosecutor should be named to investigate the BNL case.
Senator David Boren, chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said at
the weekend that testimony from CIA and Justice Department officials had
created 'very troubling' signs that both government agencies knew that a CIA
report on BNL issued last month was misleading.
The report examined whether the agency had any knowledge of the involvement
of BNL's head office in Rome. It claimed that the CIA had only heard of
Rome's involvement from 'publicly available sources'.
However, the report was immediately contradicted by the disclosure in
Congress of another classified CIA report.
Both the CIA and Justice Department yesterday denied their officials had
deliberately misled Congress or the court. But a Senate official who was
present during the testimony confirmed these admissions were made.
Mr Robert Mueller, the assistant attorney-general, acknowledged that he had
personally rejected an attempt by the CIA to issue a clarifying statement.
'The reason why I did not believe it should be published was that it did not
resolve the conflict between the conclusion of the underlying (CIA) summary
and the document on which it was purportedly based.'
Mr Mueller said that while he tried to resolve the discrepancy, 'I never got
an adequate response from the CIA.'
