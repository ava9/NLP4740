A jury in Painesville, Ohio, recommended that cult leader Jeffrey Don Lundgren, 
40, be put to death for killing a family of five in a cult ritual. 
</P>
<P>
He was convicted Aug. 29 of the 1989 slayings of the Dennis Avery family, which 
included children ages 15, 13 and 6. The bodies were uncovered in a Kirtland 
barn after a cult member notified authorities. A Lake County judge is to 
sentence Lundgren today. Lundgren had broken away from the Reorganized Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and took with him a following that 
believed he was a prophet chosen by God to lead the church.
