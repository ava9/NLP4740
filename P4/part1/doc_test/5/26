FT  21 JUL 93 / Clinton appoints judge to FBI helm

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday named Mr Louis Freeh as new director of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Mr Freeh, a former FBI agent and prosecutor and now a federal judge in New
York, was widely tipped for the job. He will replace Mr William Sessions,
who was fired by Mr Clinton earlier this week.
The appointment, which is subject to confirmation by the Senate, will
complete the Clinton administration's law enforcement line-up with a third
figure drawn from the field of big city criminal justice.
Although Mr Clinton's first choices for attorney-general were drawn from the
ranks of corporate law, Ms Janet Reno, now installed as the star of the
Clinton cabinet, was a criminal prosecutor in Miami. Mr Lee Brown, director
of drug control policy and another cabinet member, served as police chief in
Atlanta, Houston and New York.
Mr Freeh, whose record includes the break-up of the 'pizza connection'
heroin ring and the investigation of a series of letter bombs, has a
reputation as a tough law enforcement professional.
He faces the immediate task of restoring leadership at an agency whose
divisional heads have often been accused of acting as independent barons.
Mr Sessions' leadership had been impaired since a Justice Department report
in January accused him of abusing the perks of office, but it is widely
believed he never succeeded in taking the agency in hand.
The delay in appointing Ms Reno as attorney-general and in replacing Mr
Sessions at the head of the FBI has left the Clinton administration lagging
in crime policy.
Some politicians can scarcely believe Mr Clinton has not yet pushed for
action on his crime agenda, which they feel could provide him with the
relatively easy victory in Congress that has so regularly eluded him.
His campaign crime programme included proposals to put 100,000 more police
officers on the streets with the creation of a national police corps, to put
more money into community policing and drug treatment programmes, and to
pass gun control laws.
