WACOAL, a Japanese underwear maker, yesterday reported a sharp fall in
profits despite a rise in sales, due to lower margins and the cost of
redeeming warrant bonds.
Taxable profits fell 13.5 per cent to Y6.3bn (Dollars 50.8m) on a 4.3 per
cent rise in sales to Y66.2bn. Net profits fell 9.3 per cent to Y3bn.
Wacoal said its spring and autumn sale campaigns boosted sales of woman's
underwear by 6.2 per cent.
