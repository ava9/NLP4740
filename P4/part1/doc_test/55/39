<F P=106> ["They Sharpen Sword Behind Dialogue"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- The reckless war 
exercises such as "defence exercise against landing" staged by 
the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique behind the scene of dialogue show 
that they seek a way out only in confrontation and war, 
challenging the nation's desire for peace and peaceful 
reunification, declares NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The news analyst says: 
  If the puppets are interested in North-South dialogue and a 
peaceful settlement of the reunification question, they must 
refrain from war exercises against the dialogue partner. 
  Their continued play with fire, which is incompatible with 
dialogue, cannot be construed otherwise than a deliberate act to 
obstruct the working-level contact at Panmunjom and frustrate 
the exchange of special envoys. This is proved by the South 
Korean rulers' wrong dialogue stance toward the working-level 
contact. 
  By making the exchange abortive, they intend to put a spoke 
in the wheel of DPRK-U.S. talks, hinder the settlement of the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and slay fellow countrymen 
with the help of foreign sword. 
  The double-faced acts of the "civilian"-veiled warmaniacs, 
who sharpen the sword against fellow countrymen behind the scene 
of dialogue for the exchange of special envoys, are bound to 
face criticism at home and abroad. 
  The nation will never pardon the "civilian"-veiled 
warmaniacs 
who stick to confrontation at a time when the entire fellow 
countrymen are all out to achieve reunification in the 1990s 
through the unity of the nation.
