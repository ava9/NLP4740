<F P=106> ["DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Urges Repeal of `NSL' in </F>
S. Korea"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 8 (KCNA) -- If the North-South 
dialogue is to progress successfully and the peace and peaceful 
reunification of the Korean peninsula to be achieved, such 
fascist laws as the "National Security Law" [NSL] must be 
abolished without delay in South Korea, said a spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
today. 
  Answering a question put by KCNA about the controversy 
between the U.S. and South Korean authorities over the 
abrogation of the "NSL", the spokesman said: 
  Recently, the United States expressed its official position 
calling for the abolition of the "NSL" in South Korea. 
  Several days ago, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State 
Hubbard, speaking at a university of the United States, held 
that the "NSL" of South Korea must be scrapped. Afterwards, 
Secretary of State Christopher stated that this demand was not a 
person's view but an official position of the United States. 
  As well known the world, the "NSL" of South Korea is a 
fascist law that defines the North as an "anti-state 
organization" and prohibits free dialogue and exchange between 
the North and the South and is an offspring of the military 
dictatorship. 
  The successive military dictatorial regimes of South Korea 
have harshly suppressed South Korean people, fostered 
North-South confrontation and obstructed national reunification 
by invoking the anti-communist fascist laws such as the "NSL" 
under the patronage of the United States. 
  Those in the "civilian" regime in South Korea have trampled 
underfoot human rights and obstructed reunification and dialogue 
so recklessly that even high-placed officials of the United 
States called for the abrogation of the "NSL." 
  The Kim Yong-sam regime is branded as a "civilian fascist" 
regime because it keeps the "NSL" intact. And it is also due to 
the "NSL" that the multi-channel dialogues and exchange between 
the North and the South were foiled without progress in the past 
and many South Korean people were put into prison or killed for 
their demand for national reunification or visit to the North. 
  Such being the case, the "NSL" can be termed the second 
concrete wall, from the legal point of view, built with in South 
Korea by the South Korean authorities as high as their concrete 
wall running along the Military Demarcation Line. 
  The "NSL" should have been abolished when the agreement on 
reconciliation, nonaggression, cooperation and exchange between 
the North and the South was adopted and effectuated. 
  It is a good thing that the U.S. Administration called for 
the abolition of the "NSL", the biggest obstacle to the 
North-South relations, though belatedly. I think that the call 
came from its understanding that the "NSL" is one of the factors 
that impede the progress of the negotiation between the North 
and the South of Korea.
