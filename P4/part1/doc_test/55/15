  [Text] Pyongyang, February 20 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
comment on a "speech" on the "policy orientation" of the 
"Democratic Liberal Party" of South Korea by its Chairman Kim 
Chong-pil, the traitor. 
  NODONG SINMUN in a commentary brands the traitor Kim 
Chong-pil's malicious slander against the DPRK over the "nuclear 
issue" as an open challenge to the DPRK's sincere efforts for 
reconciliation, unity and dialogue and an unpardonable criminal 
act of trampling upon the desire of the fellow countrymen for 
reunification. 
  The analyst points out: 
  The South Korean puppets are the criminals who have created 
nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula by shipping nuclear 
weapons into South Korea and have stepped up their own nuclear 
armament. So they are not in a position to talk about the 
"nuclear issue" of the DPRK. 
  It is the height of impudence for the puppets to meddle in 
the problem that should be solved through negotiations between 
the DPRK and the United States and say this or that in this 
regard. 
  That day the traitor Kim cried over "armed provocation" by 
the North and raved that it should be checked. His outburst is 
a shameless act that reminds people of a thief crying "Stop 
Thief!" 
  By calling for "close cooperation with friendly countries," 
he meant, in essence, to slay fellow countrymen with the sword 
of outside forces. 
  It cannot be forgiven and overlooked that he cried the South 
"should not make haste with unification" and that it should 
"make full preparations for reunification by prevailing over the 
North". He revealed in this a heinous intention to keep the 
division for an indefinite period, dawdling away time and 
achieve "reunification by prevailing over communism" through a 
war, not a peaceful reunification. 
  The traitor Kim Chong-pil's outcries for "predominance over 
the North," revealing the scheme to delay reunification and his 
reiteration of the doctrine "unification by prevailing over 
communism" that is not possible any time are all unpardonable 
anti-national criminal acts, says the commentary. 
  MINJU CHOSON in a signed commentary says if the "Democratic 
Liberal Party" continues to bar national reunification with the 
outcries for "unification by prevailing over the North" and 
"unification by prevailing over communism" that are impossible, 
they will face a stern judgment by the people.
