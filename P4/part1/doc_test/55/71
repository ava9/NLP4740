  [Text] Pyongyang, January 20 (KCNA) -- The North 
headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon), the Committee for the Peaceful 
Reunification of the Fatherland (CPRF), the Central Committee of 
the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland 
(DFRF), the North headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth 
and Students for the Country's Reunification (Pomchonghaknyon) 
and the Central Committee of the Korean Christians Federation 
(KCF) today sent messages of condolence to the funeral committee 
of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a South Korean patriotic champion of 
national reunification. 
  The messages expressed deep condolences to the bereaved 
family and the members of the funeral committee over the death 
of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, who devotedly struggled for independence, 
democracy and reunification. 
  The CPRF said that though he passed away, the feats he 
performed for national reunification and his patriotic spirit 
would always remain in the memory of the Koreans in the North 
and the South struggling together for reunification in the `90s. 
  The C.C., DFRF expressed the belief that the South Korean 
people and students desirous of national reunification would 
turn their grief at the loss of a standardbearer of the movement 
for reunification and democracy into the will for reunification 
and invigorate the patriotic struggle for independence, 
democracy and reunification. 
  Former war correspondent of the Korean People's Army Yi 
In-mo, the incarnation of the faith and will, also sent a 
message of condolence to the bereaved family of Rev. Mun. 
  Recalling that Rev. Mun visited him in sickbed at the 
hospital of the Pusan University last year and told him that 
they would meet each other again after the reunification of the 
country, he expressed the hope that the desire for reunification 
cherished by Rev. Mun in his lifetime would be realised.
