<F P=106> ["Papers Call for Overthrow of Kim Yong-sam Traitorous </F>
Group" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 19 (KCNA) -- It is two years 
since documents of inter-Korean agreement were effectuated, but 
they have failed to bear fruit and have become sheets of waste 
paper today. 
  Papers here today say this is entirely because the 
"civilian"-veiled traitorous "government" of Kim Yong-sam has 
denied the principles of independence, peace and great national 
unity and obstructed their implementation on unreasonable 
grounds. 
  An analyst of NODONG SINMUN says: 
  The effectuation of the North-South agreement and the joint 
declaration on denuclearization was proclaimed at the sixth 
North-South high-level talks February 19, 1992. This was an 
epoch-making event which served as a landmark in-moving toward 
peace and reunification of the country. 
  Had both the North and the South fulfilled the documents of 
agreement, they would have been able to part with the past 
marred by distrust and confrontation, bring about a new epoch of 
reconciliation, remove the danger of war and open a bright 
horizon of peace and reunification of the country. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, however, pursued the policy 
of dependence on outside forces more zealously than its 
predecessors and resumed the Team Spirit joint military 
maneuvers with the United States under the pretext of "suspicion 
surrounding the nuclear development" of the North, the war game 
which had been suspended toward the end of the "Sixth Republic." 
This was tantamount to declaring its refusal of all dialogues 
and its overt nullification of the documents of agreement. 
  The puppet clique laid hurdles in the way of DPRK-U.S. talks 
and completely opened the rice market of South Korea, yielding 
to pressure from its U.S. master, though its predecessors had 
not dared to do so. 
  Although the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique cried for "reform" 
and "liquidation of the past" it has left intact the "National 
Security Law," the "Security Planning Board" and the "Secret 
Affairs Command," turning South Korea into a grave of human 
rights and democracy. It has broken up the dialogue and 
cooperation between the authorities of North and South which had 
been held in the period of the "Fifth and Sixth Republics" 
dictatorship and blocked nongovernmental dialogue and contact. 
  Since the traitor Kim Yong-sam took office in South Korea, 
the acts of flunkeyism, treachery, fascism, confrontation and 
war have become more undisguised and vicious, the people's 
desire for independence, democracy and reunification has been 
put down, the documents of agreement between the North and the 
South have been reduced to waste paper, dialogues have collapsed 
and the situation has become worse than in the days before the 
adoption of the North- South agreement. 
  As long as such traitor as Kim Yong-sam is left alone, 
neither reconciliation and unity of the nation nor the peace and 
reunification of the country can be achieved and only 
confrontation and war will befall. 
  The anti-national, anti-reunification group forsaken by the 
people must be overthrown. 
  An analyst of MINJU CHOSON says: 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet government is a stumbling block in 
the way of reunification. If the cause of national 
reunification is to be promoted, the block must be removed 
resolutely.
