  [Text] Pyongyang, March 9 (KCNA) -- These days words are 
abroad in the high-placed quarters of the South Korean 
"Democratic Liberal Party" (DLP) complaining at the call of U.S. 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Hubbard for the abolition 
of the "National Security Law" (NSL), according to a radio 
report from Seoul. 
  The traitor Kim Chong-pil, chairman of the "DLP", voiced 
opposition to the call, grumbling that the speech of Hubbard was 
problematic. The "chief of the DLP's Policymaking Committee" 
expressed "apprehensions" over the official position of the 
United States calling for the abolition of the "NSL", terming it 
"an interference in the internal affairs". 
  Such outbursts of the South Korean puppet clique ignoring 
the 
unbiased public opinion are an open challenge to all the fellow 
countrymen who want to see the notorious "NSL" scrapped, bring 
the North-South dialogue to a success at an early date and thus 
to achieve the reunification of the country. It is a graphic 
manifestation of the puppets' anti-national, anti-reunification 
stand. 
  What must not be overlooked is that the puppets let loose 
such preposterous remarks as "the North's line of reunification 
through the communization of the South" and "human rights 
situation of the North", connecting the question of the 
maintenance of the "NSL" with the North. 
  Their malicious abuses and slander against the North are 
nothing but despicable attempts to conceal their grisly human 
rights problem and, all the same time, to suppress the South 
Korean people's struggle for independence, democracy and 
reunification and block the North-South dialogue and 
reunification of the country at any cost by preserving the "NSL". 
  For peace on the Korean peninsula and a peaceful 
reunification of the country the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must 
be removed and such fascist laws as the "NSL" be scrapped in 
South Korea without delay.
