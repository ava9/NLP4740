<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Raps Kim Yong-sam's Separatist Outcry" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam 
recently at a party in "Chongwadae" contended that the 
reunification of the country is "fantasy," "unification concept 
must be discarded." 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says no one but a 
separatist dead set against reunification can make such remarks. 
  The news analyst says: 
  It is crystal-clear that the traitor Kim Yong-sam wants a 
permanent division of the country and fratricidal war, not 
reunification and peace. 
  It is a never-to-be-condoned crime for him to block 
reunification desired by the nation and drive the chariot of 
permanent division for the sake of his personal ease and power. 
  The South Korean people have concluded once again that the 
reunification of the country is impossible as long as the 
traitor Kim Yong-sam is left alone. 
  For the reunification of the country, the supreme desire of 
the nation, the Kim Yong-sam group of separatists must be 
removed as early as possible. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam must look straight at the trend of 
the nation toward reunification, give up the anti-reunification, 
separatist moves, step down and face judgement by history as 
demanded by all people.
