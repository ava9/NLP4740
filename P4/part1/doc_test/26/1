Stanford University has charged taxpayers $2,500 to refurbish a grand piano, 
$3,000 for a cedar-lined closet and $2,000 a month for flower arrangements at 
the official residence of the university's president, according to 
congressional investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The figures were discovered after federal auditors questioned millions of 
dollars that Stanford had billed the government for government-backed research 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Naval Research, which monitors payments to Stanford for all 
government research, said Thursday that a five-person team will be sent to Palo 
Alto to investigate allegations concerning the billing practices. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, faced with questions from the congressional investigators, Stanford 
disclosed that the university had repaid $184,286 that it had erroneously 
charged the government for depreciation on a 72-foot yacht, complete with 
Jacuzzi, as well as on other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional investigators now are sifting through thousands of vouchers at 
the university in preparation for a hearing early next year on the manner in 
which Stanford has billed the government for overhead costs associated with 
government research. 
</P>
<P>
"We have recently discovered a number of charges that have been absorbed by the 
government that neither I nor the taxpayers financing these costs would 
consider reasonable or proper," Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) said in a letter 
asking federal auditors to step up their examination of research overhead costs 
at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, compared the 
inquiry to the early stages of an investigation of billing practices in the 
defense industry. He indicated that similar questions may exist at other 
universities, and investigators said that Stanford is only the first of several 
schools that will come under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Horton, Stanford's associate vice president for public affairs, said that 
the university has followed proper guidelines in billing the government and 
provided auditors with what it believes are justifications for the figures 
challenged in audits. Negotiations over the charges are under way, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Horton said that Hoover House, the residence of university President Donald 
Kennedy, is owned by the school and used regularly for campus activities. He 
said that some costs associated with it can properly be allocated to research 
overhead. He said he is aware that costs associated with the piano, closet and 
flowers are under review but that no judgment has been made that they are 
unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
However, Horton acknowledged that the depreciation costs associated with the 
yacht were mistakenly passed on to the government and were repaid as soon as 
they were discovered. He said that the repayment does not actually involve 
returning money but rather that it offset future costs. 
</P>
<P>
The university has hired two Washington law firms to represent it in dealings 
with Dingell's subcommittee on oversight and investigations, which is leading 
the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was triggered by unrest among the Stanford faculty over the 
high overhead rate that the university charges the government for research and 
complaints from a government auditor. The professors were concerned that the 
rate might price them out of the market for some government projects. 
</P>
<P>
The rate is meant to cover indirect costs to the university associated with 
research, such as buildings, utilities, administration and libraries. 
Universities also add such items as tennis courts and faculty discounts for 
football tickets to the rate, contending that such costs are associated with 
persuading top people to work for them. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford charges the government 74 cents for every dollar the government spends 
on research at the school to cover those indirect costs, one of the highest 
rates in the nation. That means that the government must pay Stanford $1.74 
million for a $1-million research project. At Yale, the rate is 68% and at MIT 
it is 62%. 
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1989, Stanford was paid $241 million for government research, 
including overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators for Dingell and the General Accounting Office, an investigative 
arm of Congress, said they suspect that Stanford and other universities shift 
as much of their operating burden as possible to the government. 
</P>
<P>
For 1991, Stanford is seeking a rate of 78%. However, a federal audit completed 
in September and obtained by The Times said that only 61% appeared justified. A 
decrease in the rate would cost Stanford millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Riddle, Stanford's comptroller, said auditors have received additional 
documentation and he expects the full rate request to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
Auditors have also raised questions in at least two recent audits about 
millions of dollars in library overhead costs that the university has billed to 
the government. For instance, the auditors have questioned $2.3 million in such 
costs that Stanford says should be paid by the government because it 
represented space and material used for research. The auditors have challenged 
the way the school calculates those costs, and that matter also is being 
negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
The yacht Victoria was donated to the school's sailing program in December, 
1987, and included in athletic department equipment. Depreciation costs on the 
equipment, including at least eight other boats and a prefabricated building, 
were charged to the government as part of overhead costs.
