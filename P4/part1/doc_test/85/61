<F P=106> [Editorial: "Prime Minister's Firm Stand"] </F>
  [Text] If U.S. Senator Larry Pressler is quoting Indian 
Prime Minister Narasimha Rao correctly and if the prime minister 
is not refuting his claims, then Rao's assertions on defense 
policy can be described as the most important statement of his 
term -- the most important because the statement is directly 
related to India's nuclear policy. Since the prime minister has 
explained his viewpoint to Pressler and spoken on the 
controversy currently raging in the United States on the 
Pressler Amendment, there can be no other meaning to his alleged 
statement. After assuming the reins of power, the Clinton 
administration has tilted so much toward Pakistan that the 
President -- restless to resume military aid to Pakistan -- 
considers the Pressler Amendment as a thorn in his way. The 
amendment provides that Pakistan will not be eligible to receive 
U.S. military aid unless and until the U.S. President certifies 
that Islamabad is not pursuing its program to manufacture an 
atom bomb. It was on this very ground that the former President 
George Bush had stopped military aid to Pakistan. It will now 
be difficult for Clinton to certify, contrary to his 
predecessor's decision, that Pakistan is not pursuing a nuclear 
bomb program. In the meantime, contrary to the above, many 
facts have come to light that dispel any doubts about Pakistan's 
ability and intention to manufacture a nuclear bomb. Meanwhile, 
the Lockheed company is increasing pressure on President Clinton 
to allow the supply of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan. This proves 
that, after failing in its bid to repeal the Pressler Amendment, 
the Clinton administration has now thought of formulating the 
policy of a one-time waiver of the Pressler Amendment to allow 
the supply of F-16 planes to Pakistan and later making the 
amendment operative again. 
  I is apparent that with the help of this policy, a sheer 
humbuggery, the Clinton administration wants to make Pakistan 
stronger than India by getting rid of the Pressler Amendment, 
which will only result in the revival of the arms race in the 
Indian Subcontinent. The policy also tacitly encourages 
Pakistan to manufacture an atom bomb. India has thus far 
adopted the policy of not making any nuclear weapon. In spite 
of this, India has not yet signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT] because it thinks NPT is unfair to the nonnuclear 
states. However, if the United States chooses to patronize 
Islamabad's nuclear policy on the pretext of supplying F-16 
aircraft to Pakistan, then India will be forced to review its 
nuclear options, and this is the very meaning of Prime Minister 
Rao's alleged statement. If read in the context of our 
government's disinterestedness in Raphel's planned visit to 
India, the home minister's two warnings to the United States in 
parliament, and the successful role played by the Indian 
delegation at Geneva, one can derive the message that India's 
future attitude toward the U.S. can be firm and admonitory. 
Anything contrary will depend solely on the U.S. behavior.
