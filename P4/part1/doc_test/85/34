<F P=106> [Report by Jean-Pierre Clerc: "Pakistani President Makes </F>
Case for Nuclear Policy to Francois Mitterrand"] 
  [Excerpt] Returning from a 10-day "private" -- albeit very 
official -- trip to the United States, Pakistani President 
Farooq Leghari had a stopover in Paris, during which time he was 
received for an hour or so on Thursday, 12 June, by French 
President Francois Mitterrand. Elected last November, Mr. 
Leghari, 54, is an old militant from Benazir Bhutto's Pakistani 
People's Party [PPP]. He was PPP secretary from 1978 to 1983 
during the dark days of persecution by the Zia dictatorship. 
This experience enabled this affable man to send President 
Mitterrand greetings from the Pakistani prime minister, whose 
charm was much appreciated by Mr. Mitterrand during his 1990 
trip to Islamabad. 
  According to Mr. Leghari, the two men talked about the 
"nuclear issue." By all appearances, the Pakistani leader 
sought to verify Paris' lack of flexibility in its position on 
supplying a nuclear power plant that had been promised in the 
past, before France shied away after signing the NPT [Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty]. 
  The issue of "nonproliferation" has been in play for a long 
time, since Islamabad, which is strongly perceived as the 
capital of a country which is capable of making "the bomb," or 
which has even been credited with already possessing a dozen of 
them, is being subjected to pressure to sign the NPT, especially 
by the Americans. Mr. Leghari repeated that Pakistan has long 
been prepared to sign if India, the brother and enemy against 
whom three wars have been fought in the past, does the same. 
  "We are prepared to undergo inspections provided that both 
sides are subject to them," he repeated. The problem is that 
New Delhi, which exploded an atomic device in 1974 and which is 
apparently ready to install missiles with nuclear capability 
pointed at Pakistan, has rejected all suggestions which could 
muzzle its security needs, on the grounds that such needs are 
also reflected vis-a-vis China, against which it fought a war in 
1962. [passage omitted]
