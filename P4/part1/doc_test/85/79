<F P=106> [Commentary by Abhinav Kautilya: "Out of Line: The Issue is </F>
not Human Rights, but Clinton's Autocracy"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] When people who dropped 
nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and played with the lives of millions 
of innocent women, the elderly, the handicapped, and the sick, 
and made the earth there unproductive forever, are now talking 
about human rights in Kashmir, then it appears we are not 
listening to a president [Clinton] but to a sick person 
suffering from mental illness in an asylum. India, in comparison 
with the way the Americans cut down the Vietnamese like 
vegetables and grass, is miles away from sinking to this level. 
Clinton has said that terrorism and religious fundamentalism is 
nothing; the real thing is human rights. [passage omitted] 
  What is happening in Kashmir? One or two thousand crazed 
Pakistanis are shouting and carrying weapons in their hands, 
telling us that they will decide where they will live. This 
really is something. We do not have to accept what hundreds of 
thousands of voters want or the wishes of those who elected 
representatives to Kashmir's Vidhan Sabha and the Indian 
Parliament. Instead, we should listen to the people fighting a 
guerrilla war with weapons from Pakistan and the United States 
of America. The United States wants us to honor and pamper them. 
  The depth to which Mr. Clinton wants us to go down in 
relation to human rights is the same as we wish to follow. It is 
true that human rights belong to humans, but who are humans? 
Only those who follow truth, religion, non-violence, and are of 
good character and high ideals are humans. This is the old, 
accepted standard. Now we say generally that any person who 
believes in law and order is human. Anyone who is not human is a 
devil. If we ignore the old definition, then whoever ignores law 
and order is a non-citizen or inhuman. We can also say that 
person is a criminal. From this perspective, U.S. President 
Clinton is advocating the position of criminals in Kashmir. 
[passage omitted] 
  Human rights have not been defined by the United States, but 
by the United Nations. No other member of the United Nations has 
noticed any human rights violations; only the United States has. 
Now it seems that God has given all intelligence and vision only 
to Bill Clinton. It seems that Clinton is not only the President 
of the United States, but the greatest autocrat in the world.
