  [Text] President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has said, as a 
result of sound economic policies adopted by the present 
government, the climate for foreign investment in Pakistan has 
become lucrative. The president was addressing Pakistanis in New 
York. The president said the response of foreign investors to 
the government's incentive package has been very positive. As a 
result of macroeconomic management, foreign investment in 
several sectors -- particularly in the sector of power 
generation -- will increase in the days to come. 
  He said Pakistan's nuclear program is not weapon-oriented. 
We have taken a conscious decision not to use our nuclear 
capability for weapon production unless our security is 
threatened. The president said Pakistan has told the United 
States that no unilateral solution could be imposed on Pakistan. 
Any solution to the nonproliferation problem in South Asian 
region has to be evolved in the regional context. He said 
Pakistan had proposed in 1974 that the South Asian region be 
declared a nuclear-free zone. Since then, Pakistan has made six 
more concrete proposals to achieve nonproliferation in the 
region, but India has rejected all of them. Under the 
circumstances, the United States or the world at large could not 
expect realistically that Pakistan would accept any unilateral 
obligation.
