  [Text] The president, Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, has 
said Pakistan is firmly committed toward establishing an 
equitable and nondiscriminatory nonproliferation regime in South 
Asia. Addressing the inaugural ceremony of the National 
Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering in 
Faisalabad today, he said Pakistan's nuclear program is purely 
peaceful and we have no intention to develop a nuclear weapon. 
The president said we will welcome and cooperate on any 
proposal from any quarter to make South Asia a nuclear-free 
zone. However, Pakistan will not accept unilateral restrictions 
on its peaceful nuclear program on the pretext of 
nonproliferation. 
  Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari said Pakistan has acquired 
political stability after a long time. The government is now 
concentrating on promoting industrial infrastructure by 
advancing science and technology in the country.
