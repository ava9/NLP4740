  [Text] The U.S. Deputy secretary of state, Mr. Strobe 
talbott, had a meeting in Islamabad with Prime Minister Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto during which they discussed matters of mutual 
interest to both the countries. Earlier, Mr. Talbott discussed 
bilateral matters, including Kashmir and nuclear 
nonproliferation, with Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali. 
He also held talks with officials in Islamabad during which 
they reviewed entire spectrum of bilateral relations. 
  Briefing newsmen about the talks, a Foreign Office spokesman 
said the two countries have agreed to the concept of 
multilateral talks on South Asian security and to hold 
consultations with each other in order to develop an appropriate 
framework. The spokesman said that the president and the prime 
minister reiterated Pakistan's desire for continued close and 
cooperative relations with the United States in the post-cold 
war period. 
  The spokesman said during the talks consideration was given 
to the two nonpapers presented by the United States to Pakistan. 
These dealt with the proposal for multilateral talks on South 
Asian security, proposing a verifiable capping of the production 
of fissile material by Pakistan in the context of removing the 
impediments in the supply of defense materials. Consistent with 
its well-known position, Pakistan expressed support for the 
objectives of promoting nonproliferation regionally and 
globally. The two sides agreed to proceed with further 
consideration of this initiative with a view to evolving an 
agreed and equitable approach. 
  Replying to a question, the spokesman said Pakistan made it 
clear that it would not accept any unequal and inequitable 
obligation as far as nonproliferation is concerned. Pakistan 
would not accept anything which places it at an disadvantageous 
position politically, militarily, and security-wise. It was 
ready to accept any nondiscriminatory and equitable proposal for 
this purpose vis-a-vis India, but not unilateral capping of its 
nuclear program and it remained our position even today. 
  To another question, the spokesman emphatically stated that 
Pakistan is opposed to the deployment of ballistic missiles in 
South Asia. 
  He said Mr. Talbott reiterated the desire of the United 
States to maintain the long-standing friendly and cooperative 
relationship with Pakistan. He informed the president and the 
prime minister that Pakistan was today as important as it was 
during the cold war era, both regionally and globally and it had 
a crucial role in the region. The spokesman in reply to another 
question said Pakistan's stand on Kashmir remains the same that 
the dispute should be resolved in accordance with the United 
Nations resolution that calls for plebiscite in Jammu and 
Kashmir. The United States, the spokesman said, has expressed 
its willingness to assist in the solution of the dispute if this 
was agreeable to both the parties. 
  Addressing a news conference in Islamabad this afternoon, 
the 
U.S. deputy secretary of state underscored strong commitment of 
his country of maintaining good friendly relations with 
Pakistan. He said the two sides also agreed on the elimination 
of nuclear weapons from the entire South Asian region, 
especially through talks in a multinational forum. He 
emphasized that the American proposal for nuclear 
nonproliferation in South Asia qualifies to be even-handed and 
has a regional and trans-regional approach. Mr. Talbott said 
President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher had 
asked him to convey this commitment to Pakistani leaders that 
the United States was determined to champion and broaden this 
relationship further. He said his talks with the president, the 
prime minister, and the foreign minister covered supply of 
F-16's aircraft, capping of nuclear program, and other regional 
and global issues. He said his dialogue with Pakistan will 
continue to advance the goals of nonproliferation and to end 
arms race in the region. Mr. Talbott said they are aware that 
Pakistan Government is not going to accept any initiative unless 
the government and the people are convinced that the American 
initiatives serve the security interests of Pakistan. He said 
the United States is not asking for a roll back of the nuclear 
program, but is suggesting a verifiable capping. About the 
supply of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan, he said further discussion 
on this will take place.
