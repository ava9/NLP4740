  [Text] Islamabad, May 26 -- Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto 
said on Thursday that Islamabad had given counter proposals in 
response to U.S. suggestion that Pakistan should allow 
non-intrusive inspection of its nuclear installations. 
  "The question of non-intrusive inspection is an American 
proposal and we have given counter-proposals based on a regional 
solution," Ms Bhutto said at a news conference on her return 
from Nepal. 
  She was asked to comment on a recent statement of Foreign 
Minister Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali in which he had said that 
Pakistan was ready to allow non-intrusive inspection of its 
nuclear installations. 
  Denying that the foreign ministor had made any such offer, 
she said: "Pakistan will not accept any unilateral solution or 
proposal." 
  Questioned whether President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari would 
be discussing the nuclear issue with American officials during 
his current visit to the United States, the Prime Minister said 
though the President's visit was a private one, "we are using 
this occasion to have informal talks with U.S. officials and to 
explain Pakistan's position on the nuclear issue." 
  Ms Bhutto said she would also be visiting the United States 
by the end of this year. "I hope it will be a substantive 
visit." 
  The Prime Minister said the Pressler Amendment, which debars 
Pakistan from getting U.S. military and economic aid, was a 
discriminatory law, "and we want it should go." [sentence as 
received] 
  Ms Bhutto said Pakistan shared US concern over nuclear 
proliteration, "but we feel the Pressler Amendment is a veto in 
the hand of India." 
  She said Pakistan and the United States were cooperating in 
anti-narcotics campaign and defence of human rights, and added 
that the two could move in the nuclear non-proliferation field 
provided a regional approach on this issue was agreed upon. 
  Pakistan, she said, was anxious to improve its relations 
with 
the United States, but hastened to add that it did not want to 
do so just for having F-16 fighter aircraft. 
  "We don't want one-dimensional relationship. It should be a 
multi-dimensional one," she asserted. 
  Ms Bhutto said Pakistan had supported America during Soviet 
invasion of Afghanistan. "We have defended freedom in 
Afghanistan and we are cooperating with the United Nations in 
its peacekeeping preparations in Somalia and other parts of the 
world," she said, while calling for closer relationship between 
the two countries. 
  She said her government was building Pakistan as a modern 
Islamic state where rule of law would be supreme. She said a 
society would be built where women would have an equal role to 
play. A women's police station had already been set up and 
women's courts would also be established, she said. 
  Answering a question, Ms Bhutto said she wanted the 
opposition to cooperate with the government on three main issues 
-- Pakistan-U.S. relations, Pakistan-India ties and the nuclear 
issue. "On these three subjects we (the government and the 
opposition) should have a unified stand," she said.
