  [Text] The president, Mr. Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, has 
said that Pakistan attaches the highest importance to peace and 
security in the Indian Ocean, as the country depends heavily on 
the sea for trade, commerce, and other economic benefits. He 
was addressing the 60th midshipmen commissioning parade at the 
Pakistan Naval Academy [PNA], PNS Rahbar, in Karachi today. On 
arrival at the naval academy, the president was accorded the 
general salute. He reviewed the parade. The president gave 
prizes to the outstanding midshipmen. He gave the chairman, 
joint chiefs of staff committee, gold medal to Cadet Mohammad 
Amin Sharif, PNA dirk for runner-up to Midshipman Mohammad 
Waheed, and the sword of honor to Midshipman Rahim Akbar. 
Champion division and winner of proficiency banner was Fox-1 
Division. 
  Speaking on the occasion, the president said the Indian 
Ocean 
constitutes the lifeline of the world economy, as about 
one-fourth of international trade passes through it. He said 
Pakistan being a littoral state, its concern is perfectly 
legitimate; and inexplicably large naval buildup by any country 
in the region naturally and understandably heightens our worries 
about the security of our shores and the safety of our sea 
lanes. He said this concern can be allayed if the Indian Ocean 
is declared a zone of peace. 
  Congratulating the passing-out midshipmen, the president 
emphasized the need for a high spirit of patriotism. The 
commanding officer of the academy said that the highest 
professional training has been given to the passing-out 
midshipmen. March past and salute to the president by the 
midshipmen. [video shows midshipmen marching past and saluting

the Pakistan naval fleet. 
  Later talking to newsmen informally at PNS Rahbar in Karachi 
today, the president said that Pakistan had agreed to 
participate in the Indo-Pak secretary-level talks, as it 
sincerely desired the solution of the Kashmir dispute. The 
president said, moreover, it was a welcome move for Pakistan, as 
during the last three decades, it was for the first time that 
India had agreed to discuss the Kashmir issue. It was 
heartening to note that at least Kashmir was recognized as a 
legitimate dispute, the president added. The president said 
from Pakistan's view, it was a victory as at last India finally 
recognized that Kashmir is a disputed territory which needs 
ultimate solution. He said the resumption of Indo-Pak talks was 
actually a support from Pakistan to the liberation struggle of 
the Kashmiris, as it greatly values their just struggle. Mr. 
Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has said that Kashmir issue is a most 
intricate issue and one should not expect immediate results.
