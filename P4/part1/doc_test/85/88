  [Text] The Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] secretary 
general, Dr. Hamid al-Ghabid, called on President Farooq Ahmad 
Khan Leghari at the Aiwan-i-Sadr [President House] today and 
discussed with him various problems facing the Muslim world. 
The secretary general briefed the president about the various 
efforts made by the ICO to put an end to hostilities in 
Afghanistan. He also informed the president about his current 
mission to affect a cease-fire in the strife torn country which 
will pave the way for a dialogue between the warring factions. 
  The president briefed Dr. al-Ghabid about the appeals made 
by 
Pakistan and other steps taken by it to restore peace in 
Afghanistan. He wished him all success in his efforts and 
assured him of all possible cooperation by Pakistan. The 
Kashmir problem and situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina also came up 
under discussion during the meeting. Dr. Hamid conveyed to the 
president the ICO's deep concern and anguish over the situation
