<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Nuclear Program and the Prime Minister's </F>
Credibility"] 
  [Text] In an interview with the GULF NEWS, former Army 
Chief General Aslam Beg claimed that during the tenure of her 
previous government, Ms. Benazir Bhutto withheld research on the 
nuclear missile program. He added that despite that order, work 
on the manufacture of long-range nuclear missiles continued for 
one year until August 1991. Efforts were also made to acquire 
M-11 missiles from China. But they were not be successful at 
that time. Gen. Beg also explained that since the United 
States is trying to deprive Pakistan of a means to carry a 
nuclear warhead by suspending the supply of F-16's, the armed 
forces of Pakistan should give priority to the manufacture of 
missiles to carry warheads. According to Gen. Beg, research had 
been continuing until the end of his term despite Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto, in her capacity as the prime minister, banning it. 
  Gen. Beg's revelation requires the prime minister to take 
the 
nation into confidence and to explain why she issued orders 
against the production of missiles, which are so indispensable 
for the defense of the country and the nation. Earlier, Ms. 
Bhutto herself revealed that during her previous tenure of 
office she helped Rajiv Gandhi crush the Sikh freedom movement. 
Reports have also appeared now about Ms. Bhutto capping 
Pakistan's nuclear program during her previous term of office. 
These reports will definitely create doubts and apprehensions 
among the people about the credibility of Ms. Bhutto as a 
national leader and prime minister of Pakistan. Therefore, it is 
imperative upon Ms. Bhutto to make necessary clarifications on 
the television and try to remove doubts and misgivings. 
  The Pakistani nation is much more sensitive than India on 
defense matters and there is a national consensus that we must 
be equipped with a nuclear deterrent to protect ourselves from 
Indian aggression. The nation rejected the recent U.S. pressure 
and it is not ready to allow an inspection of its nuclear 
installations in exchange for F-16's. The government should not 
make any mistake in realizing the sentiments of the nation and 
the needs of the country. 
  The reports published the other day about the meeting of the 
troika -- the president, the prime minister, and the army chief 
-- in connection with the upcoming visit of President Farooq 
Leghari to the United States are not at all a matter of 
satisfaction for the nation. These reports said that the 
government formulated a policy of rejecting a unilateral roll 
back of the nuclear program. The fact is that Pakistan cannot 
roll back its nuclear program even bilaterally, let alone 
unilaterally. First of all, India will not agree to it. The 
second is that Pakistan is several times weaker than India even 
in terms of conventional forces and weapons. Therefore, progress 
in the nuclear field should be our only aim in order to ensure 
the security of our nation and the protection of our country's 
independence.
