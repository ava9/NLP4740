The Alaska criminal trial for fired Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood has 
been delayed until early next year. The significance of the case prompted 
prosecutors and defense lawyers to suggest a delay, and during a hearing, a 
state Superior Court judge canceled the Oct. 30 trial date and set Jan. 8 for 
the start. Hazelwood, 43, is free on $50,000 bail. He faces three misdemeanors 
-- operating the tanker while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent 
discharge of oil -- and three felony counts of criminal mischief. Hazelwood's 
lawyers have filed motions to dismiss some of the charges. The defense also is 
seeking to move the trial out of the small town of Valdez. Hazelwood was in 
command of the Exxon Valdez when it ran aground March 24, spilling nearly 11 
million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound.
