FEDERAL DAMAGE SURVEY OF EXXON VALDEZ BEGINS

The National Transportation Safety Board on Monday began a thorough survey to 
determine the extent of damage done to the tanker Exxon Valdez when it ran 
aground March 24 in Alaska's Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
The physical inspection marked the first time that investigators have set foot 
on the ship that ran aground on a reef. The NTSB has been relying on 
photographs taken by divers who surveyed the ship's damaged hull from the 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
But inspectors now will have the opportunity to step inside the Valdez and 
physically inspect its damaged hull, its holding tanks and a complex system of 
pipes and valves that load and unload oil. 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB will be accompanied by representatives from the state of Alaska, Exxon 
and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the oil-company consortium that operates the 
trans-Alaskan pipeline. The investigation is being conducted at National Steel 
&amp; Shipbuilding Co., where the crippled tanker is in dry dock. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to, in a quantitative way, determine the extent of damage," said 
Lou Colucciello, chief of the NTSB's Washington, D.C.-based marine accident 
division. "It's being done with the participation of parties and will take 
several days." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Lot of Measurements 
</P>
<P>
Crews will "make measurements to determine how deep the penetrations were, how 
extensive the damage was," Colucciello said. The survey team "will do a lot of 
photographing and measurements," Colucciello said. "We'll spend lots of time 
collecting relevant facts on the accident." 
</P>
<P>
The Valdez, which was built in San Diego by Nassco, is a single-hulled ship. 
When the damage survey is completed, Nassco crews will repair an area 700 feet 
long and 100 feet wide. They also will repair any holding tanks and piping that 
are damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB report might not be completed for about six months, Colucciello said. 
The federal agency will analyze data gathered in the inspection and publish a 
report that will include the probable cause of the accident and any 
recommendations that might reduce the likelihood of a similar accident. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the state Department of Fish and Game late last week 
completed its involvement in the long-running saga of the Valdez by forwarding 
results of a final ocean-water test to the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
The sample concluded that the Valdez was responsible for an oil slick that 
appeared in the ocean July 10 as the ship awaited permission to enter San Diego 
Bay, Reed Smith of the fish and game department said. A Coast Guard spokesman 
was not available on Monday to comment on whether charges will be filed against 
Exxon.
