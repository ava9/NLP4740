Loaded oil tankers leaving Alaska will be accompanied by oil spill response 
vessels under a plan submitted by the industry Tuesday to meet state demands 
for a spill response following the Exxon Valdez disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The new Tanker Spill Prevention and Response Plan for Prince William Sound will 
guarantee that spill response vessels and equipment will be ready to respond 
immediately to a spill the size of the Exxon Valdez, said Nick Mitchell, a BP 
Shipping Co. official who coordinated development of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which is expected to cost the oil industry $45 million annually, was 
developed for the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., which operates the trans-Alaska 
oil pipeline and Valdez terminal for its seven oil company owners. 
</P>
<P>
Alyeska is obligated to mount the initial response to any tanker spill and has 
come under attack for its response to the Exxon spill before the company 
initiated its own effort. 
</P>
<P>
But while promising to be ready to fight the next spill, Alyeska stopped short 
of promising any better results. 
</P>
<P>
"If the question is, can we guarantee that we can pick up an 11-million-gallon 
spill, the answer is no, we can't guarantee it," Alyeska spokesman Tom Brennan 
said.
