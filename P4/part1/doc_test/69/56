Joseph Hazelwood, the former captain of the Exxon Valdez, the supertanker that 
spilled 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound, said in a Life 
magazine interview that he has been a scapegoat for aspects of the disaster 
that were the responsibility of others. Hazelwood, who goes on trial Jan. 29 in 
Anchorage on criminal mischief charges for his role in the oil spill, said he 
feels the media has laid all the responsibility for the damage caused by the 
spill on his shoulders, despite what he called an inadequate initial cleanup 
effort.
