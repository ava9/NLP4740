  [Text] United Nations, 21 Jan (XINHUA) -- A Chinese 
representative said here today that only by making a definite 
commitment to the complete prohibition and thorough destruction 
of nuclear weapons and by adopting appropriate and resolute 
steps to that end will the measures of nuclear states to prevent 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons have a genuine significance. 
  The second session of the preparatory committee for the 1995 
conference of parties to the Treaty on Nonproliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons was convened this week at the United Nations 
Headquarters in New York. Sha Zukang, head of the Chinese 
delegation to the session expounded China's views on how to 
effectively prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
  Sha Zukang said China recognizes the importance of the 
prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons as well as 
the maintenance of an effective international legal mechanism 
for that purpose. At the same time, China also believes that 
nonproliferation by itself is not the ultimate goal that the 
mankind should pursue, and that the real objective should be 
complete prohibition, thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, 
and realization of a nuclear-free world. 
  Sha Zukang believes that only by making a definite 
commitment 
and by adopting appropriate and resolute steps to that end will 
the measures of nuclear states to prevent the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons have a genuine significance. He said failure to 
do that will perpetuate the defect of the existing imbalance in 
the treaty in the rights and obligations between the nuclear and 
nonnuclear states. To realize quickly the objective of the 
total prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, a 
large number of nonnuclear countries have given up the option of 
acquiring and developing nuclear weapons; however, their demand 
for security guarantees has not been fundamentally satisfied. 
  Sha Zukang said the Chinese Government believes that 
conditions are ripe for all nuclear states to make the 
commitment of not being the first to use nuclear weapons and not 
to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear 
states and nuclear free zones. 
  Sha Zukang criticized some big nuclear powers for a lack of 
sincerity for peace in this respect. He said if nuclear states, 
particularly the big nuclear powers with global nuclear attack 
capability, are unable to take even the limited step of 
guaranteeing that they will not be the first to use nuclear 
weapons and not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons 
against nonnuclear states and nuclear free zones, how can they 
expect the large number of nonnuclear states to trust their 
sincerity for peace. 
  He pointed out that it will be difficult to ensure 
universality and enduring effectiveness for the international 
nuclear nonproliferation mechanism if nuclear states only make 
one-sided emphasis on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons 
and if they only emphasize their own absolute security to the 
neglect of the nonnuclear states' legitimate security concerns.
