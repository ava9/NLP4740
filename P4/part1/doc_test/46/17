  [Text] Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Chinese Foreign Ministry declared in connection with an 
underground nuclear testing on June 10 that China always stands 
for complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear 
weapons and, within this context, the realization of a 
comprehensive nuclear test ban, and said China fully respects 
and understands the position and concern of many non-nuclear 
weapon states on the question of nuclear testing. 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says it is the 
United 
States which tops the world's list in nuclear testing and 
stockpile of nuclear weapons and it is again the U.S. which has 
deployed them in all parts of the world and interferes in 
others' internal affairs, threatening them with those weapons. 
  The analyst goes on: 
  The United States has carried out over 1,000 times of 
nuclear 
tests for the development and modernisation of nuclear weapons 
since the 1940s. It decided to allocate 11.7 billion dollars to 
the production of nuclear warheads of new types in fiscal 1995. 
  It wantonly interferes in the internal affairs of other 
countries on the pretext of "non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons" and recently worked out even a "nuclear 
non-proliferation strategy". The "strategy" is intended to 
counter "proliferation of nuclear weapons" even by using such 
kinds of weapons. 
  Such being the situation, nuclear states which have 
relatively few nuclear weapons, to say nothing of non-nuclear 
states, cannot but stand against the nuclear threat of the 
United States and seek a self-defensive measure. The 
underground nuclear testing of China this time can be considered 
in this context. 
  A self-defensive measure stands out as a more urgent matter 
for Korea. The U.S. hardline conservative forces are increasing 
military threat as never before, pursuing "sanctions" against 
the DPRK. International reactionaries and some countries are 
doing base acts, dancing to the tune of the U.S. this proves 
that the United States and its followers are trying to isolate 
and stifle Korean socialism at any cost over the nuclear issue. 
  We have done and are doing everything we can to solve the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. But the moves for 
stifling us are assuming growing intensity. Under this 
condition, we cannot but take a tough action as has been 
decided. We have the right to take a self-defensive measure. 
  The United States and its followers must know that this is 
not an empty word.
