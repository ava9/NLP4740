  [Text] Beijing, May 3 (AFP) -- The Chinese Foreign 
Ministry said Tuesday it was "not aware" of any upcoming nuclear 
test by China, as announced by the Japanese Government. "China 
keeps the attitude of utmost restraint towards nuclear tests. 
The number of nuclear tests it has conducted has been quite 
limited," a ministry spokesman said. "I am not aware of any 
nuclear test in the near future." 
  Deputy Japanese Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito on Monday 
said China would soon carry out a nuclear test, and called on 
Beijing to scrap the operation. A western expert in Beijing 
said "it would not be surprising" if there were a nuclear test 
in the near future, as China carries out such tests in the 
spring and the autumn for climatic reasons. 
  China's last nuclear explosion took place at the underground 
Lop Nor site, in the northwest of the country, on October 5. It 
was the 38th test -- other counts put it as the 39th -- carried 
out in the autonomous region of Xinjiang since 1964. Foreign 
experts said the test, with a yield of 70 to 80 kilotonnes, was 
apparently part of a miniaturisation programme aimed at 
developing a multiple-warhead missile. 
  The United States has carried out around 950 nuclear tests, 
Russia about 600, France 200 and Britain 60.
