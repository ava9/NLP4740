  [Text] The Kazakh Foreign Ministry has issued a statement 
in connection with the underground nuclear test carried out by 
the PRC at Lop-Nor test site on 10 June. It says: Kazakhstan 
is persistent in its policy of banning nuclear tests and signing 
relevant agreements. President Nursultan Nazarbayev addressed 
heads of nuclear states in August 1993 with a proposal to extend 
a moratorium on tests of weapons of mass destruction till the 
year 2005. During his visit in October 1993 to the PRC he held 
talks with the Chinese leadership. He briefed the Chinese 
leadership on Kazakhstan's stance with regard to nuclear tests. 
  Kazakhstan has approved a declaration made by the PRC's 
Foreign Ministry that said China understands concern of 
non-nuclear states regarding nuclear tests. The foreign ministry 
notes that the last test in China was carried out during [words 
indistinct] of moratorium on nuclear tests. The statement says: 
It worries us this test was carried out in the neigboring state 
and might cause serious problems in ecology and (?people's 
health). The Kazakh Foreign Ministry believes it is necessary 
to resume the discussion of the specific proposals by Kazakhstan 
on setting up a joint group of experts on the problems of 
Semipalatinsk and Lop-Nor test sites.
