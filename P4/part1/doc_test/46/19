A comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty (CTBT) could be completed by early
1995, according to Mr Miguel Marin-Bosch, chairman of the United Nations
negotiating committee, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. He said yesterday
that the negotiations, which began in January, had made faster progress than
expected and he hoped for an initial draft treaty text by late spring.
A treaty was 'do-able in a relatively short time of 12-18 months', he added,
enabling it to be finished just before or just after the April 1995
conference on extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
A number of developing nations have made a CTBT a condition of their
agreeing to an indefinite extension of the NPT.
Mr Marin-Bosch, Mexico's ambassador to the UN Disarmament Conference in
Geneva, said there seemed to be broad agreement for the treaty 'to ban all
tests in all environments for all time'. This would include so-called
'peaceful' nuclear explosions as well as nuclear weapons tests, though the
possibility of exceptions was being discussed. The treaty would contain
extensive verification measures and provisions for economic sanctions
against those violating the ban.
There was universal support for a CTBT despite 'varying degrees of
enthusiasm', Mr Marin-Bosch went on. China, which is still testing atomic
weapons despite a moratorium by the other four declared nuclear powers, has
said it will not test after 1995.
More than 2,000 nuclear tests have been carried out since the second world
war, equivalent to one a week, the majority by the US and the former Soviet
Union.
