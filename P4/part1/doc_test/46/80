FRANCE yesterday responded to President Bill Clinton's decision to suspend
US nuclear testing by calling for a global ban on tests. A statement from
President Francois Mitterrand's office said France was 'in favour of a
treaty banning tests completely providing it is universal and verifiable'.
The French have not carried out any nuclear tests since the former Socialist
government suspended them in April last year. However, nuclear planners are
seeking a series of tests on two new submarine-launched weapons, the M45 and
M5. French tests are undertaken at Mururoa atoll in the south Pacific.
In addition, prime minister Edouard Balladur has come under pressure from
right-wing members of his centre-right coalition government to resume
testing. The National Assembly finance committee last week approved a paper
calling for the resumption of tests.
Mr Balladur yesterday said on French television that he was 'in complete
agreement' with Mr Mitterrand. He said he and Mr Mitterrand planned to 'put
our minds at rest' by forming a group of military and scientific experts to
ensure that France's nuclear deterrent did not suffer as a result of the
suspension of tests.
British ministers say the UK can 'live with' a US test ban as long as it
receives assistance in computer simulation techniques to replace live tests.
The UK has to follow Washington's policy, since it relies on the US test
site in Nevada.
The UK Ministry of Defence said it had no plans to test elsewhere and would
seek further consultations with the US. British planners are believed to
want tests to update the WE-177 gravity bomb, which will have to stay in
service beyond the end of the century, and to perfect safety features on the
UK warhead for the Trident submarine-launched missile. However, the main
programme of Trident warhead tests is complete.
Limited further testing need not prejudice progress towards a comprehensive
test ban treaty, the ministry said. Britain has recently taken a more
positive stance towards a complete ban, after previously only paying lip
service to the idea as a 'long-term objective'.
In the US Mr Sig Hecker, director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory,
made clear he had wanted to carry on testing right up to the implementation
of a comprehensive test ban.
'We would have preferred more time to prepare for the test ban,' he said.
The nuclear laboratories have argued that they needed more tests to improve
the safety of the US's nuclear arsenal.
After a divisive debate in the administration, pitting the Pentagon, the
State Department and the nuclear weapons laboratories against the Energy
Department and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the White House had
initially come down in favour of nine further tests - three of which would
have been British - in the next three years.
Mr Clinton's ultimate decision to extend the moratorium on tests, unless
another nation resumes testing, reflects belated recognition of the
political reality that both the House of Representatives and, more
surprisingly, the Senate remained solidly opposed to more tests.
The decision to extend the moratorium will, however, provide comfort to
Russia, whose Foreign Ministry on Friday called for urgent discussions 'to
achieve a verifiable international agreement that will totally ban nuclear
testing'.
