<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Nuclear Testing: Balladur Disagrees </F>
With Mitterrand"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday closed the 
48th session of the IHEDN [National Institute for High-Level 
Studies] at the French Military School with a speech in which he 
stated his views on defense. The text of his speech revealed 
that he does not share the views of the president of the 
Republic with regard to nuclear deterrent policy. 
  The prime minister did not rule out "the possible restart of 
nuclear testing, depending on the international situation and 
the behavior of the other nuclear powers," stressing that 
"France never agreed to link the suspension of its nuclear 
testing with the negotiation" of the Complete Test Ban Treaty 
(CTBT). Mr. Balladur explained that this possible restart of 
testing and "our involvement in the negotiation" of the treaty 
"were not therefore incompatible." The prime minister reiterated 
that, on 13 October, he had told the National Assembly that the 
government "would not subscribe to any definitive ban on testing 
as long as it felt such testing was essential to the technical 
credibility of our deterrent force." 
<H5>  `Threshold' Countries </H5>
  With these words, Mr. Balladur set himself apart from the 
stance taken on nuclear testing by Mr. Mitterrand last Thursday. 
In a speech to 200 guests, including representatives of the 
military establishment and arms manufacturers, the head of state 
assured his audience that "for as long as he remained in office, 
there would be no further testing." He also said he was 
convinced that "after [he had gone], they would not [restart 
testing] because France will not want to offend the whole world 
by restarting the arms race." He added: "I have confidence in 
my successors; they will not be able to do otherwise," 
implicitly referring to the upcoming diplomatic deadlines of the 
revision of the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1995 and the 
conclusion of a test ban treaty expected shortly afterwards. 
  The prime minister also asked that the "threshold" countries 
(those on the verge of acquiring nuclear arms) should 
participate in the drawing up of the CTBT, something that is not 
currently envisaged. Edouard Balladur considered that the 
"forum for negotiation, which must be multilateral, should 
immediately involve the threshold countries." He continued: 
"It is very important for the disarmament conference to extend 
as far as possible so that all threshold countries are 
represented." With regard to the implementation of the treaty, 
Mr. Balladur warned that it could only take effect if the 
threshold countries also ratified it. 
  While the chairman of the committee charged with drawing up 
the text for this complete test ban after the winter session of 
the disarmament conference said at the end of March that this 
treaty could be ready by 1995, Mr. Balladur emphasized that 
"there was absolutely no fixed deadline for the conclusion" of 
the treaty which is to "settle numerous and complex" issues. 
The prime minister added that the government would refuse "in 
particular that the extension of the NPT at the May 1995 
conference were dependent on the conclusion of a CTBT." He 
warned: "The failure to extend the NPT could place question 
marks over our commitment to a test ban treaty." 
<H5>  Conscription To Remain </H5>
  In addition, Edouard Balladur considered that the mixed-army 
system was "certainly not designed to be inflexible," even if, 
"in the short- to medium-term, the Armed Forces cannot do 
without conscription." Mr. Balladur continued: "The government 
has made choices for the foreseeable future, some 15 years 
hence," and he considered it "high likely" that "the system will 
evolve in one direction or another after that time." Where the 
"modalities of this evolution" were concerned, the prime 
minister said that he thought it was "wiser to firstly implement 
the military programming law (...) before trying to imagine 
future changes." 
  Nevertheless, the prime minister stressed that he "did not 
believe" that a professional Army would "be sufficient to meet 
French defense obligations and ambitions." He said: "France 
has ambitions and responsibilities far beyond its national 
borders (...) which require a large [defense system]." He 
pointed out that a professional Army not only posed the question 
of structural coherence in view of missions, but also of human 
resources and cost. 
  With regard to staffing levels, Mr. Balladur estimated that 
some 48,000 men would have to be hired every year if 
conscription were to be abolished. He noted that the United 
Kingdom had "problems recruiting 28,000 men per year." With 
regard to cost, he explained that if forces were reduced by 20 
percent as a result of total professionalization, there would be 
"annual additional expenditure of 20 to 25 billion francs." He 
added: "Thus, unless the defense budget were increased together 
with levy on national wealth, abolishing conscription would lead 
to a drastic reduction in the size of the Armed Forces."
