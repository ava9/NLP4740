<F P=106> ["Dispatch" on interview with Hou Zhitong by staff reporter </F>
He Hongze (0149 3136 3419) and China Radio International 
reporter Liu Hui (0491 2547) at the United Nations in New York; 
date not given: "Arduous Tasks for Disarmament and Arms 
Control--Interviewing Envoy Lou Zhitong, Chinese Disarmament 
Expert"] 
  [Text] Envoy Hou Zetong is China's well-qualified expert 
on disarmament. For many year he has constantly participated in 
UN negotiations and discussions on disarmament issues. After 
attending a session of the UN Disarmament Commission, which was 
held not long ago, he gave these reporters an interview. 
  He maintained: With the end of the Cold War, great changes 
have indeed taken place in the international situation. The 
bipolar pattern has been smashed and the confrontation between 
the two military blocs has disappeared. Nevertheless, the 
military might of those countries is still around. In 
particular, the United States and Russia still possess huge 
nuclear and conventional arsenals. The nuclear threat has not 
yet been eliminated. Moreover, at present, regional conflicts 
keep emerging. The world, including Europe, is far from being 
tranquil. In this sense, the issue of disarmament and arms 
control remains as it was before and the task of disarmament and 
arms control is still very arduous. 
  Envoy Hou pointed out: The main difference in disarmament at 
present lies in the focal point of nuclear disarmament. Some 
Western nuclear powers contend that great progress has been made 
in nuclear disarmament. The current focal point should be on 
the prevention of nuclear proliferation. However, many 
nonnuclear countries hold that although progress has been made 
in nuclear disarmament, there is still a long way to go in this 
regard. Further nuclear disarmament is still a current task of 
top priority. If this problem is not solved, it will be 
difficult to extend the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
indefinitely. 
  Attending the session with a positive and responsible 
approach toward the issue, the Chinese delegation 
comprehensively expounded the Chinese Government's principled 
stand on disarmament and put forth a document on weapons 
transfers and a proposal not to be the first to use nuclear 
weapons, to which various countries in the world have attached 
importance. When discussing this issue, Envoy Hou stressed the 
current practical significance of the proposal not to be the 
first to use nuclear weapons. He said: Since the emergence of 
nuclear weapons, the world has always been under the shadow of 
the threat from nuclear arms. Hence, there is the question of 
upholding or opposing the use of nuclear weapons. By upholding 
a policy of nuclear deterrence, Western countries argue that 
nuclear weapons can be used if necessary. China and many other 
countries hold a view opposed to this argument. When it 
conducted its first nuclear test in 1964, China unilaterally 
declared the commitment not to be first to use nuclear weapons 
and not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear countries. 
Now that the Cold War has come to an end, all the parties 
concerned are considering establishing a new international 
order. Some progress has been made in nuclear disarmament. The 
time is ripe for the five nuclear powers to sign a treaty 
committing themselves to no first use of nuclear weapons. 
Moreover, it is also relatively easy for them to reach an 
agreement. This proposal has been well received by the 
international community. It received a positive response from 
Russia. In March this year, the Chinese Government officially 
invited the other four nuclear powers to come to Beijing to hold 
talks on the issue. However, some nuclear powers lack a 
positive approach toward the invitation. 
  Envoy Hou also briefed these reporters on the issue of a 
complete prohibition of nuclear tests. Although the current 
session did not touch the issue, the Geneva disarmament 
conference was carrying out tense negotiations on it. 
Prohibiting nuclear tests is a universal demand of the 
international community. However, in the last few decades, no 
treaty on a complete prohibition of tests has been concluded. 
China's stand is that the complete prohibition and thorough 
destruction of nuclear weapons should be achieved as soon as 
possible. Prior to this, some partial measures can be taken. 
It is relatively difficult to conclude a treaty with which all 
the parties concerned are satisfied and which can be subject to 
international nuclear checks and to achieve a complete 
prohibition of tests. In spite of this, we support holding 
negotiations, and, together with other countries, we will strive 
for the conclusion of a treaty no latter than 1996. At the same 
time, we hold that in any treaty, the scope of the test ban and 
relevant definitions should be clear and definite so that no 
party will have their own interpretations of them and that the 
treaty will be free of loopholes and will not be turned into 
another treaty like that of 1963. This requires great efforts 
from all countries. 
  Based on his experience in attending negotiations on the 
disarmament issue over the years, Envoy Hou maintained: 
Compared with previous ones, the current disarmament 
discussions and negotiations are more practical, but they are 
also more difficult as they are entwined with regional issues. 
Nevertheless, disarmament is the common wish of the people of 
the world. The work of the UN Disarmament Commission should be 
strengthened rather than scrapped. It will play a more important 
role in world peace and security.
