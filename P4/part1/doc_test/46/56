  [Text] Beijing, June 12 KYODO -- Chinese Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen told his visiting Japanese counterpart Koji Kakizawa 
on Sunday [12 June] that U.N. sanctions on North Korea would be 
"ineffective," but that China is willing to play a "positive 
role" in seeking a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue, a 
Japanese official said. 
  While the meeting of the two foreign ministers focused 
mainly 
on the nuclear question on the Korean peninsula, Japan also 
condemned the underground nuclear test carried out by China last 
Friday, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said. 
  "It is extremely regrettable that the People's Republic of 
China conducted another nuclear test. Japan has always regarded 
the nuclear test ban as one of the highest priorities in the 
field of disarmament and it strongly urges China not to repeat 
nuclear testing in the future," Kakizawa was quoted as saying. 
  On the North Korean nuclear issue, Qian said China "will 
participate positively in the discussions within the framework 
of the United Nations and is ready to play its own positive 
role," the spokesman said. 
  The Chinese foreign minister said applying sanctions to 
North 
Korea would be ineffective, judging from the fact that it has 
already been isolated and has little economic contact with the 
rest of the world, he said. 
  The spokesman refused to speculate on whether China would be 
willing to go along with U.N. Security Council sanctions under 
discussion, or whether it would veto such sanctions. 
  "We explained to our counterpart our view that the situation 
demands that the international community as a whole, through the 
United Nations Security Council, consider an appropriate 
response, including sanctions," he said. 
  "Our purpose is not to bring about punitive measures. 
Rather, our objective is that North Korea dispel the doubts of 
the international community over its nuclear development and it 
come back to the dialogue table," he said. 
  Kakizawa said Japan values highly the work China has already 
done on the issue and stressed the importance of China playing a 
"positive role within the framework of the U.N.," the spokesman 
said. 
  The two foreign ministers also discussed other issues of 
bilateral concern, including growing and increasingly 
"interdependent" economic and trade ties and China's entry into 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), he said. 
  Kakizawa's one-day visit follows his talks with South Korean 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Undersecretary of State 
Peter Tarnoff, held Saturday in Seoul on the recent developments 
of the North Korean nuclear issue
