NORIEGA: THE CARTEL COULDN'T TOUCH HIM WHEN HE WAS A TOP DOG. NOW THAT HE'S A

On Christmas Eve, Gen. Manuel A. Noriega quietly slipped into the Papal 
Nunciature in Panama City and asked for asylum. Almost immediately, the stock 
of the new government of Guillermo Endara went up and resistance to U.S. 
military forces declined. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega undoubtedly will get the asylum, and the safe transit, he seeks. 
Although some parties will protest, in the long run everyone -- with the 
exception, perhaps, of Noriega -- will breathe easier for it. 
</P>
<P>
Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
The Roman Catholic Church can hardly turn away a downtrodden suppliant (even if 
he is a thug), especially since the papal nuncio has had dealings with Noriega 
in the past. Further, to hand Noriega over to the United States might be 
interpreted as an endorsement of the U.S. military action, which the nuncio 
certainly would want to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
More basically, the principle of sanctuary has a historical dimension for the 
church. If the church turns Noriega over to the United States at Washington's 
request, that will jeopardize the principle for the future. The loser next time 
around could be a Cardinal Mindszenty. After the ill-fated 1956 Hungarian 
uprising, Cardinal Josef Mindszenty, Roman Catholic prelate of Hungary, took 
refuge for 15 years in the U.S. Embassy in Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
In the past Spain had offered Noriega a place to retire, but under very 
different circumstances. Today, it is more likely that Noriega will try to get 
into Cuba, a better place to live than Nicaragua, his other regional ally. But 
despite long ties to the Havana government, there is no love lost between 
Noriega and Fidel Castro. The Panamanian might just be one additional burden 
that the already beleaguered Castro doesn't need right now, or he might be 
welcomed as the latest symbol of Latin American resistance to Yankee 
imperialism. 
</P>
<P>
The Endara government and most Panamanians want him dead or out of the country, 
not on trial in Panama City. To try him in court there would bring up far too 
much dirt about far too many people still in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Panama cannot legally honor a request to turn over Noriega since it 
has no extradition treaty with the United States. It would be foolish to try to 
force Endara to go against Panamanian law, for that would strengthen the 
(untrue) case that the new president is just a creature of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, for all the tough statements on bringing Noriega to Florida to stand 
trial, it isn't all that clear that the United States wants -- or should want 
-- him here. There is reason to doubt the strength of the two indictments 
against him. Through he undoubtedly was involved in drug dealing, the 
indictments were based on evidence from convicted drug dealers who were plea 
bargaining. The trials could be messy, even unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Were he to go on trial, his lawyers would demand all sorts of documentation 
that could prove detrimental to U.S. security. After all, Noriega worked for 
years with U.S. intelligence agencies and the military. 
</P>
<P>
But Noriega has a problem with exile -- the drug lords. In the past he has had 
disputes with the Medellin cartel. As long as he was top dog in Panama, he was 
useful to them. Now that he is a nobody who knows far too much about the drug 
business, they would much prefer to have him in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, sanctuary followed by asylum suggests that the immediate solution of the 
Noriega problem is at hand, and with it much improved prospects for an end to 
all fighting and the growth of the new Panamanian society. Ultimate justice for 
Noriega, however, may yet be administered by the more lawless elements of the 
world.
