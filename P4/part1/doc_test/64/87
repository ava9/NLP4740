The head of security for deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega on 
Sunday abandoned Panama's Vatican Embassy, where he had taken refuge after last 
December's U.S. invasion, and immediately went into hiding, Panamanian 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The escape of Eliecer Gaytan, who was Noriega's chief bodyguard, prompted a 
full-scale manhunt by U.S. and Panamanian authorities, a local radio station 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Television news reports showed the embassy ringed by American troops and 
Panamanian police. 
</P>
<P>
Gaytan took refuge on Dec. 23 in the Vatican Embassy, joining Noriega, who 
later handed himself over to U.S. authorities to stand trial in Florida on 
drug-related charges. Gaytan remained for the next nine months.
