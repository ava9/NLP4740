<P>
Fallen Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega refused today to recognize the 
jurisdiction of a U.S. court and a judge entered a plea of not guilty on 
charges that he took $4.6 million to turn his nation into a way station for the 
cocaine trade. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega surrendered Wednesday night to U.S. troops outside Panama City's 
Vatican Embassy 10 days after he took refuge there, and was flown into 
Homestead Air Force Base south of Miami under cover of night. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. marshals with binoculars scanned the downtown area continuously from atop 
the federal courthouse and patrolled halls in plain clothes, but otherwise kept 
a low profile in what U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler said was an 
effort to treat Noriega like any other defendant. 
</P>
<P>
His attorneys, however, argued that he is anything but a normal drug suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot submit to the jurisdiction of this court. Gen. Noriega will stand 
mute at the arraignment," defense attorney Frank Rubino said as he and 
co-counsel Steven Kollin waited to see their client for the first time since 
his surrender. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly a year ago, Hoeveler had ruled that the United States has jurisdiction 
over Noriega, rejecting defense claims of immunity for a head of state. The 
judge said the State Department never recognized Noriega's political 
legitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
Kollin has noted other potential legal pitfalls in the case, including extreme 
pretrial publicity and Noriega's links with U.S. intelligence agencies, but 
U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said he was confident the case was solid. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush and other White 
House officials will be careful about what they say lest they prejudice the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's surrender was met with joyous celebrations in the streets of Panama 
City and Miami that continued today. 
</P>
<P>
The general -- who had ruled for six years, thumbed his nose at two U.S. 
Presidents and annulled a 1989 election he apparently was losing -- gave up, 
still wearing his military uniform, after realizing even his supporters had 
turned against him, the archbishop of Panama, Marcos McGrath, said today. 
</P>
<P>
"The people feel a sense of peace knowing that the monster is leaving our 
land," said Panamanian President Guillermo Endara, frequently a target of 
Noriega's thugs. 
</P>
<P>
An indictment accuses Noriega, who is in his 50s, of accepting $4.6 million in 
bribes from Colombian drug cartels to aid and protect their smuggling and 
processing -- charges that carry 145 years in prison and $1.1 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega is not covered by the new U.S. law allowing execution of drug kingpins, 
an assurance he reportedly demanded before turning himself in. He also faces 
drug charges in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment names 15 other people, including the reputed head of the 
Medellin cocaine cartel, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, who is being hunted by 
Colombian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
One of Noriega's right-hand men, Lt. Col. Luis del Cid, surrendered to U.S. 
troops after the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama and has pleaded innocent. 
Prosecutors have refused to say if he will testify against his former boss. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops who seized Noriega's military headquarters in Panama City 
reportedly found documents and files supporting the prosecution case. 
</P>
<P>
That, along with the arrests of Del Cid and other minor figures, has made the 
case stronger than when the indictment was issued two years ago, said Richard 
Gregorie, who headed the investigation until he left the U.S. attorney's office 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said today that Noriega was handcuffed and advised of his legal 
rights as an accused drug trafficker as he flew back to the United States under 
jet fighter escort. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said Noriega traded his general's uniform for a one-piece flight 
suit and took off in an Air Force C-130 for Miami only 43 minutes after he 
surrendered to U.S. troops at the Vatican Embassy in Panama City Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The troops took Noriega from the embassy to Howard Air Base in a helicopter and 
turned him over to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials before he was 
put aboard the C-130, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
"On board the plane, two U.S. military doctors examined him and pronounced him 
fit to fly," Williams said, adding that Noriega was made to trade his brown 
slacks and tan shirt with military emblems for a zippered Air Force flight 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Fitzwater told reporters that Noriega was handcuffed at 
one point, although he could not say how long the handcuffs were kept on. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department spokesman David Runkel told reporters a DEA agent read 
Noriega his constitutional rights in Spanish aboard the plane after it took 
off, taking Noriega to Florida to face drug-trafficking charges. 
</P>
<P>
Runkel was unable to say whether the agent questioned Noriega after telling him 
he had the right to remain silent or to have an attorney present during 
questioning.
