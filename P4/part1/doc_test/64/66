Police have frozen between $3.4 million and $4.3 million held in French bank 
accounts by ousted Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega, judicial 
sources said in Paris today. 
</P>
<P>
The order came from a French magistrate investigating allegations that the 
accounts may have been used to launder profits from illegal drug trafficking, 
the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
They said at least five accounts in the names of Noriega and members of his 
family have been frozen since Friday. The money was deposited with at least two 
French banks, the Credit Industriel et Commercial and the Banque Nationale de 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The magistrate acted after French authorities were tipped off by U.S. 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The French sources said part or all of the cash held in France was about to be 
moved to Luxembourg when police moved in. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Justice Department said today it asked authorities in France 
and three other European countries to freeze bank accounts where it believes 
Noriega stashed millions of dollars in illegal drug profits. 
</P>
<P>
"We have taken steps today in four European countries to freeze assets in 
numerous" accounts, said David Runkel, the department's chief spokesman. 
Officials said Noriega hid at least $10 million in the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
As the department sought to gain control of Noriega's money, U.S. officials in 
Panama and Washington negotiated with the Vatican, whose embassy in Panama City 
took in an exhausted Noriega and 10 associates who sought asylum Sunday. 
Noriega's regime was toppled Dec. 20 by U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials sent letters to authorities in France, Switzerland, Luxembourg 
and Britain asking them to halt transactions in the bank accounts belonging to 
the deposed Panamanian dictator, Runkel said. 
</P>
<P>
Based on records seized in Panama, U.S. officials believe they can document 
that the money in the overseas accounts stemmed from Noriega's alleged drug 
dealing, Runkel said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have to demonstrate to the banking officials" that the money was 
earned illegally, he added. He said "preliminary discussions" were under way 
with other countries where Noriega has money. 
</P>
<P>
While the Justice Department is trying to freeze $10 million, the State 
Department estimates Noriega's worth at about $200 million to $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech last August, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger 
alluded to multimillion-dollar transactions Noriega has made over the last two 
years involving accounts in West Germany, Switzerland and Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department attorneys are confident that banking officials in the four 
European countries will cooperate with their request. "We've had a remarkable 
display of international cooperation," Runkel said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said there is a possibility that Noriega, his family or his bankers have 
already transferred the money out of some of the accounts since the U.S. 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Freezing the accounts is the first step in a process to seize the assets, 
Runkel said. Distribution of the money, however, would be governed by the laws 
of the countries where the cash is hidden.
