Journalists at The Independent newspaper called yesterday for a full
Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation of the bid for its owner by
a consortium which includes Mirror Group Newspapers.
The appeal came in a formal statement to the Department of Trade and
Industry yesterday from the National Union of Journalists branch at the
paper, which represents 270 journalists out of 340 eligible editorial staff.
The journalists accused Mr Andreas Whittam Smith and the other founders of
The Independent of abandoning the paper's principles.
The statement said: 'If ever a takeover bid called for the impartial, public
scrutiny of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission this one does.'
The consortium - which groups MGN with The Independent's founders, El Pas of
Spain and La Repubblica of Italy - has made an improved offer for the shares
of Newspaper Publishing, owner of the two titles, valuing the company at
Pounds 73m.
The NUJ yesterday criticised the view of the consortium that an MMC
investigation should be waived on the grounds that it is 'a matter of great
urgency'.
It said: 'The degree of interest from other quarters suggests the exact
opposite.'
The journalists argue that if the plight of the newspapers really is urgent
all the leading shareholders including Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of
Independent Newspapers of Ireland which holds 29.9 per cent, should try to
reach agreement on working together.
Newspaper Publishing is still awaiting an improved cash alternative to the
consortium offer before it can become a recommended bid. Independent
journalists believe redundancy terms may be causing a delay.
