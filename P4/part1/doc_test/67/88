FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Trombone changes bid tone - David Wighton
considers BAe's response in the battle for VSEL

The timing and funding structure for British Aerospace's increased offer for
VSEL may have taken City observers slightly by surprise. But few had doubted
that BAe would respond to GEC's rival bid. And few now doubt that the battle
has a long way to go.
The fight over VSEL is part of a wider struggle between GEC and BAe for
dominance in the UK defence business. For both companies the stakes are
high.
Although BAe's share price fell in response to the novel rights issue
yesterday, the general City reaction was that the company had significantly
strengthened its hand.
Not only has it matched GEC's cash offer and topped it with its share swap
terms, it has given itself the flexibility to raise the terms again if GEC
continues the bidding.
Mr Sandy Morris, engineering analyst at NatWest Securities, described the
timing and structure of the offer as astute. 'The bid had started to look
like a fait accompli but BAe has shown itself prepared to go head to head
with its major competitor. At least it will emerge with its reputation
enhanced.'
BAe's institutional shareholders also expressed support, although some took
the cynical view that the company thought it had little chance of winning
and had structured the funding to guarantee itself a Pounds 178m equity
injection if it failed.
BAe said the novel two-stage fund raising, known in the City as a 'trombone
issue', enabled it to compete with GEC on equal terms.
Under the terms of the original bid BAe offered shares worth about Pounds
12.60 per VSEL share with a cash alternative of Pounds 11.40, provided by
selling shares to institutions which were underwriting it for a fee.
If BAe wanted to increase the terms its advisers would have to go back to
the institutions to underwrite the cash alternative.
'The process makes you as visible as a herd of elephants to the opposition
who can see exactly what you are going to do,' said one of BAe's advisers.
But by raising money through an underwritten rights issue BAe can increase
the terms without going back to the institutions.
'We can act very quickly, very simply and very secretively,' said Mr Richard
Lapthorne, BAe's finance director. BAe argues the move puts it on more level
terms with GEC which plans to fund its bid from its large cash pile.
In effect BAe has asked its shareholders for a blank cheque. To give some
comfort to the institutions it has agreed to ask for shareholders' approval
before declaring a successful higher bid unconditional.
BAe's chances of success are partly in the hands of the Office of Fair
Trading. BAe has argued strenuously that GEC's bid should be referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission on competition grounds. GEC already owns
Yarrow, the UK's other big warship builder.
Some observers have suggested that if the GEC bid alone were referred to the
MMC BAe could have won control of VSEL with its original offer. However, BAe
said yesterday that it believed VSEL shareholders would now not accept less
than GEC's Pounds 14 a share, even if GEC was barred from bidding.
'Expectations have been raised,' said Mr Lapthorne.
He denied that the improved offer reflected an assumption by BAe that GEC's
bid was unlikely to be referred alone. Mr Dick Evans, BAe chief executive,
even suggested that BAe's move might improve the chances of GEC being
referred by demonstrating that BAe's financial position was not an issue.
Another potential benefit of the improved offer is that it may allow BAe to
buy VSEL shares in the market. It cannot do so at a price above the value of
its share offer, which has prevented it making such purchases so far.
Yesterday VSEL shares closed at Pounds 14.88, just 16p above the value of
BAe's share offer.
GEC already holds 15 per cent of VSEL and cannot make further purchases in
the market under VSEL's articles.
Thanks to its tax losses and Pounds 100m of unrelieved advance corporation
tax BAe would pay no tax on VSEL's profits. It calculates that even at the
higher offer a successful takeover would enhance its earnings per share by
more than 10 per cent next year.
NatWest Securities believes that taking over VSEL would now boost its
earnings from 35.7p to 40p, compared with 42.4p under the original terms.
Other analysts believe the enhancement would be slightly smaller and that
the deal would actually dilute earnings thereafter.
However, most believe BAe would raise the stakes again in the likely event
that GEC continues the bidding.
