Germany yesterday joined forces with the UK to press the case for
deregulation and flexible labour markets in the European Union.
The UK-German alliance at the Corfu summit received measured suport from Mr
Silvio Berlusconi, the new Italian prime minister.
Mr Berlusconi called for less law-making from Brussels, though he told Mr
John Major, Britain's prime minister, at a breakfast meeting, that he did
not support Britain's opt-out of the social chapter of the Maastricht
treaty.
EU leaders - joined by their finance ministers - discussed the European
economy in their afternoon session against the background of an incipient
recovery but no sign of a halt to the rise in unemployment.
Top items were the European Commission's White Paper on employment, growth
and competitiveness, including progress on starting major infrastructure
projects known trans-European networks, as well as a report on the 'new
information society' in Europe.
Leaders also discussed the Commission's recommendations on macro-economic
guidelines, the framework for the 12 members of the Union to move toward a
single European currency, to be joined by Austria, Finland, Sweden, and
Norway if they enter the Union as planned next year.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, praised the
macro-economic guidelines, which call for wage restraint, budgetary
discipline, and structural reforms of the labour markets to create new jobs
and lift burdens on small business.
Mr Clarke supported Germany's request for the establishment of an
independent group of businessmen and civil servants to examine whether EU
and national legislation is imposing unnecessary red tape on companies.
Separately, the UK Chancellor made a pitch for faster liberalisation of the
European telecommunications industry.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the Commission, avoided a re-run of last
December's clash with finance ministers over funding of the trans-European
networks.
He failed then in his bid to win support for greater European Commission
borrowing to fund the multi-billion rail and road projects.
However, Mr Delors called for a 'firm commitment' to start work on 19
'priority' infrastructure projects.
These include 11 transport projects such the Channel tunnel link in the UK;
a high-speed rail and road link through the Brenner pass linking Italy,
Austria and Germany; and an eastern EU high-speed train between Paris and
Strasbourg, plus a link joining Munich, Leipzig and Berlin.
In addition, there are eight multi-billion Ecus energy projects including an
underwater cable link between eastern and western Denmark; an underwater
electricity cable between Italy and Greece; and a natural gas line between
Spain and Portugal, with energy supplied from Algeria.
Aides to Mr Delors said the Commission president was most anxious to start
work on the trans-European networks. If the so-called 'financing gap'
materialised, then the Commission would be in a strong position to lobby for
extra borrowing powers.
British officials called for an in-depth analysis of the 19 projects.
There was no obvious shortage of capital for the networks, given the lead
role of the European Investment Bank, private capital and the newly
established European Investment Fund.
'If there are obstacles, they are of an administrative, legislative or
planning nature,' said one UK official.
