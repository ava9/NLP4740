The months of dialogue between trade unions and employers at European level
in search of agreement on the establishment of works councils in European
multinationals finally broke down yesterday.
With voluntary agreement between the social partners ruled out, the European
Commission will now proceed with a works council directive which is likely
to be passed at the end of the year.
The directive will require at least one meeting a year between employer
representatives and top management of a company to discuss investment,
production plans and redundancies.
It is is likely to affect about 1,000 companies in Europe and become law in
most countries in 1996 or 1997.
Works councils have been a matter of controversy between European unions and
employers for more than 20 years, with employers insisting that the form of
consult-ation should be left up to companies.
It had been hoped that a voluntary agreement between Unice, the European
employers' body, and the European Trades Union Congress, might be possible,
especially after Unice shifted towards the ETUC position by accepting the
principle of a legal right to information for employees.
But yesterday ETUC said that the withdrawal from the negotiations of the
Confederation of British Industry, the main British employers' body, had
undermined Unice's negotiating authority. The CBI was unhappy about the
earlier concessions that Unice made.
Mr John Monks, general secretary of the British TUC, one of the main
affiliates of the ETUC, said: 'What the employers have now done is make a
directive on this inevitable.'
The directive is likely to be passed under the German presidency later this
year, but will not become law for another two years at least.
It will not directly affect the UK as works councils are covered by
Britain's opt-out from the Maastricht Treaty. However, it is estimated that
at least 100 UK companies will be affected through their continental
European subsidiaries and most of them are likely to include their UK
employees.
Elsewhere, the directive will affect all companies with more than 1,000
employees operating in a minimum of two EU countries and with a minimum of
100 in one of the countries.
The directive will provide for voluntary arrangements within companies to be
agreed between unions and employers but will have a fall-back statutory
model.
That will require meetings of a works council at least once a year, with
other meetings triggered by particular events such as mergers or mass
redundancies.
The directive will lay down the areas which must be the subject of
discussion, the level within the company at which discussions must take
place, and minimum and maximum participants.
Statutory European works councils will not be a significant cost item for
companies, although they will have to foot the bill for travel and
interpreters.
But European companies and employers organisations have long argued that
while they agree with the goal of consultating and informing employees they
believe that there should be flexibility about how it is achieved.
Unions, on the other hand, have set great store by trans-national works
councils and see them as the first step towards trans-national collective
bargaining, a long-standing union goal.
