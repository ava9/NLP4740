for Trans World

Emap's Pounds 71m bid for Trans World Communications, the local radio group,
is to be the subject of a judicial review after a successful application by
Guardian Media.
Guardian Media, which owns 20 per cent of Trans World, and the company's
management have questioned the legality of a scheme devised by Emap to get
round the limits on the ownership of radio licences.
The scheme, which involves Emap transferring two of its existing licences
into a joint venture with Schroders, the merchant bank, has been approved by
the Radio Authority.
At a hearing yesterday Mr Justice Latham gave Guardian Media leave for a
judicial review of this approval.
He ordered an urgent hearing as soon as possible after July 18. It is
thought a date at the end of the month is most likely.
Emap must post offer documents to Trans World shareholders by July 20.
Emap, which owns 29 per cent of Trans World, launched a full bid of 181p a
share last week after agreeing to buy the 22 per cent stake held by Mr Owen
Oyston.
The Trans World board declined to recommend the offer on the grounds that
Emap was offering an insufficient premium for the shares and that the legal
standing of its ownership scheme was uncertain.
Trans World shares fell 3p to 170p.
