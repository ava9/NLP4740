London Weekend Television's attempt to attract a white knight to help it
ward off the unwanted takeover bid from Granada has collapsed.
US West, the giant US telephone company and one of the largest cable
operators in the UK, was interested in a stake of 29.9 per cent in the
London ITV company - the largest amount possible without triggering a full
bid.
Talks continued all week with the Takeover Panel in order to obtain
permission for US West to approach LWT formally. The panel, it is
understood, refused to clear the approach on the grounds that it would have
constituted a concert party.
At the same time, it now looks highly unlikely that the Granada bid will be
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade and industry secretary, yesterday postponed a decision on referral,
but said he 'would expect it to be possible to resolve' concerns over the
concentration of advertising sales without the need for an MMC reference.
Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT (Holdings), declined to comment on
the US West talks, but said Granada's bid would fail at the current price.
Mr Heseltine's decision could also clear the way for the proposed
acquisition of Central by Carlton. He has asked the Office of Fair Trading
to ensure Carlton and Granada comply with certain conditions on selling
advertising airtime. These could include the divestment of interests in
advertising sales houses or a system of 'Chinese walls' between different
sales operations owned by the same company.
LWT said shareholders should urgently be given details of costs arising from
any unscrambling of sales arrangements. Granada and Carlton were confident
they would be able to comply with the conditions and that no referral would
be necessary.
Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada chief executive, said: 'In our view we will be
able to satisfy the OFT.' Carlton said it was confident that any
undertakings would be consistent with its proposed acquisition.
Advertisers, who had feared that a concentration of advertising sales could
force up prices and lead to unacceptable 'strings' being attached to deals,
were also happy with Mr Heseltine's announcement.
Once the monopolies and mergers situation is clarified - Mr Heseltine has
set a deadline of January 28 for the parties to provide the assurances -
Granada is expected to improve its offer. The likely changes would be an
improvement to the cash alternative now standing at 528p per share and
deciding to pay final dividend to LWT shareholders.
