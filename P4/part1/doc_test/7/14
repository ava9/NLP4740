Journal": "Capsule Instead of Hermes--or What Is Happening With 
the Space Laboratory? New Start for Europe's Space Flights"; 
first paragraph is an introduction] 
  [Text] ESA is pinning its future hopes totally on the 
launching capacity of the Ariane 5. The space laboratory is to 
be adapted for this and a capsule is to be developed as a taxi. 
But what Europe's ultimate contribution to a global space 
station is to look like continues to be disputed. 
  The persistent economic difficulties in its member countries 
and the latest developments concerning the American space 
station are now forcing the European Space Agency (ESA) too to 
reorient itself. Not even quite 10 months after the ministers' 
conference in Granada its director general, Jean-Marie Luton, 
presented at the end of September a new scenario that is to 
serve as a guideline to the year 2000. Manned space flights 
above all have been affected by the changes. 
  One has to adapt, Jean-Marie Luton stated. He said further 
that all the same Europe must not lose its status in space 
travel and has to make an independent outstanding contribution 
to the future global space station. Furthermore, in the context 
of financial and technological cutbacks, ESA is pinning its 
hopes on European participation in the space station and on 
greater cooperation with Russia. The Hermes shuttle is being 
canceled completely, and the Columbus world space laboratory is 
to be integrated in a diminished version into the new Manned 
Space Transportation Program (MSTP). Because both versions of 
the space station that are being discussed at present--with and 
without Russian participation--are now planning the docking of a 
European module not until the year 2002, the entire program is 
to be extended to this point in time and 4 billion European 
currency units [ECU] (8.2 billion German marks [DM]) are to be 
saved. Expenditures of ECU22 billion (DM45.1 billion) were 
planned in the Granada plan for the years 1993 to 2000, and 
these are now to be limited to ECU18 billion (DM36.9 billion) 
for the years 1994 to 2002. Everyone is being affected by hard 
times, the ESA chief said. The most important thing now, Luton 
said further, is to reorganize on the basis of clear performance 
targets and broad agreement and to remotivate the European 
partners in this manner. 
  The foundations of the new scenario are the Ariane 5, whose 
development is to be sped up further without cuts, and the trio 
consisting of the APM (Attached Pressurized Module) space 
laboratory, ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) transfer vehicle 
and CTV (Crew Transport Vehicle) capsule, integrated into the 
MSTP program. At around DM14 billion, the CTV and ATV transport 
elements are to cost only approximately a third of what was 
estimated for Hermes. All three basic elements are to be 
designed so that they can be launched by an Ariane 5. The APM 
laboratory module is a diminished version of the Columbus 
module. Only five double racks for scientific experiments, 
instead of the originally planned eight, are to have a spot in 
it. With a total mass of around 10 tons and a payload of 1.7 to 
3.4 tons, it is approximately equivalent to the Spacelab. 
  A ballistic re-entry capsule, that for reasons of cost is 
not 
to be reusable, is planned for the transport of astronauts and 
cargo. In the manned version it is to be able to transport from 
four to nine persons to the space station. The CTV is 
accordingly three times as large as the Soyuz and is to be 
simpler to handle and more precise when landing, Luton 
emphasized. The European design would also be ideally suited as 
a rescue capsule. 
  The MSTP system will be completed with the ATV transfer 
vehicle. It is necessary in order to take the laboratory and the 
capsule to the space station and to dock them automatically 
there. Two versions weighing 12.7 and 14.5 tons are being 
examined at present. 
  The Ariane 5 would accordingly be the third carrier system 
in 
addition to the Shuttle and the Russian rockets able to succeed 
in placing a space station in a 400-km-altitude orbit with an 
inclination of 51.6 degrees, as planned for the global station. 
Kourou's location close to the equator presents further 
advantages here. Europe's new carrier rocket could, that is, as 
it is being developed at the moment, carry 18 tons to a station 
in this orbit. This is something absolutely new, and a 
strengthening of Europe's position. In the original planning for 
Freedom the Americans permitted only Shuttle flights and charged 
a lot of money for them. 
  However, ESA's new plans also include an independent 
scenario 
for the case of cases that an international space station does 
not come off. Equipped with a logistics module and solar cell 
paddles, the APM could also orbit alone around the earth. 
Jean-Marie Luton emphasized in closing that the paper in 
question is a strategy document and is to serve as a reference 
point for the next two years. The first actual decisions are to 
take place not until at the next ESA ministers' conference at 
the beginning of 1995. 
<H3>  BDLI [Federation of the German Aerospace Industry] Fears 
Further Loss of Jobs </H3>
  It is uncertain whether ESA will manage to succeed with this 
plan with every member country. Though Federal Research Minister 
Kr∆uger and his French and Italian colleagues agree that 
Europe in any case is to take part in phase two of the 
American-Russian space station, however, as it looks, there are 
various opinions about this. The new head of DARA [German Agency 
for Space Affairs], Dr. Jan-Baldem Mennicken, said to the press 
on this matter at the beginning of October, "It is also being 
considered whether it is not possible to do without an 
independent laboratory and integrate Europe's contribution into 
a joint international laboratory." Mennicken said further that 
this has to be discussed in the near future with ESA and the 
industry. Timetables, costs and any disadvantages have to be 
taken into consideration here. The maintenance of the industry's 
technological capacity will play a decisive role in this 
discussion. But the APM is still a stipulated part of the 
program, he stressed. 
  The chairman of BDLI's space flight working group, Horst 
Rauck, demanded in this connection, in the light of further cuts 
in funds, "The Europeans have to take part as equal partners in 
the global space station." Keeping the German contribution for 
ESA at the earmarked sum of DM1.172 billion is the prerequisite 
for this, he says. Otherwise the further weakening of Germany as 
a site for industry and the loss of high-technology jobs are to 
be feared, he stressed. What will remain at the end, with the 
shrinking process of the Columbus European space station, is 
written in the stars. The Freeflyer was stricken off the list a 
long time ago already, and the docked laboratory (APM) has been 
scaled down and postponed once again. We will wait and see.
