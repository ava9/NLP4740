European Engine Makers Plan Development Beyond 2015"] 
  [Text] Bonn, Thursday, 12 May--The European space industry 
is not allowing itself to be disheartened by the current budget 
cuts. The leading European rocket engine manufacturers--German 
Aerospace (DASA), Fiat Avio, SEP (European Propellant Company), 
Techspace Aero, and Volvo Aircraft Engines, Inc.--have signed an 
agreement that is expected to ensure the development of 
high-performance engine systems beyond the year 2015. The 
regular workforce of experienced workers is expected to continue 
to be motivated and their valuable know-how to be safeguarded. 
  Before the German-French Society for Science and Technology 
in Bonn, Roger Vignelles, the chief executive officer of SEP, 
and Werner Inden, a member of the board of DASA/Erno Space 
Technology, Ltd., in Bremen, seemed to be optimistic that 
Europe's space industry could hold its own against the 
competition from the United States, Russia, China, and Japan in 
future as well. 
  Rocket engines are a specific branch of the high-tech 
industry. This is why the experiences amassed and top 
performance obtained in this field over the past 20 years could 
not have been preserved and developed with activities in other 
fields. Moreover, while it takes a very long time to develop 
rockets and their core, the propulsion system, they also have a 
very long operational life. This is why we had to set our course 
for need-oriented developments early on. 
  In the opinion of the five rocket engine manufacturers, we 
can count on the following developments in the 
economic-technical domain over the next 10 years: an increase in 
rocket payloads for the purpose of transporting heavy 
geostationary telecommunications satellites, intensification of 
earth observation, more science satellites, the development of 
satellites weighing from 0.5 to 1 ton for low orbits, a demand 
for military reconnaissance satellites in Europe too, and a 
European contribution to the development of a manned space 
station. In the additional 10 years until 2015 we may count on 
Europe's participation in the operation of a space station and, 
furthermore, on manned space transportation as well as round 
trips to the moon. 
  In the field of telecommunications the number of satellite 
positionings will, to be sure, stagnate, but the payload of a 
carrier will increase every seven years by from 800 to 1,000 kg 
and this will happen despite the huge increase in carrier 
capacities as a result of further miniaturization. 
  After 2015 we can count on drastic cost reductions in space 
transport with completely new fields of application to solve 
mankind's global problems. The catchphrases with regard to this 
are, among others: solar energy from space and (wireless) 
transmission of same to the earth, the alleviation or solution 
of the ozone problem, and the transporting of the rare gas, 
helium, from the moon to the earth. A solar station in outer 
space with an output of 10 gigawatts (as muchas eight 
Biblis-type nuclear power plants produce) will also presuppose 
an entirely new infrastructure on the earth. Furthermore, 
reusable rocket engines will have to be developed. But first the 
development of large (lightweight) structures will also still 
have to be mastered. The development of closed life (survival) 
systems for longer space missions will be an enormous task. 
  In the opinion of the rocket engine makers, the Ariane 5, 
the 
basic development program for which will be completed in 1995, 
still absolutely has the potential for improvement as concerns 
cost reduction, only, however, to a maximum of about 10 percent. 
Greater savings beyond this can only be achieved through new, 
reusable equipment. Moreover, the U.S. shuttle is not de facto a 
really reusable piece of equipment. 
  At the present time the engine manufacturers are thinking of 
developing a small engine for a reusable "demonstrator" weighing 
from 10 to 15 tons in order to "familiarize themselves with the 
technological requirements." In connection with this, the 
Europeans are said to have negotiated with the Russians to let 
them have the appropriate (very advanced) know-how for the 
attractive price of 40 million German marks. 
  In the industry's opinion, the competition in the commercial 
space industry--especially for the positioning of 
telecommunications satellites--will be tougher in the near 
future than up to now between the European Ariane, the American 
Atlas 2AS, possibly a new U.S. development, and, furthermore, 
the Chinese "Long March," the Japanese H2, and the Russian 
Proton. However, the experts acknowledge that the design for the 
Ariane 5 presented in 1984 represents the best combination of 
performance, cost, and reliability.
