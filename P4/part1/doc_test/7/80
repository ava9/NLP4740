<H5>  Current Situation in Japan </H5>
  Japan's space development activities began in 1955 when the 
University of Tokyo succeeded in launching pencil-like small 
rockets. Later, in 1970, Japan's first satellite ``Ohsumi'' was 
successfully launched. 
  In 1957, the Soviet Union succeeded in launching the first 
satellite ``Sputnik-1.'' In 1969, an American made man's first 
landing on the moon, using Apollo-11. In those days, Japan was 
considerably behind these advanced countries in the technology 
level. The National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) 
was set up also in 1969. 
  Through efforts made to enhance its own technology, Japan's 
space development has made steady progress, however, and is 
about to establish its own technology equal to that at the top 
international level, as witnessed in the progress of the 
development of the H-II rocket for launching large-sized 
satellites. 
<H5>  Significance of Space Development </H5>
  First of all, space has infinite possibilities for those who 
seek the truth. The scientific research on space may clarify the 
origins of the universe and organisms and should lead to the 
creation of a cultural era for all mankind. 
  Secondly, the quality of life can be improved, and the 
economy and society can progress through the space activities, 
such as communication broadcasting via satellites, 
meteorological observation and earth observation from space. 
  Thirdly, space development can create new spheres for 
mankind's activities, including space environment utilization 
activities, in which the development of new materials is 
expected. Space activities enable mankind to make use of outer 
space and its resources. 
  Fourthly, the challenge of developing space will require 
interweaving of mankind's wisdom and various advanced 
technologies. This will contribute to intellectual creation and 
the development of new technology. In this sense, space 
activities inherently require international cooperation and will 
promote creation of an international cooperative society. 
<H5>  Fundamental Principles of Space Activities </H5>
  The highest decision-making organization of Japan's space 
activities policy is the Space Activities Commission (SAC). SAC 
has published the national fundamental policy of Japan's space 
development which established long-term goals and political 
guidelines for Japan's space development activities covering 10 
to 15 years. The latest review of the Long-Term Policy was made 
in June 1989. 
  Based on the aforementioned significance of space 
activities, 
this policy says the following three fundamental principles to 
be followed in Japan's space activities: 
<H5>  (1) Response to advancing and diversifying needs </H5>
  As our economy and society progress, needs of society and 
people will become more sophisticated and diverse. Japan must 
execute its space activities in order to enable its space 
development to respond to these needs properly and to create 
efficient systems so that anyone can conduct space activities 
and use space. 
<H3>  (2) Consistency with Japan's role in the international 
society </H3>
  Since space development inherently requires international 
cooperation, Japan, as a member of the international society, is 
expected to make an appropriate contribution consistent with its 
international status. Japan must conduct space activities, 
promoting such international cooperation positively and 
willingly. It is expected of Japan to maintain and improve its 
capabilities to continuously and freely conduct space activities 
which are consistent with its status in the international 
society. 
<H5>  (3) Role of private sector </H5>
  Space development has been conducted primarily by the 
government. With the recent technical developments in this 
field, however, Japan will encourage the private sector to 
obtain sufficient capability considering the proper balance 
between government and private sector's responsibilities. 
<H5>  New Trends in Space Development </H5>
  Following the end of the East-West Cold War era, the world 
is 
now looking for a new international order. The same thing can be 
said in the world of space development. The space development 
policies of the United States and Russia were forced to change. 
The old significance of enhancing the national dignity and of 
supporting military strategies has faded. As a result, advanced 
nations in space development, including the two countries, 
recognize the importance of international cooperation. Now, they 
are cultivating closer international relationships. 
  Today, global issues, such as the earth environment problem, 
which the world faces require global cooperation. The space 
technology that contributes to protection of the earth 
environment, namely earth observation from space, has been 
recognized as a very important activity. Hope for this activity 
is increasing among developing countries in the Asia-Pacific and 
other regions. 
  In Japan, the development of the H-II rocket, with 
international-level launch capability, has progressed, and its 
maiden launch has been set on February 1, next year. 
  Japan also has good prospect in developing large-sized 
satellites. Thus, Japan's space development is steadily 
advancing. Japan now faces the need to establish a future space 
infrastructure as space activities progress. 
  In such new circumstances, Japan must actively promote 
cooperation with advanced countries in developing space taking 
the responsibility for efficient space development in the world. 
She must willingly join the global-scale operations of earth 
observation and other missions to meet the expectation of 
developing countries in the Asia-Pacific and other regions. 
  Furthermore, Japan must make constant efforts to maintain, 
improve and develop her own technology, which is necessary to 
positively and willingly promoting such international 
cooperation and making such international contribution.
