Space Agency: "...Not Assistants, But Partners"] 
  [Text] We're fighting for survival. This year, despite all 
the ukases and decrees signed, we've received only one percent 
of the money promised from the budget. Had we not found 
additional financing from abroad, we would have ceased our 
operations long ago. That is why the draft of the agreement is, 
in fact, beneficial to us. Yes, the amount of money allocated to 
us by NASA seems insignificant. But that's all the American 
space agency could afford from its budget. And yet, that's 
certainly not the only source for attracting hard currency. All 
the rest of the revenues will be decided on at the level of the 
manufacturers themselves. That means direct ties and agreements 
between, say, the Boeing firm and NPO Energiya, or between 
Rockwell and the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau. Each individual 
assembly, rescue craft, spacesuit, and so forth -- for all that 
there are tenders, income, contracts. With that, we agreed from 
the very beginning that the price of an item would be based on 
the value of a norm-hour of work of the engineer and the 
manufacturer in American terms. And there are already three such 
contracts. 
  Yes, we are conducting negotiations that are not very 
simple. 
The complexity of our position stems from the fact that we 
entered that stage when the initial draft of the agreement was 
already worked out. 
  What is fundamental is the station's name itself. We are 
insisting that the station have international status. The 
Americans prefer to call it an American station, with 
participation by foreign partners. We haven't forgotten for a 
minute that the most crucial work has fallen our way -- the 
creation of a space infrastructure. That represents a solid 
contribution in terms of power engineering, life-support-system 
work, and the organization of freight flow. All that, based on 
the totals for each period of operation of the station, should 
be assessed by a joint council. And each contribution is 
evaluated in money terms, and the jointly acquired information 
divided up on the basis of that. 
  Moreover, we will work to see to it that Russia gets the 
right not only to work independently on its autonomous module, 
but also to use all the station's equipment for its work. We 
have signed an intellectual property agreement that stipulates 
that information acquired jointly also belongs to all the 
countries that have taken part in acquiring it. 
  And the fears of the loss of the Flight Control Center and 
the Cosmonaut Training Center are unfounded. As we know, not 
only have Russian cosmonauts gone through training in the United 
States, but vice-versa. And it would also be impossible to close 
the Flight Control Center: it's a huge science center that's 
linked to more than just a station. 
  The alternative of creating a station with ESA is also 
unrealistic. The Europeans, no less than the Americans, operate 
on the principle of "money up front." Russia can't enter ESA, 
because we don't have the money for the entry share. 
  The orbit chosen for the station is based on the technical 
capabilities of the shuttles, but that doesn't mean that the 
United States is in a more advantageous position than we are, 
because they prefer to perform studies of the ground with 
satellites. 
  It's my hope that the agreement draft under discussion, 
after 
being signed by the President of Russia, will attach particular 
significance to the fulfillment of the obligations made in 
connection with it.
