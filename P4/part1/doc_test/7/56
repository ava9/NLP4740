<F P=106> [Article: "ESA Reorganizes Manned Flight and Launcher </F>
Programs"] 
  [Text] Paris--The ESA Council at its 112th meeting held 
22-23 March approved a reorganization of its manned flight and 
launcher programs that was ordered on 15 February. Since that 
time, details of the reorganization were worked out by the 
agency's director general, Mr. Jean-Marie Luton. 
  Mr. Jorg Feustel-Buechl will head the manned flight and 
microgravity programs, and in that capacity he will be 
responsible for all studies on ESA participation in the 
international R-Alpha station as well as negotiations with 
partners in the project, including the Americans, Russians, 
Canadians, Japanese, and the 14 ESA member countries. 
  Specifically, he will be responsible for the Columbus 
laboratory-module program which is to link up with Columbus, 
related systems (polar platform, etc.), and vehicles for 
transporting crew and cargo (Crew Transport Vehicle, or CTV, and 
Automatized Transport Vehicle, ATV), plus the precursor flights 
scheduled with the Russians between now and the year 2000. He 
will also oversee all technological aspects of the orbital 
rendezvous, the future European remote manipulator arm, and the 
EVA suits that ESA astronauts will wear, as well as operations 
of the European Astronaut Center at Cologne. 
  Mr. Fredrick Engstrom as launch director has been given 
oversight responsibility for the Ariane-5 heavy rocket program, 
technologies pertaining thereto, future spin-off launcher 
programs, and co-management (with the National Center for Space 
Studies) of all ESA utilization of the Guyana Space Center, a 
spokesman said.
