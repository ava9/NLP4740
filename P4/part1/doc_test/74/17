Singer-keyboard man Les McCann likes to make every set different, but one song 
slips in almost every time: "Compared to What," a duet with Eddie Harris from 
the 1969 album "Swiss Movement." 
</P>
<P>
McCann, who opened five nights at Elario's last night, may be growing weary of 
the tune, but that doesn't keep him from playing it. "I do it every night, no 
matter who I'm with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The late '60s song by Gene McDaniels has become McCann's anthem, but his sets 
at Elario's are bound to hold many surprises. McCann was an electric keyboard 
pioneer in the early 1970s -- he owned one of the first Fender Rhodes electric 
pianos -- and he continues to nurture a love of assorted exotic keyboards and 
synthesizers, which he uses to color his music. 
</P>
<P>
McCann's favorites among his more than a dozen albums as a leader don't include 
"Swiss Movement." One is the early 1970s "Layers," on which he played all of 
the instruments, with some electronic help. 
</P>
<P>
"I was one of the first to make an electronic album by myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another personal favorite was "Invitation to Openness," which included a 
27-minute meditation titled "The Lovers." 
</P>
<P>
Last year's album "Butterfly" was a departure for McCann. He sang lighter tunes 
to lush orchestral backgrounds at the suggestion of his producer, Richard 
Egizi. He pronounced the album an artistic success, although he probably won't 
repeat the format. He'll stay closer to jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his jazz work, McCann has been moonlighting as an actor. He has 
non-speaking parts in two commercials for U.S. Sprint, the long distance 
company. "I'm just sitting backstage, waiting for the big call," he said. 
Earlier this week, he recorded music for the "Matlock" television program and 
was invited to play a cameo role. He hasn't decided whether to accept. 
</P>
<P>
McCann is a hard man to pin down. 
</P>
<P>
"I rarely play standards. I never talk about what we play either. I never 
travel with charts." McCann's quartet includes trumpeter Jeff Elliott, bassist 
Del Atkins and drummer Tony St. James. 
</P>

There are San Diego angles to the Los Angeles Classic Jazz Festival taking 
place Friday through Monday at the Los Angeles airport Hilton and Marriott 
hotels. Included in the Saturday and Sunday lineup is The Chicago Six, the San 
Diego group that includes clarinetist Bobby Gordon. Gordon will also appear 
daily with the Condon Gang, which will re-create the 1940s and 1950s music of 
bands led by the late guitarist Eddie Condon, who owned several popular New 
York jazz clubs that bear his name. Original Condon trumpeter Ed Polcer will 
lead the Gang. 
</P>
<P>
Festival Director and trumpeter Wally Holmes learned his jazz at San Diego High 
School under history and jazz teacher Russell Warren in the mid-1940s. Holmes 
was also a member of Dick Harvey's Men of Note, the local band which won the 
regional semi-final of Look magazine's Swing Band Contest in 1946, and went on 
to place third in a national competition at Carnegie Hall. Chicago Six leader 
and bassist Bob Finch also cut his jazz chops at San Diego High during the 
'40s. Tickets for the festival are $60 for all events, $20 for Friday only, $30 
for Saturday or Sunday, and $15 for Monday.

Saxophonist Mark Lessman's career is picking up steam. His self-produced "More 
or Less" album is getting more radio play; KIFM upgraded the title track from 
"light" to "medium" rotation a month ago. WNUA-FM, the contemporary lites 
out-type station in Chicago, and The Wave (KTWV-FM) in Los Angeles are also 
playing it regularly, Lessman reports. He's working with Fattburger drummer 
Kevin Koch on a demo tape of songs for an album he hopes to record later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday night, the Mark Lessman Band made its Los Angeles debut at the Bon 
Appetit in Westwood. Lessman will spend October in Chicago, where his son 
lives, and where he hopes to establish music industry contacts so that he can 
spend part of each year there. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a summer full of surprises. Singer/pianist Harry Connick and his 
rhythm section joined Lessman on stage at Humphrey's, the restaurant and jazz 
club, for a version of "Superstitious" following Connick's July 8 shows at 
Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay. Later in July, singer Michael Franks' rhythm 
section took the club's stage for a short set of standards with Lessman. 
Lessman and his band play the B St. Cafe &amp; Bar downtown tonight through 
Saturday night, and they'll be at Humphrey's Sunday and Monday nights through 
September.

Since the beginning of her career, singer Etta James has belted out salty, 
no-holds-barred blues and soul. Her first single, "Roll With Me Henry," was 
banned in several parts of the country in 1954 because of its thinly veiled 
sexual innuendos. She hasn't lost any spunk: Her new album is fittingly titled 
"Stickin' to My Guns." James opens a September tour of the West Coast with a 
7:30 show next Wednesday night at Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay, backed by her 
nine-piece Roots Band.

RIFFS: The Beach House restaurant in Mission Beach presents its last three 
nights of jazz with guitarists Dan Papaila and Art Johnson tonight and Friday 
night and pianist Al Daniels Saturday night. "Almost always, the musicians were 
playing to an empty room. We didn't expect to make money from the music, but we 
could only subsidize if for so long," said Linda Jenkins, who owns the 
restaurant with her husband Clyde. The restaurant opened in June of last year, 
and Denver-based jazz singer Ellyn Rucker inaugurated jazz in the tiny bar the 
following month. She returned for several weeks this summer. Jenkins said 
Rucker may return next summer.

Pianist Jimmy Corsaro teams up with longtime musical partner, singer Sharon 
Andrews, for this afternoon's "Jazz After Work" concert on the steps of the San 
Diego Museum of Art in Balboa Park from 4:30 to 6:30. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at the Horton Grand Hotel downtown, flutist Holly Hofmann plays 
her last local date before leaving Saturday for an East Coast tour. She'll play 
clubs and festivals in Florida, North Carolina, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. 
Locals Bob Magnusson and Mike Wofford and Los Angeles drummer Sherman Ferguson 
will join her for the Jazz Charlotte festival in Charlotte, NC. Tomorrow night, 
she'll work with pianist Randy Porter, bassist Bob Magnusson and drummer Tim 
McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Joe Pass is the main attraction on this Saturday night's "Club Date" 
program on KPBS-TV at 11:30, airing again Monday night at 11:30. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist and songwriter Richard Glick plays jazz, ragtime and blues Friday 
night at 8 at Words &amp; Music bookstore in Hillcrest. Owner Dorothy Griska 
has the store up for sale. It's losing money. Asking price: $77,000.
