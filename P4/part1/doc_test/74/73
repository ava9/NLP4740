John McLaughlin has had so many achievements in his long career that's its hard 
to imagine him finding another peak to climb. Yet his current trio -- with 
Trilock Gurtu on percussion and Kai Eckhard on bass -- is producing music 
easily in a class with some of his finest past accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at the Golden Bear in Huntington Beach in what was, regretably, 
the group's only recent local appearance, McLaughlin and his associates played 
a set that bristled with creative interaction. 
</P>
<P>
The connections between the players were both intuitive and visual. Gurtu sat 
on the floor, Indian drummer-style, behind a cymbal-rich collection of 
instruments. His movements never seemed to stop, touching, stroking and 
striking his various implements -- a mad scientist of percussion, black hair 
flying, mustache bristling, eyes sparkling. On the opposite side of the stage 
McLaughlin -- cooler-looking, smiling, more laid-back -- worked his acoustic 
guitar, constantly reaching out to make electric eye contact with Gurtu and 
Eckhard. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin mixed rapid-fire, Al DiMeola-like runs with snap-crackle chording 
and soaringly lyrical melody lines. Yet, as abstract as some of his lines were, 
he could, on a piece like "One-Night Stand," abruptly shift gears into a series 
of hard-swinging, body moving, funk/soul-driven choruses. 
</P>
<P>
Gurtu's work verged on the remarkable. Firmly based in the extremely complex 
rhythms of Indian classical music, he demonstrated an equally masterful command 
of Western jazz drumming. Bassist Eckhard devoted himself, for the most part, 
to a supporting role, balancing the other players' solo flights with a solid 
rhythmic foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The net result was an exquisite evening of contemporary jazz. The McLaughlin 
trio demonstrated how easily jazz can incorporate a colorful assemblage of 
styles, influences and attitudes under its mantle of creativity. And that's 
exactly the message McLaughlin has been working on -- with continuing 
effectiveness -- for years. DON HECKMAN
