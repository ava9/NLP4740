You think you were busy before Christmas. Singer Stephanie Haynes, who lives in 
San Juan Capistrano, says she traveled "about 600 miles" making gigs during one 
week in December, with a club date in Rancho Cucamonga on Sunday, the grand 
opening of a Japanese nightclub in Torrance on Tuesday, a stop at Chadney's in 
Burbank on Wednesday and a weekend engagement at a new nightspot, Central Park 
West, in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
The following week found her doing three nights in the Sheraton San Pedro's 
Stingaree Gulch room with pianist Gildo Mahones. Talk about roadwork. She's 
back in Orange County today at El Matador Restaurant in the Huntington Harbour 
Mall with bassist Luther Hughes, keyboardist David Garfield and drummer Paul 
Kreibich. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there's good reason why she's in such demand. Her warm tone, smart 
sense of phrasing and a huge repertoire of jazz standards has won her 
comparison to singers such as Irene Kral and Sarah Vaughan. "I've listened to 
both of them a lot, but I don't consciously try to sing in their style," Haynes 
said last weekend. "I think people hear certain qualities in my voice that 
remind them of Kral, but your sound is God given. You can't really change it." 
(And as for Vaughan? "Nobody has a voice like that.") 
</P>
<P>
Singing came late to Haynes, who originally had designs on being a classical 
flutist. But while studying the instrument at UC Santa Barbara, she began 
hanging out with musicians who were into jazz and who played for parties and 
dances. "They asked me if I could sing," she recalls, "and before long, I was 
getting up to sing the only two songs I knew the words to: 'Misty' and 'Satin 
Doll.' " 
</P>
<P>
After moving to Albuquerque in the early '70s, she began working the local 
scene. She returned to Southern California in 1974 and since has appeared in 
clubs, restaurants and hotels all over the area. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no real effort involved for me to become a singer," she said. 
"Having a background in instrumental music made it easy. Singers have a pretty 
bad reputation as musicians, but I had all the basics, how to count, how to 
stay in key. . . ." She said she has no desire to return to the flute. "I've 
never had the desire to play jazz on the flute. I've tried it and know how it 
should sound, but I've got all that classical training to overcome. I hear 
myself and say: 'No, that's not going to do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Haynes has come a long way from the days when "Misty" and "Satin Doll" were the 
only songs she knew. The most recent of her two recordings, 1988's "Here's That 
Rainy Day" (on Trend/Discovery with keyboardist Cedar Walton, bassist Al 
McKibbon and drummer Billy Higgins) is a collection of Jimmy Van Heusen tunes 
that includes well-known numbers such as "It Could Happen to You" and "Darn 
That Dream" alongside such lesser known vehicles as "I Could Have Told You." 
Live, she mixes familiar warhorses -- "I'm Old Fashioned," Duke Ellington's "I 
Didn't Know About You" -- with Brazilian numbers such as Jobim's "No More 
Blues." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, she's been looking more to the Brazilians for material. "There's a 
whole genre of modern Brazilian music that doesn't have the exposure it should 
have," she said, citing composer-performers Ivan Lins, Milton Nascimento and 
Leny Andrade, a singer who because of her scat skills often is called the 
Brazilian Ella. "I'm open to any kind of music that sounds good to me. But 
nothing sounds good to me unless it's coming out of the jazz tradition or it's 
Brazilian. I hear pop music -- you can't avoid it these days -- but I don't 
hear any that I like." 
</P>
<P>
She thinks taste in music is a function of age. "The young haven't been exposed 
to this kind of music; they don't have a consciousness of jazz being different 
from any other form of entertainment. That has to be taught, but where do they 
get the instruction? They'll pay attention to rock bands because they are blown 
away by the volume and can involve themselves by dancing. But everything else 
remains dressing for socializing, certainly not for listening." 
</P>
<P>
Haynes will be going into the studio in January with pianist Alan Broadbent, 
bassist Putter Smith and drummer Kreibich to record more jazz standards. On tap 
are Freddie Hubbard's "Up Jump Spring," Sonny Rollins "Pentup House" and Benny 
Golson's "Whisper Not" (with lyrics by Leonard Feather). She'll also begin an 
open-ended, five-day-a-week engagement at Ron's in Palm Desert on Jan. 3 (a 
stint at Ron's in Laguna Beach, with bassist Hughes, lasted 2 1/2 years). It 
looks like, for Stephanie Haynes, next month will be as busy as this one.
