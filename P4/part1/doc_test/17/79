NOBODY becomes president of the US by accident or acclamation. Even those
vice-presidents who have inherited the job by dint of resignation, natural
death or assassination have been ambitious and successful enough to put
themselves a heartbeat away from the Oval Office and thus to lay reasonable
claim to the position.
William Jefferson Clinton, born Blythe, still only 46 years old, has been
running for president for a very long time. His has been a career never
removed from politics and government and, if each step along his long road
from a modest beginning in Hope, Arkansas, has not been entirely
predictable, there is no question about his devotion to his chosen trade,
nor about his ultimate goal.
Mr Clinton's father was killed in an accident three months before he was
born and his grandparents were influential in his early years as his mother
earned additional nursing qualifications away from home. She remarried and
he and his brother had a difficult relationship with their stepfather, who
suffered from alcoholism. Bill was educated at state schools in Arkansas.
His political interests were apparent early. As a teenager he shook hands in
the White House with John Kennedy and preserved a filmed record. At 23 he
wrote to his draft board that he was registering for military service
because he wanted to preserve his 'political viability'. He was in the thick
of the civil rights movement as an undergraduate in Washington, demonstrated
against the Vietnam war in London, and helped organise Texas for George
McGovern in 1972.
He was attorney general of his state in his 20s and governor by the time he
was 32, one of the youngest ever to assume such a position.
Defeated after one two-year term, he went back to the drawing board, saw
what he had done wrong and won re-election, a more pragmatic, less
confrontational politician. He began to seek to change the balance of power
inside the national Democratic party, mostly through his leading role in the
resolutely centrist - and southern dominated - Democratic Leadership
Conference.
In the summer of 1987, when he announced he would not seek the Democratic
presidential nomination the following year, he admitted he had his eye on
the presidency some day. Until a surprisingly poor keynote address at the
Democratic convention of 1988, he was considered one of the rising stars of
his party. In 1989, he contemplated not seeking re-election as governor, so
as to devote himself exclusively to a run at the presidency.
In the back of his mind was undoubtedly the thought that although Arkansas
had produced conspicuous figures on Capitol Hill - J. William Fulbright,
legendary chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, and Wilbur
Mills, doyen of ways and means in the House, for example - it had not placed
anybody on a national ticket since 1928, and then in the junior position.
There was also the feeling that Jimmy Carter had given obscure southern
governors a bad name. But Mr Clinton stuck with his state. He is now the
longest serving governor in the nation. He was not rated in the first tier
of Democratic aspirants 15 months ago but, one by one, the party
heavyweights declined to take on President George Bush, then immensely
popular, leaving Mr Clinton the best prepared and the best organised of a
disparate crew.
By the start of this year, he had earned the position of front runner - some
say he was 'anointed' such by a favourably disposed media - and the primary
season demonstrated that the early judgment was not misplaced. His
determination was more than evident as he overcame waves of charges about
his personal behaviour.
Both then, and during the campaign proper, he has been the subject of
scrutiny to an unprecedented extent, to the point that it cannot be said of
him, as it was of Mr Carter, that he comes to the presidency a closed or
under-read book. This does not mean that it is possible to predict with
great precision how he will perform and what he will do as president, but
certain salient characteristics are apparent.
His intelligence, for example, is not in dispute. Georgetown, Oxford as a
Rhodes Scholar and Yale Law School constitute a substantial academic
pedigree, particularly for a small-town youth from a state like Arkansas.
His wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, from suburban Chicago, whom he married in
1975, is of a comparable intellectual stature: she was first in her class at
Wellesley, also Yale Law School, and subsequently a successful advocate with
the most influential law firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, and as a policy
activist on issues such as children's rights.
The common view is that she is more liberal than her husband. She was known
socially and professionally by her maiden name until after Mr Clinton's
first defeat in Arkansas. But it cannot be said, after all they have been
through this year, that they do not form a formidable partnership.
For political reasons, Mrs Clinton has taken a more deferential role in
public in recent months but she is likely to be a power in the White House,
perhaps along the lines of Eleanor Roosevelt. Though more legally qualified
to serve as attorney general than was Robert Kennedy, appointed to the post
by his brother, a cabinet position for her is unlikely.
Both Mr Clinton and his wife are 'policy wonks' - they like to get into the
interstices of policy, to argue fine points into the dead of night and to
try to find the right mix of what may be contrary proposals. Mr Carter had
similar tendencies, successfully deployed during Camp David.
Mr Clinton, however, comes to the White House with much greater familiarity
of most of the main issues of the day than could be said of Mr Carter 16
years ago, largely because of the reforms in education, training and health
that he has introduced in Arkansas.
He seems to like the presentation of different points of view and subsequent
reconciliation of those differences. It may be a help that he clearly is
beholden to few, if any, of the traditional power blocs inside his party,
and saddled with little personal ideological baggage, beyond the conviction
that government, properly applied, can be good for the nation. In this
respect he is very much the product of his formative years - the 1960s - and
the antithesis of the Reagan-Bush era.
His southernness is an important ingredient in his make-up. There remains a
neighbourliness to the south which requires politicians to keep their feet
on the ground, particularly in smaller states such as Arkansas. It certainly
was the case throughout the long campaign that Mr Clinton, far more than his
Democratic rivals and President Bush, seemed able to understand and
articulate the concerns of average people.
Mr Clinton grew up in the south at a time of huge social and economic
change. Like many of his generation from the region, he is at ease with
minorities, especially blacks.
He sends his daughter, Chelsea, to a thoroughly integrated state school. He
sensed that to take on the Rev Jesse Jackson was not necessarily to
sacrifice black support, a calculation that Walter Mondale and Michael
Dukakis, the previous Democratic candidates, never felt confident enough to
make. The Baptist rhythms of his speech, when he is on form, are not an
artifice.
The contemporary southern heritage mixes social liberalism with financial
conservatism. Mr Clinton has been obliged by state law for his 12 years as
governor to balance the Arkansas budget. This does not translate into
support for the constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget, but
it does mean that he is accustomed to taking tough budgetary decisions and
it does mean that he favours the 'line item' veto, whereby offending
elements in an omnibus bill may be identified and struck out.
The south's progress over the last 25 years has also been predicated on the
creation of a favourable climate for the private sector, in which Arkansas
under Mr Clinton's direction has been no exception. He prefers co-operation,
not confrontation, between business and government and has praised the
German and Japanese models in this respect. Conventional liberals are uneasy
with his willingness to accommodate business at the expense, they allege, of
the environment and the workforce.
Southerners have also been traditionally 'conservative' on foreign policy
issues, including support for a strong military. Mr Clinton obviously lacks
formal foreign policy experience, and he did not exactly encourage
discussion of foreign policy in the campaign, other than to pick holes in
the Bush record where necessary and to support it where appropriate. But
this does not denote either a lack of interest or knowledge in the world
outside. Indeed he seems to understand that the end of the cold war offers
the opportunity for new approaches, including the evolution towards a
leaner, more flexible military. His foreign policy advisers have been
noteably mainstream.
As a Democrat, therefore, he is different in the sense that he does not
appear to be either isolationist or protectionist, the prevalent trends in
the party for much of the last dozen years. But this does make him easier to
read. He certainly comes to the office having spoken volumes about every
known subject but, perhaps because of the very profusion of his words, with
some of the contradictions as evident as some of the consistencies.
An Arkansas mafia has been with him over the years, but it is nothing like
as large nor as central as Mr Carter's Georgian crew and is supplemented by
his old academic friends, including several Rhodes Scholars, and by his
political network.
The style, therefore, that Mr Clinton may bring to Washington is likely to
be eclectic. He likes popular music, answers to the nickname Elvis and has
played the saxophone on late night television; he hits golf balls and goes
running, the latter because of a tendency to gain weight; his taste in
literature is said to be catholic: he likes a social drink and plays cards.
But mostly he likes to talk and mostly about what makes government work -
and very late into the night.
