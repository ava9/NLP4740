</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howard Allen Schneiderman, who led Monsanto Co., UC Irvine and St. Louis' 
Washington University in the development of biotechnology and genetic 
engineering, has died. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
Schneiderman died Wednesday at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis after suffering 
from leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
He was chief chemist and senior vice president of research and development at 
Monsanto. He had been dean of the School of Biological Sciences at UC Irvine 
before going on leave to join Monsanto and Washington University of St. Louis 
in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, he was awarded the UCI Medal, highest honor of the Irvine campus, for 
significant contributions to the university's development. In nine years at 
Irvine, Schneiderman was credited with increasing the university's research 
funding, recruiting top professors and guiding expansion of the university's 
Developmental Biology Center. 
</P>
<P>
He also was named by former President Ronald Reagan to the National Science 
Board, the policy-making arm of the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Schneiderman held central roles in both the arena of academic research and 
in the industrial sector," said Frank Press, president of the National Academy 
of Sciences. "He knew that American industry needed to be competitive and the 
government policies necessary to achieve the goal. He was a major figure in 
American science." 
</P>
<P>
Schneiderman was teaching at UC Irvine when he was elected to the National 
Academy of Sciences, the highest accolade for U.S. scientists. Informed of the 
honor by then-Chancellor Daniel G. Aldrich Jr. at a surprise champagne party, 
the low-key Schneiderman reacted: 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my goodness gracious Jones! I'm really proud of this." 
</P>
<P>
He was elected to the academy for his studies and research in the fields of 
insect physiology, endocrinology and development. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Schneiderman told his academic colleagues that his years at 
Irvine had been "the most productive years of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Schneiderman joined Monsanto under a $62-milllion joint research partnership 
between the company and Washington University -- which has led to more than 40 
patents. 
</P>
<P>
Under his leadership, Monsanto built its Life Sciences Research Center for 
Biotechnology Research in Chesterfield and moved into the technology of mixing 
genes from different species to develop new crops, veterinary drugs and other 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Richard J. Mahoney, chairman and chief executive officer at Monsanto, said: 
"Howard, more than anyone, helped set a direction for the company in the 
biological sciences, which is serving us extremely well. We are fortunate that 
the course he helped set will continue to guide Monsanto well into the 21st 
Century. We will miss him deeply." 
</P>
<P>
Schneiderman was the author of more than 200 published papers on scientific 
subjects, including developmental biology and genetics, insect biochemistry and 
plant growth, and was an adjunct professor at Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
Schneiderman was born in New York. He got his bachelor's degree from Swarthmore 
College and both his master's degree in zoology and doctoral degree in 
physiology from Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Audrey; a son, John, of Irvine and a daughter, 
Anne, of Ithaca, N.Y.
