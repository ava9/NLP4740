Kurosawa to be Honored: Japanese film maker Akira Kurosawa will receive an 
honorary award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences at the 62nd 
Annual Academy Awards show on March 26. Kurosawa, 79, will be recognized "for 
his cinematic accomplishments that have inspired, delighted, enriched and 
entertained worldwide audiences and influenced film makers throughout the 
world." Kurosawa's 1951 production of "Rashomon" won the Oscar for Best Foreign 
Language Film and is generally credited with turning the western world's 
attention to the work of Japanese film makers. Shauna Snow
