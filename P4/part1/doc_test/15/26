Curtistina Dawkins enrolled in Compton Community College in 1963, but dropped 
out after a few weeks to get a job to help her parents, seven sisters and three 
brothers. 
</P>
<P>
But Dawkins never gave up her dream of returning to college. In June, she 
graduated with high honors, earning a 3.66 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
"I hated school as a child. The teacher would tell me to find a quiet place at 
home to study, but that was unrealistic with eight girls sleeping in one room," 
Dawkins said. Twenty- seven years after dropping out, Dawkins was the student 
keynote speaker at the college's 1990 commencement. "You're never too young to 
dream a dream, and you're never too old to see that dream come to pass," the 
44-year-old mother and grandmother told the 250 graduates. 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins received some of the loudest applause from more than 40 relatives in 
attendance. The group included her parents, eight of her siblings, her husband 
George, and the couple's four children and two grandchildren. She is the first 
family member to graduate from college. 
</P>
<P>
Her sister, Cynthia Scott, 40, plans to be the second family member to get a 
college degree. Scott actually enrolled at Compton before Dawkins, but has been 
on maternity leave, Dawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins has enrolled at Cal State Dominguez Hills and intends to get a 
bachelor's degree in psychology. Eventually, she plans to work as a marriage, 
family and child counselor. Meanwhile, Dawkins will continue as associate 
minister at the Christian Community Foursquare Church in Compton. The pastor is 
her husband.

<P>
James L. Ash Jr., president of Whittier College, has been appointed chairman of

educational research and development center, which will conduct a five-year 
research project on how to improve education in the nation's colleges and 
universities. A site for the center has not been selected. The center will 
receive a $1-million federal research grant each year.
