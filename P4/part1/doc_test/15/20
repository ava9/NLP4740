MR Robin Leigh-Pemberton, outgoing governor of the Bank of England, is one
of four life peers created in today's Queen's Birthday honours list. Another
is Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, the academic and writer.
Mr Samuel Brittan, the Financial Times's principal economic commentator and
an assistant editor, receives a knighthood for services to economic
journalism. Mr David Buchan, head of the FT's Paris bureau, receives an OBE
for services to journalism.
Today's list reflects a further stage of Mr John Major's incremental reform
of the honours system to give greater recognition to voluntary and community
service. It includes honours for those involved in humanitarian relief work
in former Yugoslavia.
Lieutenant Colonel Bob Stewart, who commanded British troops in Bosnia, was
awarded a Distinguished Service Order.
The greater emphasis on a wider contribution to the community was
highlighted in some of the awards to those in business and commerce, as well
as those for charitable services.
Among those receiving knighthoods were Mr Robin Biggam, chairman of BICC,
the cable and construction group; Mr Ronald Miller, chairman of Dawson
International, the textile group and Mr Jim Birrell, chief executive of
Halifax Building Society.
While this is the first list in which the British Empire Medal - the lowest
grade of honour - does not appear, other reforms promised by Mr Major in
March will have to await future lists.
The New Year's honours list will be the first for which people can write in
to the prime minister's office to nominate someone. So far more than 10,000
nomination forms have been sent out and 6,000 have been returned. The
proportion of awards to state servants was broadly in line with previous
lists, though Downing Street said that now no official was nominated
automatically.
Political honours, however, were distributed at Westminster rather more
sparsely than usual. Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, and Sir George
Young, housing minister, both become privy counsellors, but only two
Conservative backbenchers, Mr Ralph Howell and Mr David Knox, receive
knighthoods.
Among the customary awards to artists and entertainers are the other two
life peers: Sir Richard Attenborough, the actor and film director, and Sir
Yehudi Menuhin, the violinist and conductor. Miss Thora Hird, the actress,
and Miss Muriel Spark, the author, both become Dames.
Mr Nicholas Colchester, deputy editor of the Economist and former foreign
editor of the FT, receives an OBE for services to journalism.
In what may be a sign of the times, relatively few awards went to
footballers and cricketers. Mr Andy Roxburgh, the Scottish football team
manager receives the OBE. Mr Ray Wilkins, the former England soccer player,
receives the MBE as does Mr Harold Larwood, a fast bowler who last played
for England in the controversial 1932-33 'Bodyline' Ashes series against
Australia.
