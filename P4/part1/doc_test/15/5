Lauding the Johnsons: Performing arts supporters Roger and Janice Johnson were 
honored by the Volunteer Center of Orange County last week when they received 
its coveted Giving is Living Award. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of guests squeezed into the Hyatt Regency Irvine to honor the couple. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Johnson is on the Orange County Performing Arts Center's board of 
directors. His wife is chairwoman of the Guilds of the Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Kathryn Thompson, attending with husband Gus Owen, presented the 
award to the couple whose names have become synonymous with the local 
performing arts scene. 
</P>
<P>
Janice Johnson thanked the crowd for their gift of friendship. "Many of the 
people in this room have done as much, perhaps even more," she said. "Most of 
the friendships I have were made doing volunteer work. Those people are as much 
a part of my life as volunteering is." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Johnson told guests that the arts were headed for challenging times. He 
said he hoped people would continue to give. When giving is difficult, "that's 
when it's needed most." 
</P>
<P>
On the scene: Center chairman William Lyon with his wife, Willa Dean; Janice's 
mother, Barbara Rowlands; her brother, Rick Rowlands; and the Johnsons' 
children -- Mary Cantor with her husband, Michael, and Eric Johnson with his 
wife, Gloria.
