Capt. Will C. Rogers III was awarded the Legion of Merit on Saturday, a top 
military honor, as he stepped down from command of the Vincennes, a 
guided-missile cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
He has been reassigned to shore duty in what Navy officials describe as a 
routine transfer. 
</P>
<P>
The Vincennes created an international furor last July when it mistakenly shot 
down an Iranian airliner in the Persian Gulf during a firefight with seven 
Iranian gunboats, killing all 290 people on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking from the deck of the ship, Rogers lashed out against the "rabid 
ideology" of terrorists and the "lack of courage" of those who give in to 
terrorist actions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ovation for Wife 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Sharon, seated among 500 spectators on the pier next to the ship, 
drew a standing ovation from the crowd Saturday as she accepted a bouquet of 
red roses from the Navy at the change-of-command ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, she survived a suspected terrorist bomb attack as she drove to her 
teaching job in La Jolla. Several days later, she was fired by administrators 
of the exclusive La Jolla Country Day School, who feared her presence posed a 
security threat to the children. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators have speculated that the pipe bombs that destroyed her 
van may have been planted in retaliation for the downing of the civilian 
airliner. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony took place amid unusually tight security at the 32nd Street Naval 
Station. Only invited guests were allowed on the base, and all had to pass 
through two security checks and a metal detector. The Rogerses remain under the 
constant protection of the Naval Investigative Service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pupils as Guests 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests were a number of children from the fourth-grade class Sharon 
Rogers taught at La Jolla Country Day School. Giggling and smiling, the 
children gathered around her before the ceremony. Sharon Rogers has not 
returned to the school since the bombing incident and has reached a $135,000 
settlement with its administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers called his wife "a very brave and courageous lady," and described her 
reaction on the morning her van exploded at a La Jolla intersection. 
</P>
<P>
"She literally rode the fireball out of the vehicle, sprinted to the curb, 
combed the shrapnel from her hair and asked a construction worker to call and 
inform me that she had experienced a minor mechanical difficulty," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I arrived, she was most concerned, as her lesson plans were in flames and 
she was going to be late for school." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Posted to Point Loma 
</P>
<P>
Rogers has been reassigned as commander of the Tactical Development and 
Training Group based at Point Loma. He will be replaced on the Vincennes by 
Capt. Robert B. Lynch, who previously was assigned to the Naval Military 
Personnel Command. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers was given the Legion of Merit award for his performance as commanding 
officer of the Vincennes, to which he was assigned in April, 1987. A letter 
written on behalf of President Bush by Navy Sec. H. Lawrence Garrett III 
described Rogers' "superb professionalism, confidence and exceptional 
leadership and dedication to excellence." 
</P>
<P>
During the ship's tour in the Persian Gulf, Rogers' "tactical skills and calm 
direction enabled his crew to successfully engage seven heavily armed 
high-speed Iranian surface craft" attacking the Vincennes in "confined and 
confused waters," the letter stated. "As a result, five craft were destroyed 
and two retreated." 
</P>
<P>
The letter made no mention of the Iranian airliner, which Rogers ordered shot 
down that day in the mistaken belief that it was an Iranian fighter plane. 
Rogers and his crew were cleared of any responsibility for the mistake in a 
Defense Department investigation last year.
