Don Johnston remembers "the incident" in vivid detail. 
</P>
<P>
It was a routine call last January to investigate a forgery attempt at the 
Security Pacific Bank in El Monte. "It's not the sort of call on which you'd 
expect violence," the El Monte police officer said. 
</P>
<P>
A husky man with rust-colored hair, Johnston spotted the suspect from the 
bank's foyer. "I saw him turn and look at me, with a real nervous, excited look 
on his face," Johnston recalled. "He immediately started walking towards me." 
</P>
<P>
Using a bank customer as a shield, the suspect pulled a handgun from his belt 
and headed for the door. "I couldn't shoot because the other man was in the 
way," Johnston said. "With my left hand, I pushed the customer out of the way. 
At that exact moment, I got shot." 
</P>
<P>
The suspect fired three times, hitting Johnston once in the throat and blasting 
the bank's glass door to smithereens. "I was lying there and it seemed like 
forever that the glass was falling on me." 
</P>
<P>
"The incident" -- as he and his wife, Ruth, sometimes numbly refer to the 
shooting -- thrust Johnston into a nightmare world, with the veteran police 
officer facing the very real possibility that he would spend the rest of his 
life in a wheelchair, paralyzed from the chest down and unable to speak. 
</P>
<P>
Newly married, an amateur drummer with the rich baritone of a disc jockey, a 
cop who had volunteered long hours to provide encouragement to needy El Monte 
children, Johnston was suddenly a paraplegic who needed the assistance of two 
men to carry him to his second-floor apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The last seven months have been a roller-coaster ride for the Johnstons, from 
the first awful words of a County/USC Medical Center neurologist telling them 
that Johnston would never walk again to the moment, a month later, when 
Johnston succeeded in moving his big toe, producing a twitching motion so faint 
that his wife had to bend close to see it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I woke up the whole hospital wing when that happened," Ruth Johnston 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Johnston, 35, has defied the early prognoses, teaching himself to 
talk in the raspy voice of movie character "Freddy Krueger" despite a shattered 
larynx and, through a regimen of laborious exercises, learning how to walk 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Johnston can maneuver down a sidewalk with a walker or two canes -- at 13% 
of normal speed, according to his therapists -- and he has walked up to 545 
feet without pausing. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it's the fight of my life," Johnston said last week, pausing 
briefly from a grueling series of leg exercises in the gym at Casa Colina, a 
rehabilitation hospital in Pomona. "Every bead of sweat takes me one step 
closer to my goal" of being able to walk normally. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the worst eventu-alities produce their own rewards -- good deeds from 
strangers and richer relationships with loved ones. Johnston has been the 
object of an outpouring of generosity from El Monte residents, who raised -- 
through banquets, car washes and a truck raffle -- enough money for a down 
payment on a house in Rialto, where the Johnstons now live. 
</P>
<P>
He received a Congressional Award of Merit and, recently, the R. G. Canning 
California Officer of the Year Award. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been a real inspiration to all of us," said El Monte Police Chief Wayne 
Clayton, who presented the Canning award two weeks ago in a Rose Bowl ceremony. 
Johnston "no doubt saved a man's life" when he pushed bank customer John Flores 
out of the line of fire, Clayton said. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a lot of courage," said Flores, 54, of El Monte, a clerk with the 
county assessor's office. "I would have run in the opposite direction." 
</P>
<P>
The injury also produced a deep, spiritual relationship with Ruth Johnston, 
whom he had married just four months before he was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old legal secretary still weeps bitterly when she recalls the first 
sight of her husband on an emergency room gurney. "When they finally let me in 
to see him, it was a shock," she said haltingly. "His whole body was bouncing 
in the bed from the trauma and his eyes were wide open like this." She makes 
eyes wide and unblinking. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston, certain he would die, managed to communicate his love to his wife. 
"Then we prayed together," Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet had struck two vertebrae in Johnston's neck, leaving bone splinters 
lodged near the spinal cord. The resultant swelling left him paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
"Telling a muscle to move and it won't -- that's very difficult to understand," 
said Johnston, whose alleged assailant, Nguyen Lu, was subsequently arrested 
and declared incompetent to stand trial. Lu, a 27-year-old Temple City man, is 
currently under observation at a state psychiatric facility. 
</P>
<P>
Therapists at Casa Colina painstakingly taught Johnston to transfer himself 
from bed to wheelchair, and how to shower and groom himself. Then, as it became 
apparent that he had sensation in his lower body, they began the arduous task 
of teaching him to walk. Johnston started on the parallel bars, dragging 
himself along for 30 feet with most of his weight resting on his arms, then he 
moved to the front-wheel walker. 
</P>
<P>
Three times a week now, he goes through his paces, maneuvering up a set of 
stairs in the Casa Colina gym or doing leg bends on a mat or just sitting down 
and standing up -- all under the cobra-like gaze of physical therapist Berni 
Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
Here he is, face down on a mat, pumping his left leg slowly up and down, as 
Rogers goads him along like a bodybuilding trainer at Muscle Beach. "OK, Don," 
she said as Johnston winced with the effort. "Give me two more. Just two more." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers acknowledged that Johnston is often in pain. There is a chaotic welter 
of signals rushing through his legs. "His nervous system interprets something 
like this," she said, running one finger lightly over an arm, "as pain. It's as 
if your leg has fallen asleep and you're feeling that burning, tingly 
sensation. That's what Don feels all the time." 
</P>
<P>
But Rogers is optimistic. Six months down the road, she sees Johnston walking, 
perhaps with a cane, at 50% of the "normal" walking speed of 300 feet per 
minute. "He's young and healthy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The injured man already has defied expectations, said Dr. Tae-Soon Kim, his 
physiatrist. "He's made remarkable gains, well beyond initial expectations." 
But only about 2% of those with spinal cord injuries recover fully. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect him to progress further," Kim said, "but as far as full recovery, 
that remains to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
Johnston attributes his progress to his belief in God. "But you can't sit back 
and expect God to do all the work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The son of retired El Monte Detective Loren (Corky) Johnston, the injured man 
said he expects eventually to go back to the department -- "whether at a desk 
job or whatever." His son from a previous marriage, Eric, 14, wants to sign on 
too. "I want to follow in his footsteps," the youth said last week. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how far he progresses, Johnston has already traveled a vast distance 
from the time six months ago when he was a mute, troubled hospital patient, his 
wife said. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Johnston recalls with crystal clarity the moment when the nightmare 
started to dissipate. As she rested in a hotel, doctors were removing a valve 
from Johnston's trachea. Until then, her only communication from her husband 
had been on a magnetized writing pad. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the best phone call I ever got," she said. "There was this funny Freddy 
Krueger voice on the other end. I said, 'Who is this?' and he said: 'Hi, honey. 
I love you.' "
