CRITIC'S NOTES: DIRECTORS GUILD OPTS FOR MOVIES ON THE SLICK LIST

Last year was a stunning time for movies, something you might not have gathered 
from the puzzling and borderline outrageous list of nominations from the 
Director Guild of America: Charles Crichton "A Fish Called Wanda"; Barry 
Levinson, "Rain Man"; Mike Nichols, "Working Girl"; Alan Parker, "Mississippi 
Burning," and Robert Zemeckis, "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
At first the list seems only a triumph of style over content or commercialism 
uber alles. It comes a little more into focus when you remember that the large 
percentage of the guild are from television and its sheltering environs, or, to 
put it another way, the relatively small percentage who are in movies alone. 
</P>
<P>
Every one of the films nominated fit a TV sensibility comfortably; three of 
them are pleasant, funny, hilarious. None of them strains us overmuch. They 
reduce complex situations to easily assimilated bites. Visually, they have 
strongly composed surfaces, almost as slickly beautiful as commercials. 
</P>
<P>
If it were it not for the dentist's-drill intensity of Dustin Hoffman's 
performance which electrifies "Rain Man," its story would be perilously close 
to a disease-of-the-week television movie. The deep-seated, stubborn objections 
that many critics have raised to "Mississippi Burning's" perversions of the 
truth are regularly brushed aside when a serious subject is melodramatized for 
TV. If "Working Girl" turned up as episodic television, Staten Islander Tess 
McGill vs. the corporate world, it would probably surprise no one. 
</P>
<P>
At year end, each of the critics' groups came up with a different winning film: 
"Accidental Tourist" from the New York Film Critics Assn.; "The Unbearable 
Lightness of Being" from the National Society of Film Critics; "Little Dorrit" 
from the Los Angeles Film Critics Assn. and "Mississippi Burning" from the 
National Board of Review. What this suggested was that the crop this year was 
so varied and so unusual and favorites from it were so hotly held that 
consensus was impossible. And missing from those lists were such directors as 
Francis Coppola ("Tucker") Martin Scorsese ("The Last Temptation of Christ") 
Stephen Frears ("Dangerous Liasons"), David Cronenberg ("Dead Ringers") and 
Clint Eastwood ("Bird"). 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant though some of their individual choices might be, overall the DGA's 
list is safe and strikingly mediocre. You might tuck Nichols ("Working Girl") 
into the 5 slot on a strong, gutsy list. It's charming to see Charlie Crichton 
recognized after all these years, although you might think that "A Fish Called 
Wanda" was more a writer's than a director's film. It's nice that Zemeckis' 
febrile intensity and the pure magic of his and his cohorts' achievements on 
"Roger Rabbit" were recognized. 
</P>
<P>
You might not expect the DGA to go out on a limb with "Dead Ringers," or "Women 
on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" or "The Last Temptation of Christ." But 
it's unsettling when a guild of what might be hoped to be leaders shies away 
from its strongest visionaries, the Scorseses, the Coppolas, the Cronenbergs, 
the Eastwoods, the Edzards. They have certainly embraced them in the past when 
they picked Bernardo Bertolucci, Steven Spielberg, Oliver Stone and, if you go 
back far enough, Francis Coppola. 
</P>
<P>
We won't really be able to tell which way the wind is blowing among the 
directors until the Academy nominations are announced on Feb. 15. But if 
slickness and an eye on the grosses is beginning to infect this body, it is a 
frightening portent.
