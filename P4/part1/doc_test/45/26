Gustav Holst began writing "The Planets" in 1914. Its first performance, five 
years later, was a symphonic celebration of planets Mercury through Neptune 
(Pluto wasn't discovered until 1930). The music is beautiful and grand -- but 
something is lacking. Despite its variety, there is no human adventure. The 
planets, in those days, were still "gods" -- remote, aloof in a separate, 
self-contained universe, hermetically sealed from human interaction or 
contamination. The solar system was a very large and inaccessible place for 
mortals. 
</P>
<P>
Now another piece of music has played out; the last note of Voyager's Neptune 
encounter fades into the vacuum as the spacecraft departs our solar system, to 
be succeeded in the public mind by the discordance of the Bay Area earthquake 
and Eastern European upheavals. But we come not to bury Voyager; rather to 
praise. The brief encounter with Neptune was not an ending but a prelude to a 
larger quest and a longer symphony. 
</P>
<P>
After Voyager, the gods no longer reign. The planets belong to humankind. 
</P>
<P>
The outer planets and their satellites were but tiny, pretty baubles in our 
skies before Voyager's flight to Neptune and beyond. Now they are worlds in 
their own right, concrete and beautiful in their gargantuan presence. 
</P>
<P>
Gustav Holst was born too early. How was he to know the adventure of the 
planets and man's place among them? There was no way then to experience, even 
vicariously through the eyes of a Voyager, the pastoral solitude of 
interplanetary cruising; the rolling, thundering crescendo of planetary 
encounter. 
</P>
<P>
I imagine him looking over our shoulders, following Voyager across the sky. 
NASA's Goldstone antenna, a white leviathan in the center of an empty desert 
stage, glows in a fading twilight, hard bright stars overhead, the silence of 
the horizon dropping away into pink-gray distance. Why is it that this sight 
and silence seems so much like music? Gustav, are you listening? Can you hear 
the slow-motion turning against the sky? 
</P>
<P>
It's time for a new musical genius to bring us a modern symphony of adventure 
among the planets, of man's place among the gods. Let us hear the chaos of 
departure from Earth's surly bonds, the basso profundo of planetary encounter. 
It's time for that symphony, and I hope someone will write it, because it is 
the beginning of a story of human drama of Wagnerian proportion. It will help 
to tell us where we are and where we're going. 
</P>
<P>
And where is that? "To the supermarket," some will say. "My feet are firmly 
planted on Earth, and I'm going to work, I'm going home, I'm going to the 
hospital to visit a friend. I need to tend my garden." 
</P>
<P>
Worthy activities, but our children, or perhaps our grandchildren, are going to 
live in space. The urge to explore and expand is inborn. We are going, sooner 
or later, because we have no choice. Cast aside any debates about manned versus 
unmanned space exploration. They are irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
As a species, we will begin by colonizing the solar system. We will break 
ourselves -- bodies and spirits -- on new shores, and we will regroup and 
plunge again, groping for dry land. Careers will be spent, lives lost in the 
quest. Music will help us mend, and drive us forward again. 
</P>
<P>
Many will not share our enthusiasm -- will not want to assume the hardships of 
pioneering. They are the equivalent of the Europeans who stayed behind, 
concerned with the problems of the Old World while explorers looked to the new. 
</P>
<P>
Let them be. Very few will be able to go, anyhow. We will need their help, a 
large home base for support while we explore and settle, until we are 
independent. And what will explorers do for our homeland, our mother Earth at 
that time? Probably the same thing that the United States of America did for 
England in 1776. Children have no responsibility to their parents; only to the 
children that follow. 
</P>
<P>
Voyager represents the beginning of a magic age. Its goodby to Neptune is our 
hello to the solar system. The journey will begin with small steps: footprints 
on Mars, new ones on the moon. Every step will be hard-fought, but eventually 
we will inhabit most of the solar neighborhood. At that point, we'll begin to 
get restless again -- we'll turn up our music and consider how to follow 
Voyager on a questing note, a trip to the stars.
