PLUTONIUM THREAT OF GALILEO PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I find it sadly ironic that soon after we marveled at the ability of the 
Voyager spacecraft to return images from Neptune, the Christic Institute and 
two other citizens groups have filed suit to block the launching of the Galileo 
probe to Jupiter (Part I, Sept. 28-29). If successful, this suit may halt the 
exploration of the outer solar system for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
The groups do not seem to consider rationally the risks involved in the launch. 
For there to any chance of radioactive release, a major disaster would have to 
take place during either the launch or the Earth flyby. Even if such a disaster 
occurs, the plutonium is so well encapsulated that an accidental release is 
virtually impossible. In the three previous failures of U.S. spacecraft using 
"radioisotope thermoelectric generators" (RTGs), only one released any 
radioactive material, and that was very finely distributed in the upper 
atmosphere. The other two, which used the new encapsulated design, released no 
radioactive material whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
Given these safety measures, the chances of a dangerous radioactive material 
release are extremely low. The risk is not zero, however, and so this hazard 
needs to be evaluated in comparison with other risks. Consider the number of 
people killed in auto accidents or plane crashes, not to mention natural 
disasters. Given the extremely low odds of a Galileo disaster and the small 
number of fatalities expected from an accident, why does the Christic Institute 
not concentrate upon airline safety or hurricane preparedness? I think Lanny 
Sinkin (a Christic Institute lawyer) answered this when he said, "Our real 
bottom line is, go find an alternative to plutonium." We have developed such a 
fear anything "nuclear" that it becomes impossible to consider the risks 
realistically; we fall victim to nuclear paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
While there are many valid concerns regarding nuclear power here on Earth, or 
even in Earth orbit, a long-range planetary probe faces unique problems. At the 
distance of Jupiter, Galileo will receive only 4% as much sunlight as it would 
at Earth, which would necessitate impossibly large solar panels. Chemical 
batteries and fuel cells would not last the required 8-10 years. A nuclear 
source is the only viable option for the foreseeable future. Given the small 
risks involved, the use of plutonium RTGs seems justified on Galileo, and on 
planned missions such as the Ulysses solar mission, and the mission to Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
One can only imagine how the exploration of the Americas would have been 
impeded if 15th Century Europeans had an irrational fear of the magnetic 
compass. Let us hope that our nuclear fears do not lead us to close the door on 
much of the solar system.
