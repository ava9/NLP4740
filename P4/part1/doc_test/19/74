  [Text] New Delhi, 7 Feb -- Dalai Lama XIV, Nobel Peace 
Prize awardee (for 1989) and supreme leader of Tibetan Buddhism, 
gave an interview to MAINICHI SHIMBUN deputy chief editor, 
Masato Kitamura, in New Delhi on 7 February. During the 
interview, the Dalai Lama -- stressing a realistic line -- said 
that complete independence for Tibet has become quite 
impossible, and the future of Tibet lies in the federation of a 
Tibetan autonomous government with the PRC Government. It will 
be interesting to see how the Chinese government will react to 
the Dalai Lama's proposal for an autonomous Tibetan government 
and federation. 
  The Dalai Lama stated, "The autonomous government delegates 
its powers in relation to foreign policy and defense to China." 
He disclosed that China has already been unofficially informed 
of this plan. He also indicated that officials of the Tibetan 
government in exile have been making behind-the-scenes contacts 
with the Chinese leadership, and certain developments can be 
expected in the near future. 
  However, regarding the frequent anti-China demonstrations in 
the Tibet Autonomous Region presently under PRC rule, the Dalai 
Lama said this is "a reflection of serious violations of human 
rights." He urged Western nations to continue to pay serious 
attention to the violations of human rights occurring in Tibet. 
  Furthermore, the Dalai Lama expressed serious concern about 
the environmental problem in Tibet, claiming that due to the 
Chinese government's program for rapid economic development in 
the Tibet Autonomous Region, there has been serious erosion of 
top soil, and large scale destruction of the natural 
environment. Linpoche [name as published], vice chairman of the 
Tibetan Parliament in exile, who was also present at the 
interview, criticized the PRC Government's deforestation. He 
said the total area of forest in Tibet, which was 220,000 square 
km in 1949, had diminished to 130,000 square km in 1985, and 
this continues to decrease. 
  The Dalai Lama also strongly protested China's "cultural 
genocide," claiming Tibetan culture, which has a history of its 
own centering on Buddhism, is deteriorating gradually owing to 
the PRC Government's uniform school education in the Tibet 
Autonomous Region.
