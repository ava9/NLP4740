<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has canceled a planned visit to Oslo for 
the presentation of his Nobel Peace Prize, Tass news agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
Tass quoted the Soviet president's press office as saying plans to attend the 
Dec. 10 presentation were changed because of the "crucial situation in the 
country and the president's preoccupation with affairs that occupy his constant 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, awarded the Peace Prize for his reforms that allowed the end of the 
Cold War and the flourishing of democratic movements in Eastern Europe, has 
been criticized at home for devoting too much time to foreign affairs and 
overseas trips while the Soviet Union suffers serious shortages and domestic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped in Moscow that the Nobel committee will understand the reason for 
this postponement and agree to present the prize at a later date," Tass said.
