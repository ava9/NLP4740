IN MEMORIUM: One of the most extensive commemorations of Albert Schweitzer's 
death 25 years ago will be in Orange at Chapman College. . . . Abetted by two 
Schweitzerphiles -- an alumna, the late Valerie Scudder of the potato chip 
family, and history professor Kurt Bergel -- the campus has a Schweitzer Mall, 
Schweitzer "think corners," a permanent Schweitzer exhibit and a small 
Schweitzer institute. . . . Now it also has a free-to-the-public Schweitzer 
convocation scheduled for Sept. 7 and 8 and including lectures, music, dance, 
poetry and films. Schweitzer, best known for his African mission hospital, won 
the Nobel Peace Prize in '52. Jeffrey A. Perlman and Kristina Lindgren
