Mother Teresa underwent surgery Friday to receive a pacemaker, and hundreds of 
nuns of her Missionaries of Charity prayed for her recovery. 
</P>
<P>
The 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun, who suffered a heart attack in September, 
was reported to be resting comfortably after the operation. 
</P>
<P>
"The permanent pacemaker is working fine," said Dr. Rajen Watts, her personal 
physician. "Mother Teresa had a mild bout of fever in the afternoon, but now it 
is under control. She is under constant observation, but we can say that she is 
fine now." 
</P>
<P>
Mother Teresa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her work among the 
poor, was hospitalized Sept. 5, and suffered a heart attack three days later.
