Queen Elizabeth II is the most popular member of Britain's royal family, 
closely followed by her mother, according to a survey published today. 
</P>
<P>
"We are constantly told that it is Britain's younger royals who are the most 
popular. But we find the Queen and Queen Mother are far and away the best 
loved, with over 36% of the total vote," said Michele Brown, curator of the 
Royal Britain exhibition, which polled 6,500 visitors. 
</P>
<P>
After the queen and the Queen Mother came Princess Anne, the queen's daughter. 
Prince Charles, heir to the throne, was fourth and his wife, Diana, was fifth.
