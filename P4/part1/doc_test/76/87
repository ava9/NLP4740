FT  10 DEC 93 / Private future for civil service is spelt out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
With the publication of yesterday's white paper on executive agencies, the
government has for the first time spelt out its vision of the future shape
of the civil service after a decade of piecemeal reform.
It has also given notice that the emphasis in future will be on bringing in
the private sector to provide public services wherever possible.
Agencies which have previously escaped the threat of privatisation may find
that they are up for sale following reviews which are already conducted for
all agencies at regular intervals.
At the heart of the government's vision is a distinction between the core
departments concerned with making and implementing policy and the much
larger periphery of organisations that will be responsible for delivering
public services.
A core of about 10 per cent of the civil service - perhaps 50,000 civil
servants in all - will work for the Whitehall departments servicing
ministers, distributing public funds and setting standards for public
services.
The remaining 500,000 civil servants will work in the provision of public
services.
A small minority will directly work for government departments, particularly
where their functions need to be under strong central control as in units
which support front-line units in the armed forces.
But more than 80 per cent of all civil servants will soon work in executive
agencies; separate organisations created to deliver particular services to
the public such as benefit payments or tax collection.
Each of these agencies has its own chief executive, often appointed from
outside the civil service and given considerable management freedom. Each
must meet financial and service targets negotiated with government
departments, and publish an annual report on its performance.
As a result of yesterday's announcement more of the work of agencies will be
carried out by the private sector.
Some agencies will be privatised, as has happened for DVOIT, the information
technology agency of the Department of Transport.
Others in information technology, accountancy, payroll, scientific testing
and property services could follow suit and would be attractive to the
private sector. In other cases, commercial management will be brought in to
manage agencies which the government wishes to retain in public ownership.
This has happened with the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston. It
is managed as a Goco (government-owned, contractor-operated) company by
Hunting, the aviation, defence and oil services company. Similar
arrangements may be attractive for the agencies which manage the royal
parks, the public records office and palaces such as Hampton Court and the
Tower of London.
Some agencies will be too sensitive for either approach in the foreseeable
future. This would apply to the controversial Child Support Agency, which
extracts maintenance from absent parents, the prison service and the Crown
Prosecution Service. Their managers will be expected to introduce commercial
disciplines through further market-testing, by putting parts of their work
out to tender.
Even those parts of the civil service remaining in the core will not be
immune to change. The government plans to recruit more outsiders for top
posts and to make top mandarins more accountable.
Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, in presenting the
changes yesterday said civil service reform was alive and well, with 'the
momentum of change gathering pace'.
The civil service which emerges will be very different from that inherited
by the Conservatives when they came to power in 1979.
