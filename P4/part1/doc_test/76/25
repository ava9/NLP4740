FT  13 AUG 93 / Letter: A different royal rogue

<TEXT>
Sir, In Antony Thorncroft's article, 'Behind the Queen's curtains' (August
8), he states that Queen Victoria's father was the Duke of York. I can only
assume that the splendour of his surroundings at Buckingham Palace
temporarily distracted him since her father was, in fact, the Duke of Kent.
At the time of her birth, I believe the Duke of York was a character by the
name of Frederick and was the Duke of Kent's brother. As for Thorncroft's
epithet of rogue, I guess that is a matter for personal interpretation,
although one wonders whether he was referring to the Duke of Kent or the
Duke of York.
