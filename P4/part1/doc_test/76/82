Queen Elizabeth II made Ronald Reagan a knight today, but without the kneeling 
and dubbing because the knighthood is honorary for foreigners, who cannot be 
called "Sir." 
</P>
<P>
The Buckingham Palace announcement ended days of speculation about whether the 
former President, whose easy manner and conservative ardor made him a firm 
friend of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, would receive the highest honor for 
non-Britons. Honors to foreigners are recommended by the government. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan told reporters outside the palace: "I feel greatly honored." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan emerged from lunch with the queen with a box containing the insignia of 
an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honorable Order of the Bath, one of 
the highest orders of chivalry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Queen's Warning 
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth accompanied the Reagans to their car to say goodby, and 
jokingly warned Reagan: "Don't drop them." 
</P>
<P>
With his wife, Nancy, beaming beside him, he responded: "I can't say how proud 
I am to receive it." 
</P>
<P>
"Sir" is a title reserved for Britons, but at dinner parties Reagan can sit 
closer to the queen than unknighted former presidents. He also can use the 
initials "G. C. B." after his name. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans arrived Sunday for a private visit and dined with Thatcher on 
Tuesday night. They will fly to Paris on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The queen has been pleased to approve a recommendation . . . that the 
honorable Ronald Reagan be appointed an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Most 
Honorable Order of the Bath," the palace announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth made the presentation after lunch in her private dining room, 
where she rarely entertains foreigners. The Reagans were the only guests of the 
monarch and her husband, Prince Philip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Kneeling 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Britons receiving knighthoods, Reagan did not have to kneel and be 
tapped on the shoulder by the royal sword. Instead, the queen handed him the 
order's insignia: a star, badge and broad ribbon of crimson silk. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan was the 57th American to receive an honorary knighthood, and the first 
since World War II to receive the Order of the Bath, which has its origins in 
knights appointed at the coronations of Saxon kings. 
</P>
<P>
The name comes from the symbolic bath taken by medieval candidates for 
knighthood. Admission to the order recognizes "conspicuous service" to Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Honorary GCBs include Dwight D. Eisenhower, as the Allied supreme commander in 
World War II; Gen. George C. Marshall, as author of the Marshall Plan; Gen. 
Douglas MacArthur, and Adm. Chester Nimitz. 
</P>
<P>
Caspar W. Weinberger, defense secretary in the Reagan Administration, got the 
title in February, 1988, but in the lower Order of the British Empire. 
</P>
<P>
Other American honorary knights include philanthropist John Paul Getty II, 
Henry Ford III, former Secretary of State Dean Rusk and actors Douglas 
Fairbanks Jr. and Sidney Poitier.
