RELIGION may be set for a resurrection in our schools but it is still
anathema to the television companies. The BBC has whittled down its coverage
to little more than the Thora Hird Hymnal, while ITV trusts to the Harry
Secombe Songbook to ease viewers into Eternity. But if the Sabbath is a
no-go area for God, the schedules are keen to ensure that there is a flow of
thoughtful, uplifting, sobering programmes on offer on Sunday evenings to
prepare the population for the week ahead.
Last Sunday was no exception. On Channel Four there was The Real Thing,
which pretends 'to look at religious belief in a post-Modern world'.
(Post-modern is one of those lovely buzz phrases which means little but
suggests that the user is way ahead of the game). Anyway this programme
seems well designed to satisfy Dissenters. On BBC, Everyman gave us the
harrowing story of Jason, four and dying, which concentrated the mind on the
transience of life to the satisfaction of the Orthodox, while ITV came up
with a repeat of The Monarchy which, as a hierarchical institution with
mystical powers, successfully replaced organised religion in the lives of
the people until it fell into schism.
The Real Thing was infuriating. It was obviously prepared by robots with
attitude. Narrators Geoffrey Palmer and Zoe Wanamaker endowed the script
with all the reverence of Holy Writ: every line was a computer-speak
aphorism. In apology for the words, the screen was busy with arbitrary
images.
The basic message was that science had done away with absolute truths, so a
South American Indian fertility ritual, based around the beheading of a
fretwork crocodile, was just as relevant as our rational attitude to life.
It's all horses for courses. Just to ram home the point that we westerners
can get up to some pretty suspect myth-making of our own there was film of a
Hitler rally. But hold on - if all rituals are judgment-free that means that
as long as the Sieg Heil-ing Nazis believed in their play-acting that should
be OK, too.
The programme worked in that it found me constantly saying 'Hold on', but
the supercilious condescension of the experts, including Professor Bernard
Williams of Oxford University, was ultimately too much to bear. Our Western
values may be dubious, but the rest of the world seems anxious enough to
embrace them, giving up face tattoos for Sony Walkmans. The Noble Savage is
as out-dated as Modernism.
The irrelevance of the The Real Thing was pinpointed an hour earlier in The
Living Planet. David Attenborough showed remarkable film of Inuit (Eskimos)
tracking and killing a polar bear and eating its raw flesh. They then built
a snow igloo that was cosy enough for a young child to happily frolic in
naked. It was a way of life unchanged for two millenia. Then came the
Attenborough pay-off: 'That film was shot 20 years ago'. Their traditional
way of life is now history. The Real Thing is in danger of trying to make
bricks with non-existent straw.
There was no obvious religious feeling in The Real Thing, but it throbbed
gently throughout Everyman. The attitude of the parents and the hospice
staff, as they tried to make Jason's brief life worthwhile, was exemplary.
Suddenly there was a homily, pronounced with no religious undercurrent but
strangely transcendental in its meaning.
A nurse who had cared for many terminally ill children said that there came
a time when, instead of congratulating the child for his grit in getting
through the day, parents should start to thank him for being such a treasure
and let him know that he could go now. She said the children accepted, even
welcomed, the change. Jason had the liveliest of younger sisters: he seemed
to be waiting for her to walk before he died. Tamsin Day-Lewis's film
suggested that the briefest, most tragic, life could give a meaning to
existence.
Mark Redhead's six part survey of The Monarchy could hardly be more happily
co-incidental. It is a bit worthy, with a succession of predictable talking
heads - Lord St John of Fawsley for the defence; John Griggs on the muted
attack - but the prosaic pace made its under-stated facts seem that much
more extraordinary.
The media have been excavating the monarchy for 20 years now, but have
apparently only scraped the surface of the institution - for example, the
fact that minor royals, like Princess Michael of Kent, curtsy good night to
premier league players like Princess Margaret even when there is no one
around to observe them. And the Prince of Wales is equally deferential when
greeting the Queen - after their secretaries have fixed up a meeting.
The programme forcefully pointed out that all the Queen's chief advisers
come from a closely knit group of aristocratic families, and that a
re-incarnated Queen Victoria would find few changes inside the royal
parlour. All the apparent movement of recent years has been window dressing.
You began to understand the strain put on outsiders who marry into the Firm.
* * * So farewell Out, Channel 4's Gay and Lesbian programme which has
brightened up so many Wednesday evenings. It went out with a double helping
last week - a gritty piece on the travails of German transvestites, then
some mildly erotic movies on Thursday, which would presumably have caused
consternation had the participants been heterosexual.
Out is a victim of a short-sighted economy drive. Out had a style and
panache all its own, unsurprising from a sector of society which cares
greatly for appearances and attitudes. It was self-righteous when it
confronted gay politics; achingly funny when it turned the camera on
subjects that heterosexuals would find embarrassing, such as body hair; and
arcanely topical when investigating matters of style, such as the problems
of gays who like to dress like skinheads, traditionally enthusiastic queer
bashers.
Out was out about everything, not excluding the conflict which often exists
between Gays and Lesbians. A conceived common foe has forced them into
uneasy partnership, like the ill-suited Burgess and MacLean. Gays obviously
enjoyed speaking out on this matter: how their friendly clubs become
menacing arenas when the dungareed and tattooed Feminist thought-police
among Lesbians join the party. The Gays' only means of defence apparently is
to set up an insistent whisper of 'fish, fish'. Odd.
Having been bereft of my own favourite soap since Compact, I had high hopes
of Eldorado. It began well - low ratings and dire reviews are usually the
birth pangs of a monster hit - but I am rapidly becoming disillusioned. Why
are all the men such absolute bastards - complete wimps like Bunny, or music
hall villains like Marcus? The only nice one is gay Freddie.
Why does the multi-million, specially built, villa complex in Spain look
like the back lot at Shepperton? The atmosphere is more Latvia than Latin.
Where is the sun; where are the natives? Where do they all come from and
what are they all doing there? Why do they all talk like Blind Date
panellists? The only decent thing in it is Fizz (played by Kathy Pitkin),
who not only acts all the other younger members of the cast off the screen
but who also looks like someone you might see on the playa at Torremolinos.
When she goes, I go.
