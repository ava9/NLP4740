the risks of altering the police and army presence in Ulster

In security matters, as in all Northern Irish matters, the British
government is treading a tightrope, with the demons of renewed war gnashing
all too visibly on either side.
As each community looks to see what it has lost or gained at the expense of
the other, people are watching for any changes in the numbers and tactics of
the 30,000 people who serve the British authorities as soldiers and police
officers.
Any hint of over-hasty 'demilitarisation' will be treated by Protestants as
confirmation that last week's IRA ceasefire was either the product of a
deal, or else the harbinger of a deal, from which they have been excluded.
For the Roman Catholic ghettos some scaling down of the police and army
presence could provide a first answer to the question that Sinn Fein leaders
were doggedly asked by their supporters last week: 'What have we got?'
The worriers of each community are haunted by the ghosts of slain comrades,
and the prospect that those deaths could go unvindicated.
In this climate there is such a danger of 'sending the wrong signal' that
the army and police have maintained an unusual public silence.
Sir Hugh Annesley, chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, gave
some hints about future tactics in July. Choosing his words carefully he
said his 8,500 men carried out their duties in response to the level of
threat that existed. If the threat in a particular district subsided there
could be a reduction in police patrols and an end to the army's role in
supporting those patrols.
Sir Hugh made clear that if violence ended there would be no need to renew
the Emergency Provisions Act, which gives the security forces extra freedom
to search homes, vehicles and persons.
Other tokens of demilitarisation demanded by nationalists included the
opening of remote border roads, and an end to low-flying helicopters.
The closure of roads reflected evidence that most incidents in border areas
were made possible by the movement of men and weaponry across the frontier,
and low-flying was made necessary by the danger of any other form of
transport.
Apart from the police about 19,000 people from the regular armed forces are
deployed in Northern Ireland. They include six battalions on two-year tours,
another six on gruelling 'emergency tours' lasting half a year, plus about
5,500 members of the Royal Irish Regiment, which is locally recruited but
part of the regular army. If tension eased substantially one of the first
options for the army would be the ending of emergency tours, which have
strained the country's defence capacity.
Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, issued an uncompromising statement
last week to the effect that the 'forces of the Crown' were unacceptable to
his community and should be withdrawn. But it seems unlikely that the IRA
would have agreed to a ceasefire unless it had some faith in the capacity
and willingness of UK forces to restrain the activities of loyalist gunmen.
The real test for British policy could come where locally recruited security
forces, who are overwhelmingly Protestant, found that their efforts were
almost entirely employed against gunmen from their own community.
It is an article of nationalist faith that these local forces - the police
and the RIR - are at best soft on and at worstsympathetic to loyalist
paramilitaries.
Yet RUC men have been prepared in recent years to risk the opprobrium of
their hardline co-religionists. They have incurred loyalist wrath for their
tough policing of Protestant demonstrations against the 'treachery' of
Britain.
In Belfast, in particular, the police have tended to form a community within
a community with their own sports and social clubs and even housing
developments.
That said, nobody would expect the local security forces to react with
equanimity if they felt the province was being dragooned into a united
Ireland, without consent and at an uncontrollable pace.
Northern Ireland would be entering dangerous and unchartered waters if, as a
result of change in the political situation, the authorities abruptly laid
off large numbers of local policemen and soldiers or asked them to serve an
entirely new set of political masters - including, as many servicemen would
see it, the men responsible for killing hundreds of their colleagues.
The security business - including the RIR, the territorial army, the police
and private security - has become an increasingly important source of
employment for a Protestant community whose old workplaces - the shipyards
and engineering works - have shrunk or vanished.
Service to the Crown has been a talisman of Protestant identity for
centuries. If Protestants are dazed and apprehensive now it is because they
cannot understand why Britain does not show gratitude for their forebears'
sacrifice in countless wars.
The RIR, for example, regards itself as a successor to Irish regiments that
fought in the West Indies in 1762, the Cape of Good Hope in 1806, the
Crimean War half a century later and the Boer War at the beginning of this
century.
For other English-speaking countries - Australia, Canada, even southern
Ireland - the appalling casualties of the first world war were part of a
coming of age, a growing away from England.
For tens of thousands of Ulster families who were bereaved by the Battle of
the Somme in 1916 their sacrifice left a debt which Britain can never fully
repay.
When Britain considers what to do with the 15,000 Ulstermen currently in its
service, and the hundreds of thousands who have worn British uniforms in the
past, it will have to tread very softly indeed, for it is treading on the
most cherished of dreams.
