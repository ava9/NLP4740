A HISTORY OF WARFARE
by John Keegan
Hutchinson Pounds 20, 432 pages
TO SAY that war is a continuation of politics by other means is like saying
divorce is a continuation of marriage by other means. Nonetheless the great
military theorist Carl von Clausewitz said exactly that. Indeed it was a
central tenet of his book On War (1832), which became the sacred text of
generations of German staff officer. Clausewitz's advocacy of total war,
involving vast, indoctrinated 'citizen' armies which could only be raised by
conscription, lay at the heart of the Schlieffen Plan, and of Hitler's
Wehrmacht.
Understandably, no serious commentator on war has been able to ignore
Clausewitz, and most have succumbed to his thrust. Among such commentators
the historian John Keegan stands pre-eminent. His past publications,
including The Face of Battle - a hugely absorbing reconstruction of
Agincourt, Waterloo and the Somme - have altered and enriched our perception
of warfare as something hideously logical in its detail. Now comes A History
of Warfare: not just his latest offering, but a summation of much that has
gone before, and Keegan's attempt to secure for himself at least a
separation from the Prussian genius.
War, he proposes, has quite as much to do with culture as with politics, at
least in its origins. And just as there are different kinds of culture, so
there are different kinds of warfare. Keegan identifies four historic phases
of warfare, which he calls Stone, Flesh, Iron and Fire. Each refers to a
primary combat resource - in the case of Flesh, horses. And while these
provide him with the thematic chapter headings needed to make sense of six
millennia of armed conflict, between chapters he conducts mopping up
operations ('interludes') that account for the 'limitations of warfare'
(mainly the weather and terrain), fortification, armies and logistics.
Although the whole book swarms with brilliant analysis and a command of
history unrivalled among militaritians, it is the earlier sections of
Keegan's lengthy rumination that are the most satisfying. He casts his net
very wide. Not only does he examine warfare among the Samurai, the Zulus,
and the Mamelukes of Egypt, but, guided by anthropologists, he explores the
Yanomano, the Maring and the Aztecs. He also offers an explanation for the
disappearance of the Easter Island civilisation.
What he finds among these examples is that warfare, while limited by such
materials as were available, also limited itself. Conflict and combat were
ritualised. Tribal people, aware of survival values as few of us living in
comfortable urban homes can be, sought to contain, not to exploit, the
damage to life that can be done by even the most rudimentary weapons. War
therefore was practised in harmony with the greater needs of the societies
it protected. Among the Polynesians of Easter Island such controlled conduct
maintained an extraordinary culture for several centuries. It was only when
the islanders began disregarding their own taboos, and elected instead for
war to the bone, that their society was wasted.
As this was happening, across the Pacific the Japanese, in a startling
renunciation of seemingly superior technology, opted to dispense with the
gun. Although the samurai had an obvious interest as a privileged class in
keeping to the way of the sword, a generalised apprehension of the
consequences of powder and ball informed Japan's decision.
In these contexts, Clausewitzian true, or all-out, war becomes merely a type
of warfare specific to some cultures only, if not in fact an aberration.
Keegan's problem however is twofold. As he journeys through time toward the
20th century, it is the Prussian mode that comes to dominate all others, not
just in the west, but globally. Secondly, as he journeys forward, the more
difficulty he has in deciding which wars to discuss, and which to leave
alone. There are just too many of them.
But Keegan's actual selection does not help his suite. Guerrilla, or
people's, war generally gets short shrift. Vietnam is dismissed in less than
a page, and there is nothing on Nicaragua, El Salvador or Guatemala. Equally
odd is his failure to isolate and debate intelligence-gathering as a primary
component of warfare - unlike, for instance, Sun Tzu writng in the fourth
century BC
Today, although guerrilla warfare is likely to persist as a means of waging
armed struggle against unequal odds, and although weapons of
mass-destruction must inevitably keep alive the possibility of total war in
the future, the trend is toward surgical warfare: a synthesis in fact of
air-power, long-range missiles, commando tactics and, of course,
intelligence.
So the wheel comes full circle in Keegan's favour. It does appear that,
wittingly or otherwise, we are rediscovering the fundamental responsibility
of warfare, which is to preserve as much as to destroy.
