It is easily forgotten that the Imperial War Museum holds the largest
collection of modern British art outside the Tate. The loss of the old
exhibition galleries when the museum was remodelled some years ago meant the
effective disappearance of that collection as such, for while temporary
exhibitions continued to be mounted, its regular rotation on semi-permanent
display ceased. The presentation of two fresh thematic displays, set up in
the old way in the new upper galleries, is therefore especially welcome.
Artists have always responded creatively to the stimulus of war, but
commissioning them officially to do so only became established in the later
years of the first world war. Such was the variety and strength of the work
that the practice was resumed at the outset of the second. A display is here
accorded to each of them.
With only The Slade School 1914-1918 to go on, it was too easy to jump to
the wrong conclusion. In the event, the very artists whom one would expect
to celebrate under such a head, the radical and modernist young - Lewis,
Bomberg, Nevinson, Nash and the rest of them, and all from the Slade - are
missing, consigned to another show that opens shortly at the Altes Museum in
Berlin and comes to the Barbican in the autumn. In their place are those of
their contemporaries who represent the older and more conventional tradition
of the Slade, with its emphasis on fine drawing and accurate observation.
Slade professor Henry Tonks is represented by impressive studies of a
casualty clearing station on the Western Front and of village scenes from
the Russian campaign of 1919. As with others in the show, notably Colin
Gill, the larger composition drawn upon such material is more worthy than
exciting. The drawings, or at least the smaller studies, whether on paper or
canvas, are the thing, taken directly from the subject, caught on the wing -
land girls in smocks and breeches by Randolph Schwabe; soldier portraits by
Augustus John and Ambrose McEvoy; Stanley Spencer's tiny wash studies of
travois and stretcher-bearers in Macedonia; William Orpen's oil sketches of
deserted trenches, of an inn behind the lines, of himself in tin hat 'Ready
to Start'.
The star of the show is Eric Kennington with his extraordinary large
painting on glass, of 'The Kensingtons at Laventie', a group of soldiers in
the snow, wounded or simply exhausted, just out of the line. The frustration
is to see so little of the sculptor, Charles Jagger, he of the Artillery
Memorial at Hyde Park Corner, the Soldier reading a letter at Paddington
Station and many other remarkable memorials, and here shown by a single
soldier maquette.
Europe Regained 1943-1945 takes the later campaigns of the second war, in
Italy, France and Germany, seen mainly through the eyes of three artists,
Anthony Gross, Edward Ardizzone and Edward Bawden - though there are other
significant contributions, notably Henry Carr's close-toned Monte Cassino;
Richard Eurich's mulberry harbour in preparation; and Barnet Freedman's
large panoramic view of the foreshore at Arromanches, crowded with equipment
and supplies, on D Day + 20.
Gross follows the allied advance through Holland and into Germany, images of
refugees, devastated villages and the wrecked Rhine bridges. Ardizzone, in
Italy and Germany, as always takes a more intimate view of the military
life, with troops sight-seeing in the Sistine Chapel, sleeping on the floor,
or looking intently out from an observation post in the Castel S. Angelo.
Eric Taylor's Belsen studies are obviously distressing and moving, yet the
two most poignant images in the entire double show are Ardizzone's, of
German village women waving white flags and, even more so, of one of them
desperate to save her pig.
Bawden's war was in Italy, shown here by a group of characteristically large
water-colours, of Italian partisans in their headquarters, of wreckage near
the Ponte Vecchio and a quite remarkable view from the rooftops down into
the square at Ravenna, where a parade to honour a partisan hero is taking
place. If Bawden had only painted as much on canvas as he did on paper, he
would be seen as one of the major artists of his time.
