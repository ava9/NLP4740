When Crispin Davis last week resigned from United Distillers, Guinness'
spirits division, after only 15 months as managing director, his departure
was widely cited as proof of what most consumers already knew: that Scotch
whisky and soap suds do not go together.
Guinness says Davis left because of a personality clash. Competitors say the
hard-nosed marketing methods Davis learned in his previous career at Procter
&amp; Gamble, the world's biggest detergents manufacturer, did not fit a
business which lives by premium pricing and exclusive brand image.
Whatever finally triggered his resignation, it raises a broader question.
How easily can marketing skills be transferred between different businesses
at a time when they are more widely in demand than ever before?
As competition intensifies, companies in sectors as diverse as banking,
telecommunications, pharmaceuticals and public transport are finding -
sometimes for the first time - that learning to woo and win consumers is
essential for survival.
Peter Breen, managing partner of Heidrick &amp; Struggles, an international
executive search company, says marketing experience is now a pre-requisite
for most top-level management posts. 'Whatever the job title, marketing is a
common denominator,' he says.
Those who have taken their marketing expertise into new fields stress that
it is not a universal discipline which can be effortlessly transplanted.
Above all, it only delivers results when combined with a clear understanding
of what makes individual companies tick.
'There are certain fundamentals which can be transferred,' says John Robb,
chief executive of the pharmaceuticals group Wellcome, who cut his teeth in
consumer products marketing. 'But even if you are moving within the same
industry, you still have to learn about the company you're moving to. You
have to adjust to the new style.'
For outsiders that can be a stiff challenge. Mike Sommers, recently named
managing director of MGM Cinemas after three years as marketing director of
the TSB banking group, vividly recalls the shock of moving to retailing from
the consumer goods industry a decade ago.
'For the first month I would sit in meetings and not understand a word
anyone said. I felt like a kid who wants to play on a roundabout, and nobody
will slow down to let him on,' he says.
He and others argue that the transition can be particularly tough for
executives schooled in big consumer products manufacturers such as P&amp;G and
Mars. That may appear paradoxical, because such companies have been widely
regarded as marketing 'universities'.
However, sceptics say that their success has depended heavily on rigorous
adherence to doing the same things steadily better - an approach that can
breed inflexibility and make it hard for alumni to adapt to new corporate
cultures.
'There is a big dilemma when you take somebody who has worked in a company
with strong life-support systems and very clear rules for everything,' says
Sir James Blyth, chief executive of Boots, whose previous employers include
Mars, General Foods and Plessey.
When marketing executives from big consumer manufacturers switch
successfully to other companies, he says it is often because they got out
early or were naturally talented, rather than because of any particular
skills they brought with them.
Colin Fisher, managing director of SRU, a management consultancy with
clients including Unilever and Marks and Spencer, goes further. He says many
big consumer groups prosper mainly because they attract the brightest
graduates, not because their marketing methods are intrinsically superior.
'A lot of consumer products people emphasise the means rather than the
ends,' says Sommers. 'They forget it's all about consumers and become
obsessed with advertising and packaging. Moving to businesses which are
based on distribution or sell mainly to men can be a big wrench for them.'
But successful marketing is more than a set of techniques. It is a state of
mind which informs corporate priorities. Specialists say that the toughest
task of all is to instil it in businesses which have previously paid little
attention to customer service and consumer satisfaction.
Eurotunnel, for instance, has only just switched its attention from boring
holes in the ground to seeking passengers. It has recently recruited
executives from consumer companies including Lever Brothers and Heinz.
One of their first achievements has been to talk the board out of plans to
run an advertising campaign celebrating Eurotunnel's engineering
achievements, and to emphasise instead the services it offers.
Mercury Communications, part of Cable and Wireless, has also hired marketing
talent from the consumer products industry. Roy Doughty, director of
marketing, sales and customer service for One-2-One, Mercury's new mobile
telephone service, previously worked for Duracell, the battery maker.
'I believe we're launching a brand in the way a consumer products company
would do,' he says, although he admits that the technical complexity of
telecommunications systems means that much longer lead times are required.
Although Mercury Communications has been widely applauded for imaginative
advertising, some specialists say that marketing has yet to lay down deep
roots in its engineering-dominated culture. 'Mercury only looks good because
it is competing with BT, which doesn't even have a marketing director on its
board,' says one.
Kevin Gavaghan, former retailing executive responsible for launching
electronic banking services such as First Direct, Orchard and Vector at
Midland Bank, says that the first priority for people recruited to a company
to improve marketing is to ensure that they have support from the top.
'You have to be invited in by a sponsor who knows exactly what he is
buying,' he says. Gavaghan says he received such backing when he joined
Midland, but left because the bank's commitment to marketing dwindled after
a change of senior management.
But for Sir James Blyth, the golden rule for peripatetic marketing
executives is to be absolutely sure what they are letting themselves in for:
'If you have moved companies a couple of times, you learn to pick out those
areas where your experience is valuable. But you'd better listen very
carefully to people in your new company about exactly why it is different.'
