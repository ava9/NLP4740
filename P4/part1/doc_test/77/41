  [Text] Jakarta, Feb 3 (ANTARA) -- Representatives of APEC 
(Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) member countries at a 
meeting here Thursday agreed to elect the United States as 
chairman of the forum's Budget and Administration Committee. The 
meeting, officially called APEC Senior Officials Meeting 
(APEC-SOM), is the first of a series of four scheduled to 
prepare an APEC ministerial conference in November. With the 
agreement reached at Thursday's meeting, the United States would 
be the first country to lead the forum's Budget and 
Administration Committee. 
  Saodah Syahruddin, an Indonesian delegate to the APEC-SOM, 
said the United States was one of three nominees for the 
position. The meeting eventually chose the United States in 
view of its position as former chairman of APEC's first summit 
meeting which took place in Seattle in November last year. 
  Mrs. Syahruddin, who is director of developing countries 
economic cooperation at Indonesia's Foreign Ministry, explained 
that the meeting also agreed to make it a convention that the 
chairman of the last APEC summit meeting automatically becomes 
chairman of APEC's Budget and Administration Committee for the 
subsequent term. 
  This meant that after Indonesia acts as chairman of the 
second APEC summit meeting scheduled for later this year, it 
would thereafter also serve as the forum's Budget and 
Administration Committee leader, she said. Mrs. Syahruddin said 
delegates at Thursday's meeting earlier considered two other 
ways of determining who would lead the Budget and Administration 
Committee. 
  One proposal would have the chairman of a coming APEC summit 
become the committee leader. The other would require the 
chairman of the committee to be appointed based on an election 
held annually. "But finally, all participants agreed that the 
chairman of the last APEC summit meeting should serve as 
chairman of the committee. This will be a permanent procedure," 
she said. 
  Mrs. Syahruddin also said APEC will not admit new members 
during the next three years. The question of admitting new 
members would be studied first, she added. Currently APEC has 17 
members, namely the six countries grouped in ASEAN -- Brunei 
Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, 
Thailand, plus Australia, Canada, New Zealand, China, Taiwan, 
Korea, Hongkong, Papua New Guinea, Japan, the United States, and 
Mexico. At the Seattle summit, it was agreed that Chile would be 
admitted as a member at the summit due to be convened in 
Indonesia next November. 
  The APEC-SOM meeting opened last Wednesday and will end on 
Friday. It is being attended by officials of its member 
countries and three observers.
