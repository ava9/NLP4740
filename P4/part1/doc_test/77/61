  [Text] Western sources in Seoul knowledgeable in North 
Korean-Chinese relations reported on 27 April that China 
provided North Korea with food, including 10,000 tonnes of rice, 
as "birthday gifts" on 15 April, President Kim Il-song's 
birthday. 
  Reporting that China also "presented" 10 tonnes of meat and 
five tonnes of edible oil to North Korea, the sources noted: 
"The delivery of those 'food gifts' by China was very unusual, 
and it hints of North Korea's food problems." It was learned 
that China gave North Korea 400 tons of pork as a gift on 
President Kim's birthday in 1992. 
  Regarding this, the ROK Government officials knowledgeable 
in 
North Korean affairs said: "In 1993, North Korea yielded only 
3.8 million tonnes of rice due to the cold weather, and the 
amount is down 500,000 tonnes from other years and falls 
absolutely short of its necessary rice amount of 6.3 million 
tonnes." They added: "China provides North Korea with 1 million 
tonnes of rice every year in the form of barter trade. It is 
unprecedented, however, for China to present food to North Korea 
free of charge." 
  Government officials analyzed that, although the 10,000-ton 
rice provided by China is insufficient to solve North Korea's 
food problems, it was probably of help in somewhat increasing 
the North Korean people's rice rations or in increasing the 
ratio of rice in mixing rice and other grains. 
  This amount of rice can be loaded on 2,000 five-ton trucks 
and is over 50,000 soms -- North Korea sent 50,000 soms of rice 
to the ROK when we suffered flood damage in the middle of 1983.
