FT  10 MAR 93 / People: Sommer moves from US to Sony Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sony is strengthening its marketing focus in Europe with the appointment of
Ron Sommer to the post of president and chief operating officer. He will
take up his appointment in April.
He joins Jack Schmuckli, chairman and chief executive of Sony's European
operations, in establishing a US-style top management team to oversee the
company's sales, marketing and manufacturing operations. The heads of the
sales and marketing companies will report directly to Sommer.
Now 43, Sommer has been president and chief operating officer of Sony
Corporation of America since 1990. A math-ematician born in Israel and
educated at Vienna University, he joined Sony in 1980 and six years later
was appointed president of Sony Germany.
His early experience was in the computer industry with the former
high-flying Nixdorf Computer, now merged into Siemens Nixdorf Information
Systems. At one stage he was head of the company's largest subsidiary,
Nixdorf France.
Colleagues describe him as analytical and energetic with the ability to
motivate his staff.
He will need all those talents to sustain Sony's impetus through Europe's
long-lasting recession.
