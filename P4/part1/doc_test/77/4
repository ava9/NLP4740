Kut-al-Amara, Cold Harbor, the Somme. All sites of major battles that ought to 
strike at least a note of caution into the minds of those unnamed "high-ranking 
policy-makers, senior military officials, U.S. government analysts and others" 
who are calling for an immediate military offensive against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
But those past battles obviously have no meaning to them, for war to those 
pundits is a bloodless abstraction, not an actual clash of arms where rash and 
ill-considered actions can have catastrophic results. 
</P>
<P>
For those men and women who would actually have to make such an assault, 
however, and for their commanders, those battles have real meaning. They warn 
of the consequences of not thinking about the unthinkable -- the fact that 
defeat is always a battlefield possibility. In war, hubris -- underestimating 
your enemy and failing to take his strength and dispositions into account -- 
can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
Cold Harbor, thanks to the recent magnificent PBS series on the Civil War, is 
probably the best known of these battles. As historian Shelby Foote tells it, 
in the Union Army's frontal assault on Confederate breastworks at Cold Harbor 
in Virginia on June 3, 1864, "Grant lost better than 7,000 (killed and 
wounded), most of them in the course of the first eight minutes." 
</P>
<P>
And at the first battle of the Somme in World War I, the slaughter was even 
worse. British Gen. Henry Rawlinson, the Gen. Michael J. Dugan of his time, 
believed that war could be won with firepower alone. 
</P>
<P>
In Dugan's case it was air bombardment. It can so shatter enemy resistence in 
Kuwait, he said last month, that soldiers "can walk in and not have to fight." 
</P>
<P>
In Rawlinson's case, it was artillery. Some 1,437 British guns fired 1,508,652 
shells into the German lines in the five-day bombardment preceding the attack. 
"You can go over the top with a walking stick," the infantrymen were told. "You 
will not need rifles." 
</P>
<P>
But when the attack jumped off on the morning of July 1, 1916, the German 
defenses had not been neutralized. The British Army took 57,470 casualties on 
the first day alone, including 19,240 killed in action, most of them in the 
first 30 minutes of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
One thing Iraq is good at is defense of prepared positions, for 95% of its 
battles during the eight-year war with Iran were fought on the tactical 
defensive. The Iranians lost soldiers by the hundreds of thousands in fruitless 
assaults and finally had to sue for peace. 
</P>
<P>
One of war's unintended consequences is defeat, as the British army also found 
in an earlier attempt to capture Baghdad. The battle of Kut-al-Amara in April, 
1916, is not well-known, but it provides compelling lessons. 
</P>
<P>
Initially sent to the area in 1914 to protect access to Persian Gulf oil, the 
British force prematurely went over to the offensive in October, 1915. Under 
the command of Maj. Gen. Sir Charles Townshend, the troops set off to capture 
Baghdad, then part of the Turkish Ottoman Empire. Forced back by a determined 
Turkish defense, the expedition was besieged at Kut-al-Amara on the Tigris 
River, about 180 air miles short of its objective. On April 29, 1916, Townshend 
capitulated. 
</P>
<P>
"To reach Kut cost Townshend 7,000 casualties," wrote military critic Norman 
Dixon. "During the ensuing siege a further 1,600 died; attempts to relieve his 
force accounted for another 23,000 casualties; when he eventually surrendered 
to the Turks, 13,000 of his troops went into captivity and of these 7,000 died 
while still prisoners of war. All this went for nothing, not one inch of ground 
or any political advantage." 
</P>
<P>
It was a mistake the United States is not liable to repeat.Civilian and 
military leaders who have the ultimate authority to commit American forces to 
combat have been thinking about the unthinkable. That's one way to ensure that 
the unthinkable never comes about.
