It is 80 years since the momentous first Christmas of the Great War. When
Tommy and Jerry stopped sniping at each other, met in the middle of No Man's
Land and played football. A simple act but one that was never repeated and
caused consternation among the High Commands.
Over that festive period, amid the carnage, mud, barbed wire and rotting
corpses, sanity prevailed for a flickering moment.
Christmas 1914 was always meant to be historic. The German troops had been
told at the outbreak of war in August that they would be home 'before the
leaves fell'. The British that they would be home by Christmas.
Disillusionment and homesickness were setting in in those inhospitable
freezing trenches. The ghastly reality of unrelenting savage war was
begining to dawn.
Accounts differ. But what is not in doubt is that on those barren flat
fields close to Ypres, in the north of France, the soldiers of the two sides
met and shook hands.
In The Times there are letters from officers in the field saying that
'everything on Christmas Eve was dead, even our own pet sniper who normally
sends over a good-night kiss at 9.15. Someone came running along the line
and announced a truce had broken out.'
Just how did such a thing happen? A graphic account in the Illustrated
London News suggests that a German soldier walked through the lines bearing
a Christmas tree. 'He invited the troops to go over and have a smoke and a
palaver; with one accord a truce for the night was signed. The compliments
of the season were passed with much enthusiasm between friend and foe.'
That story owes, perhaps, a certain amount to journalistic colouring. The
accepted and authentic story goes thus: the lines at Ypres were only 25
yards apart. From the German lines came the strains of Stille Hacht, Heilige
Nacht. The Germans shouted at the end: 'Come on Tommy, it's your turn now.'
The British replied first with The First Nowell and then a rousing account
of O Come All Ye Faithful. The Germans followed with Adeste Fidelis.
The soldiers from both sides huddled in their trenches desperately trying to
keep warm. The North Sea is only a few miles away and the winds blow around
Ypres and the surrounding countryside with an icy rawness. Arctic squalls
make a visit to a place such as Hill 60, close to the scene of the 1914
meeting, a chilling experience.
Through this bleak mid-winter a German called out: 'Come on Tommy, stand
up.' No Briton dared move. Snipers were about. The war was still very much
on. No Christmas truce had been intimated.
Then the British soldiers spotted a German silhouetted against the wintry
sky approaching singing a solo of Stille Nacht. Slowly, and with
understandable caution, both sides slowly crept over their trenches. With
mounting emotion this motley collection of foes met amid the shell holes and
craters.
Both sides were suspicious from the outset. Was it a trick dreamt up by
Jerry? Suddenly there was chatter and laughter. People embraced, cigars were
exchanged and jokes made. Tommies larked around in Jerry's Pickelhaube, the
German spiked helmet, and photos were taken of stern officers and men not
quite knowing how to look. But in the gruff, heavily-moustached faces there
is evidence of a smile. The eyes look relieved and at peace.
A young German who had been to university in America did the translation. A
German lieutenant asked a rather stuffy British major if he would send a
photograph of himself to his sister in Liverpool.
The weird truce spread along the line for about two miles. A surreal
atmosphere hung over those windswept acres.
And yes, a football match was played. At first with a tin can, then a proper
ball was found. Jackets and scarves were used for goal posts and 'the Saxons
beat the Anglo-Saxons 3-2'.
The dead of both sides were buried with padres from each nation assisting at
the service.
There was even a local rule agreed: 'If by any mischance a single shot had
been fired it was not to be taken as an act of war and an apology would be
accepted. Firing would not be opened without due warning on both sides.'
The report in The Times ended rather colourfully with a grand overall
picture of the incredible sight: 'There were so many lights that it looked
like Henley Royal Regatta on a Saturday night.'
In certain places the truce lasted until new year. The Highland Light
Infantry were settling down to celebrate the serious matter of the new year
when a German popped his head round their dugout and wished them all a happy
day: 'We told him amidst much laughter that we were at war with him and he
must play the game and pretend to fight.'
But the High Commands were furious. Central to the British war offensive was
the belief that the Hun was an evil beast. If the ordinary British soldier
started thinking otherwise he would automatically lose his will to fight and
kill. A letter from a sub-lieutenant to his mother in Birmingham bears this
out.
'It was amazing to realise,' he wrote, 'that the Germans were rather cheery
characters, it seems silly to be fighting them.'
Any further fraternisation with the enemy was banned. Indeed two British
officers tried to repeat the experience the following year and were
court-martialled.
Today the truce of Christmas 1914 is one of the few attractive memories of
the war. An oasis of sanity among four years of slaughter and misery.
Strangely, the papers of the day were remarkably cool about reporting the
event. In The Times, among the (horrifying) list of deaths and the
advertisements for Harrods Sale (corsets on special offer at 13s9d) and a
full-page Horlicks advertisement (at 1s6d invaluable for a genuine soldier)
there are about half a dozen reports on the dash for peace at Ypres.
But Christmas 1914 proved the compassion of the ordinary man. With
unremitting turbulence and death scattered all about him the human spirit
proved indomitable.
If only the High Commands had listened to Tommy and Jerry the history of the
the 20th century might have been very different.
