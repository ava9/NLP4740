East European States? -- Con: The Access to the Western Markets 
and to the European Union Is More Important Than Military 
Integration"] 
  [Text] Apart from a lost battle, there is almost only one 
thing that causes as much suffering: a won battle. It was the 
Duke of Wellington, the victor at Waterloo, who said this after 
the coalition's triumph over Napoleon. 
  For four years the North Atlantic alliance has been in such 
a 
misery of triumph. In 1990, after 40 years of Cold War, it won 
a victory when Soviet Communism and the imperialist system based 
on it collapsed. Since then NATO has had an embarrassing 
problem. Suddenly, it lost the enemy, the frontline, and the 
military assignment. It has almost reached the goal that its 
first secretary general, Lord Ismay, set for it: making itself 
superfluous. Since then it has been looking for a new 
self-understanding, a new reason for existence. 
  First NATO wanted to organize the transition of the East 
European national economies from plan to market -- a stupid 
idea, because it lacked everything for that: technical 
knowledge, the apparatus, and money. Then it tried to act as 
some sort of constantly ready subcontractor of the United 
Nations or the CSCE, which carries out peacekeeping or 
peacemaking missions upon order and provides the infrastructure 
for them -- however, after the depressing experience in the 
former Yugoslavia, the NATO governments are restrained. Since 
spring 1993 the Western alliance has wanted to "project security 
to East Europe" -- however, how this is supposed to be done is 
heatedly disputed in the circle of the 16 members. 
  Full membership of at least the so-called Visegrad states, 
which are impetuously urging for it: Poland, the Czech 
Republic, the Slovak Republic, Hungary? Possibly also accession 
by Slovenia, Albania, Romania, and the Baltic Republics, which 
would also like to find support in NATO? In addition, the 
inclusion of Belarus, Ukraine -- even Russia, as is suggested by 
former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker? Or a vague 
associated membership? Or not even that but just an even 
vaguer, noncommittal "Partnership for Peace"? 
  This spring FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe strongly 
supported speedy accession by the four Visegrad states. He 
wanted to see himself in the role of the "door opener." His 
justification: "If we do not export stability, we will import 
instability." The allies, however, have meanwhile strongly 
braked the defense minister's zeal. 
  They have done well. There are five reasons that indeed 
speak for prudence and caution. 
  First: The success of NATO had little to do with the text of 
the treaty. The decisive Article 5, according to which any 
attack on one alliance partner is to be considered as an attack 
on all partners, does not entail any specific commitments. The 
alliance members can decide freely which measures they consider 
"necessary." The range of possibilities reaches from a letter of 
condolences to a nuclear strike. Only the military organization 
of NATO guaranteed an immediate, automatic reaction: the common 
supreme command, a logistical system that was able to bring 
supplies from the Atlantic to the battlefield; common strategic 
planning; common planning and financing of the infrastructure 
(sea ports, airports, telecommunications links, reconnaissance 
systems); above all, however, the deployment of troops from many 
member states at the eastern border of the alliance -- which 
meant at some time 7,000 mostly American nuclear weapons on West 
German soil. France has kept away from this military 
organization since 1966, Spain has never joined it -- but both 
could afford this since their protective front -- the FRG -- was 
defended. Does the West really want to shift the old military 
border by 600 km to the east? 
  Second: Which NATO do the East Europeans actually want to 
join -- the paper NATO, like France or Spain? Or the military 
organization of NATO -- with all common points of command, 
planning, and, above all, multinational troops on Polish, Czech, 
Slovak, and Hungarian territory -- including U.S. nuclear 
weapons? If they really feel threatened, they would have to 
desire all that. At the International Bertelsmann Forum at 
Petersberg recently, the Polish prime minister, the Czech prime 
minister, the Hungarian foreign minister, and the Slovak deputy 
foreign minister evaded the answer to this question. Are they 
satisfied with a noncommittal status, like France and Spain, to 
dispel their fears? Then perhaps one need not take these fears 
all too seriously. 
  Third: NATO made a mistake -- which can be explained only 
geopolitically -- when it took in the hostile neighbors Greece 
and Turkey in 1952. More than once the two have been close to 
war; they have often sabotaged the higher purpose of the 
alliance when they tackled each other. Should the alliance now 
acquire a new belt of members, which are either hostile to each 
other (Hungary/Romania) or quarrel about their territory 
(Poland/Lithuania, Poland/Ukraine) or are threatened by internal 
ethnic conflicts (almost all states between the Baltic Sea and 
the Carpatian Mountains)? No: Before a discussion about 
accession is meaningful at all, minority rights should be 
guaranteed everywhere and borders should be declared inviolable. 
  Fourth: The West should beware of creating problems for 
the Russian reformers (and possibly destroying them), by 
shifting the NATO border close to the Russian border without any 
visible necessity. Russia must not be isolated, as long as it 
does not isolate itself through reemerging aggressiveness. It 
must not be isolated as long as it relies on cooperation with 
the West. The West must not pretend that Russia's relapse into 
profound hostility is unavoidable. However, we may say out 
loud: If Zhirinovskiy came to power or if Yeltsin and Kozyrev 
used the need of the 25 million Russians in the "near abroad" 
for protection as an excuse for an aggressive policy toward the 
Baltic states and the former Warsaw Pact states -- then NATO 
would not hesitate to expand toward the east. For this reason, 
the alliance must also preserve what military experts call the 
"regrowth capability": the capability to once again, if need 
be, tailor the shrinking armed forces of the Western alliance to 
a rising threat. Only then, if this threat has been abolished, 
will NATO really be superfluous. 
  Fifth: Currently, the Western alliance is in a deep identity 
crisis. Its foundations -- those of the old relations between 
the United States and Europe -- are swaying, a new relationship 
between the partners on both sides of the Atlantic must still be 
developed. Its overall strategy requires an overall revision. 
Fewer men, less material -- this characterizes the current 
situation. Forty percent of the soldiers and 50 percent of the 
arms arsenal of 1990 will have been abolished next year. So far 
there is no consensus on the future role of the alliance. Who 
would want to add to the structure before the foundations have 
been newly cast? 
  Certainly, NATO is more than a military alliance. However, 
the military alliance is its core: the protective community 
based on mutuality. NATO is not a cultural association and, 
therefore, it should not be used metaphorically to declare 
cultural ties. It must be able to fulfill the guarantees that 
it gives -- and those that benefit from them must, in return, be 
ready and willing to support the others in the protective and 
offensive alliance. Anything else would be not serious, 
unworthy, not credible. 
  Partnership for peace? The concept has a lot that speaks for 
it. Cooperation between NATO and East Europe common staff 
planning, multinational preparation for peacekeeping and 
peacemaking; help in democratizing the Eastern armies; 
incentives to disclose the defense budgets; in addition, the 
future prospect of full membership in NATO, as soon as 
conditions are right -- if such considerations do not pass into 
the realm of limbo anyway. The concept of the partnership for 
peace gives everyone time to think, time to adapt, time to gain 
experience. 
  However, nowadays security no longer means just military 
security. In particular in East Europe security depends less on 
military precautions but rather on functioning market economies 
and intact democratic institutions. Membership in NATO is less 
important than access to the Western markets and organizations, 
such as the European Union. If this access is denied, the 
expansion of the Western alliance to the east could do little to 
let those things grow together in Europe that belong together. 
  Let us take heed of the Duke of Wellington's insight about 
the suffering caused by won battles. But let us not be 
frightened by the manic fear that he revealed in a letter to THE 
TIMES 32 years after Waterloo: It is necessary to strengthen 
defense measures against a French invasion of England. Politics 
must never be guided by chimeras, the nightmares of aging 
generals or excited politicians.
