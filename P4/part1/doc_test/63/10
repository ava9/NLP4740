billionaire is determined to influence events ahead of presidential
elections

ROSS PEROT may no longer be running for president but the Texas billionaire
still seems to think he can influence the course of US politics this year.
Over the weekend several dozen of the state co-ordinators of his
non-candidacy gathered in Dallas to discuss the next steps with Mr Perot.
Some attempts were apparently made to persuade him to reconsider and, having
failed, yesterday's deliberations focused on some unscripted ideas Mr Perot
had tossed off in two bizarre television interviews on Friday night.
These came only a day after the formal ending of his undeclared candidacy.
In them he called on his 'volunteers' to form 'an army of patriots' to put
pressure on Democratic and Republican candidates running for president and
Congress.
'This is a much bigger, bolder step,' he said. 'What we're laying out
tonight is a plan to have the House, Senate and the White House march in
step, fix the economy and put America back to work.'
Sounding more like a candidate himself, he said he would not withdraw his
name from the 24 state presidential ballots on which he is already
registered, nor discourage the ending of incomplete petition drives.
Simultaneously he insisted repeatedly that he was no longer running.
He again promised to publish soon an economic policy plan, the absence of
which was considered one of several fatal flaws when he still had his eyes
set on the White House.
This plan, according to his few surviving political aides, would include
Dollars 500bn (Pounds 261.7bn) in budget savings over five years, achievable
through a 10 per cent reduction in the federal bureaucracy, the elimination
of many subsidies, higher income and social security taxes on the wealthy,
and increases in petrol taxes.
The weekend meeting in Dallas was called before he spoke on television on
Friday night. Some attending said Mr Perot had promised financial assistance
to the continuing effort, but others reported that his commitment was vague.
Most of his remarks were broadcast on the Larry King Live programme on Cable
News Network, the vehicle he had used to launch his efforts earlier in the
year.
Mr Perot seemed positively liberated to be talking to his friendly host,
free from the presence of hostile journalists and the professional political
advisers he had imported and then mostly ignored.
Two of them - Mr Ed Rollins and Mr Hamilton Jordan - have begun to paint a
picture of an extraordinarily disorganised and amateur effort, in which all
decisions were taken or ducked by Mr Perot alone.
Mr Perot, they said, only seemed comfortable on talk shows and in rallies
surrounded by his faithful. They warned him that this was an illusion and
that other fringe candidates - for instance, the Rev Pat Robertson four
years ago - also drew large crowds at the outset. But Mr Perot resisted all
attempts to have his image and arguments professionally burnished.
Mr King, the most prominent of the talk show hosts, seemed almost distressed
that Mr Perot had withdrawn and on several occasions virtually begged him to
reconsider. It may or may not be relevant that Mr Perot's frequent
appearances have done wonders for the show's ratings.
Several callers, however, expressed their disappointment and sense of
betrayal that he had backed out, though others were wide-eyed with
enthusiasm at the prospect of a new and different effort. One of them was
the entertainer Cher, who said she would stay involved 'as long as I know
you won't quit'.
The campaigns of President George Bush and Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic
nominee who has surged ahead in the polls, were still wooing Perot
supporters furiously over the weekend.
Even Mr Dan Quayle, the vice-president who a month ago was calling Mr Perot
'a temperamental tycoon with contempt for the constitution', had only kind
words to say.
Both are operating on the assumption that, no matter what he says to his
faithful flock, Mr Perot cannot come back. There is no recent record of this
happening in the space of an election year. Senator Gary Hart tried to do so
four years ago after dropping out, and Mr Paul Tsongas allowed his name to
remain on Democratic primary ballots this year after he suspended his
campaign, but to no avail.
However, in focusing on economic issues, especially the budget deficit and
the national debt, Mr Perot has at least lent his name, though typically not
the responsibility for his actions, to a cause which has other powerful
advocates.
Senators Warren Rudman and John Danforth, both Republicans, and Mr Tsongas
on the Democratic side are continuing to exert pressure on Mr Bush and Mr
Clinton to be more specific about their deficit reduction ideas. Both
candidates may face a decisive televised debate devoted to this issue, at
least if Mr Danforth has his way.
But Mr Perot's commitment to this cause must remain suspect for the simple
reason that he refused to let it be published while he was still an
official, if undeclared, candidate. He had promised early in May that it
would be ready in 60 days, but when he quit in the third week of July its
contents were still unknown.
It seems as though he had worked out it would be so unpopular as to damage
fatally his chances, which were already dwindling. Mr Jordan admitted it
would have created 'a firestorm' when made public, probably consuming in the
process Mr Perot.
He pre-empted that probability by withdrawing, which lessens the realistic
chances of his 'army of patriots' being more than a marginal force in the
remaining three and a half months of the campaign.
