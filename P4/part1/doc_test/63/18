FT  19 OCT 92 / Republicans feel wind of change in Michigan: Clinton poised
 to win pivotal state

DON'T let the polls get you down,' is Governor John Engler's message to his
fellow Republicans in President George Bush's Michigan campaign team. Mr
Engler and his campaign workers know what it is like to pull off an election
upset: he trailed his Democratic opponent, incumbent Governor James
Blanchard, by 14 points just two days before balloting for Michigan's
governorship in 1990.
'We easily could see something of that magnitude again,' he said yesterday.
But as Michigan chairman of the Bush re-election campaign, Mr Engler may
face an even more daunting task of resurrection.
While Michigan has often voted Democratic in state and congressional
elections, it has not favoured a Democratic presidential candidate since
Hubert Humphrey in 1968.
This year that might change: polls in the state show Governor Bill Clinton,
the Democratic nominee, leading Mr Bush by anywhere from 13 to 19 percentage
points, with about 10 per cent backing the independent, Mr Ross Perot.
Ms Colleen Pero, an Engler aide seconded to run the Bush campaign in
Michigan, warns that polls conducted by organisations from outside the state
systematically over-sample areas with low voter turnout.
All the same, Republicans admit their internal polling shows the president 9
or 10 points behind Mr Clinton.
They also acknowledge it is hard to envisage a scenario in which Mr Bush
wins re-election without winning this pivotal mid-western state's 18
electoral college votes.
There is nothing very special about the issues that are swaying Michigan
voters in this election. 'It's jobs, jobs and more jobs; the economy, jobs
and taxes over and over again,' says Ms Pero.
'I don't think Michigan is significantly different from the nation as a
whole. In fact I think it is a very good reflector,' says Professor David
Rohde, a political scientist at Michigan State University in East Lansing.
While Michigan has not suffered the same sharp economic downturn during the
Bush presidency as, say, California, it has been familiar for years with
lay-offs and plant closures - the latest being General Motors' Willow Run
assembly line. Unemployment, at 9.4 per cent in July, remains significantly
higher than the national average.
Some of the issues that Mr Bush has emphasised cut both ways in Michigan.
The recently concluded North American Free Trade Agreement, for example,
worries car industry and other unionised workers in the Detroit area. But
Nafta is viewed more positively in the furniture industry around Grand
Rapids, which exports heavily to Mexico, as well as in Sault Sainte Marie in
Michigan's icy Upper Peninsula, which is growing fast on the strength of
open trade with its sister city in Ontario.
Bush campaign officials hope some of the local referendum issues which will
share the ballot on November 3 could draw out voters more favourable to the
president. These measures include proposals to cut property taxes, to limit
the number of terms that could be served by elected officials, and to roll
back car insurance rates in exchange for a cap on accident medical benefit
payments.
They are also optimistic about Republican chances in Michigan's
congressional elections. The state's population stagnated in the 1980s and,
in consequence, it lost two seats in the 10-yearly redistribution of seats
that takes effect this year.
The result has been to add Republican voters to the districts of several
Democratic congressmen. State Republican campaigners believe they have good
chances of ousting such incumbents as Congressmen Bob Carr, William Ford and
perhaps even David Bonior, the House majority whip.
Some even suggest that the prospect of victory in these congressional races
could stimulate Republican voters and help Mr Bush. Certainly, few expect
the traditional 'coat-tails' effect where the president helps his party's
candidates lower down the ticket.
'This is, has been and will remain an 'against' election, and not a 'for'
election,' says Prof Rohde.
But former Governor Blanchard, who is heading Mr Clinton's Michigan
campaign, knows from personal experience not to underestimate the electoral
skills of his old nemesis, Mr Engler.
Mr Blanchard must avoid the low turnout which cost him the 1990 governor's
election. That will require 'get out the vote' activities in heavily
Democratic Detroit city, but also among the 'Reagan Democrats' of Detroit's
blue-collar suburbs.
