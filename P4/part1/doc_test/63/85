THE 'EAR-MAN' AND HIS MOST AMAZING SKILL;

In the antic American presidential selection system, almost nothing tests a 
candidate's skills as a negotiator. The emphasis is all on trial by combat -- 
in the primaries against members of the same party, then in high-stakes debates 
against the opposing nominee in the general election. The unstated assumption 
seems to be that politics is a form of warfare, in which toughness and 
durability, the capacity to sustain blows and inflict injury, are the vital 
qualities. 
</P>
<P>
It truly is fortunate, then, to have a President with George Bush's negotiating 
skills. The testimony on this point -- from members of Congress and foreign 
officials -- is nearly unanimous. They find Bush well-briefed, engaged and 
self-confident enough to be flexible. He is described by associates as an 
ear-man, rather than an eye-man, one who prefers conversation on a topic to a 
set of memos or position papers. He governs by talking to people, face to face 
or over the phone. And he likes to deal. 
</P>
<P>
His own ego needs are well under control. He encourages those with whom he 
negotiates to advance their own ideas and gives them room to maneuver. Told as 
a youth that it is bad form to brag and inconsiderate to make others feel 
uncomfortable, Bush prides himself on his ability to build personal 
relationships. One difficult NATO leader has been converted into a reasonably 
strong supporter of U.S. policy by Bush's repeated acknowledgment of this man's 
erudition and intellect. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush is more than an artful flatterer, a convivial locker-room or 
cocktail-party pal. His real gift, those who deal with him say, is his capacity 
to "see the other guy's needs." He understands and respects the reasons why 
others at the table take the positions they do. 
</P>
<P>
By conveying that understanding, he was able to defuse a rather nasty 
London-Bonn feud at the NATO summit a year ago, where he made his international 
debut as President. At that Brussels meeting, Bush managed to line up both 
Great Britain and West Germany behind an American initiative for sweeping 
conventional arms cuts in Europe. That NATO offer, as it turned out, gave 
Gorbachev the assurance that he needed to let the Warsaw Pact countries break 
away late last year without fear of Soviet tanks. 
</P>
<P>
None of this guarantees success for the upcoming negotiations on the budget or 
on arms control. The policy problems in both are daunting. Nor is negotiating 
skill an adequate substitute for public rhetoric when it comes to leading a 
democracy. In a representative government like ours, the voters need to hear 
goals and strategies debated, not just bear mute witness to a leader's tactical 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, it is an advantage -- and something of a miracle -- to have a 
President who is a skilled negotiator, especially at a time when the government 
is divided and the world is going through an enormous upheaval. And Bush does 
have that skill.
