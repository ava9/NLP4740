</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By first vowing to end Nicaragua's cease-fire and then seeming to back away, 
President Daniel Ortega has managed at least to refocus attention on a problem 
the world had almost forgotten -- the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
But whether or not all-out war resumes, Ortega's move is a risk that could 
shift the onus for any new fighting from the U.S.-backed rebels onto his own 
government and undermine faith in an upcoming election that is crucial for 
reviving this nation's shattered economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Contras were shunted off Washington's agenda last spring by a bipartisan 
agreement to keep their army intact but passive through that election, 
scheduled for Feb. 25. Four Central American presidents then joined Ortega in 
signing an Aug. 7 accord to "demobilize" the Honduras-based rebels but offered 
no means to enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
With the war reduced to skirmishes, few outsiders cared that up to 10,000 
rebels remained under arms. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, however, the Contras have filtered into Nicaragua by the 
hundreds, warned rural people not to vote for Ortega, assassinated a candidate 
of the ruling Sandinistas in a small-town election and, in a sharp escalation 
eight days ago, killed 18 army reservists being trucked to register to vote, 
according to government officials and independent monitors. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega now faces demands by the Sandinista army to end a 19-month-old 
cease-fire. One of his aides said the army has proposed a blitzkrieg to drive 
the Contras back to Honduras by December, hoping that the final three months of 
the election campaign can be peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
But when Ortega used a summit meeting with President Bush and 14 other Western 
Hemisphere leaders in Costa Rica last Friday to announce a truce suspension as 
of Wednesday, he was ostracized for overreacting and suspected of maneuvering 
to cancel the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Ortega has fudged that impending date and downgraded his vow to 
"hit the Contras hard" from a decision to a threat. Speaking in the town of 
Rivas on Sunday, he insisted "we cannot keep turning the other cheek." But he 
also said that he is "analyzing the situation" while seeking firmer diplomatic 
support for disbanding the Contras, and added that he will announce a decision 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea was a mistake," an aide to Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez 
said Sunday. "We're still hoping he will back out of it." 
</P>
<P>
While the Contra attacks have brought the delicate process of peace through 
elections to a crisis, the burden of solving it seems to have fallen on Ortega. 
U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar said Saturday that he was 
"deeply worried" about "the inherent danger of renewed combat" here just days 
before the Security Council is to vote on a plan by the Central American 
presidents to station U.N. truce observers throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tricky situation for Ortega," said a foreign election observer in 
Managua. "The Sandinistas have right on their side, but as the government in 
power, they have more responsibility to keep the war from revving up. The 
Contras are beyond the law, but if the cease-fire breaks down, the government 
would be the villain of the piece." 
</P>
<P>
Signs of a government offensive are already showing. Reporters saw Sandinista 
military forces in trucks and jeeps take up positions on three sides of a rural 
Contra stronghold in Jinotega province Friday and then heard heavy fighting. 
Ten Contras were reported killed in a clash last week in Chontales. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and human rights monitors say a lightning offensive would be risky 
because once begun, it would be hard to shut off. They recall that the Contras 
waged their fiercest attacks against Sandinista civilian targets when the army 
tried to drive them over the border during a yearlong suspension of U.S. 
military aid in 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
They also believe that the psychological effect of Ortega's announcement could 
intensify the fighting or intimidate opposition candidates even if the army 
does not launch a major offensive. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been more effective to step up their counterattacks without 
declaring the cease-fire over," an Asian diplomat said. "Ortega's reasons are 
obviously more than military." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Sandinista officials said Ortega made his announcement during the 
summit to dramatize his anger over continuing Contra hostility. 
</P>
<P>
Since the cease-fire took hold in March, 1988, Ortega said, rebel attacks have 
left 736 dead and 1,153 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
"We hear that George Bush has pressure from the right wing in his country not 
to abandon the Contras," said a Foreign Ministry official. "Don't forget, we 
have pressure from our citizens to get rid of them. Outside Nicaragua everybody 
wants to pretend that the war is over. We have a lot of grieving mothers to 
prove otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
As in the past, however, Ortega miscalculated the international outcry against 
what, in political terms at home, seemed like a reasonable position. In 1985, 
for example, he visited Moscow to seek help in the face of declining economic 
assistance from the West. The trip came on the heels of a congressional vote to 
suspend Contra aid and prompted shocked lawmakers to reverse their decision. 
</P>
<P>
The spectacle of Ortega in army uniform at a summit honoring 100 years of 
democracy in pacifist Costa Rica, announcing a return to war, was equally 
shocking to the region's other leaders. Nobody supported him, and a joke 
circulated that he had come in a costume thinking it was already Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
"One can question the timing and the handling of (the announcement)," said Paul 
S. Reichler, a Washington attorney for the Sandinista government. "But the fact 
remains that the Contras are on a rampage. They are killing people." 
</P>
<P>
A Sandinista official conceded: "That message didn't come through as clear as 
Ortega hoped." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his considerable efforts to make peace with the Contras and hold 
internationally supervised elections, Ortega has been frustrated by lingering 
distrust abroad and a failure to secure Western aid to rebuild his destitute 
country. His recent tour of Mideast oil states gained no pledges of petroleum. 
A special conference between Nicaragua and potential Western donors set for 
this fall has been postponed until after the election. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Soviet Union has suspended arms shipments to Nicaragua and 
obliged East Germany to do likewise. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sandinistas have a strong feeling of isolation these days," the Asian 
diplomat said. "Because of this, they cannot sit quietly on the sidelines. When 
things go against them, they have a psychological need to do something drastic 
to attract attention." 
</P>
<P>
Although one of three polls published last week shows Ortega trailing his 
election rival and another shows him barely ahead, the diplomat and many other 
observers here doubt that Ortega wants to sabotage the election, as Secretary 
of State James A. Baker III suggested. They said Ortega knows his country 
cannot afford the diplomatic isolation that would result. 
</P>
<P>
But he is eager to exploit the new fighting to portray Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro, his chief opponent, as the candidate of aggression. In Costa Rica, he 
distributed a letter purportedly signed by Enrique Bermudez, the Contra 
commander, expressing support for Chamorro, the U.S.-supported presidential 
nominee of a 14-party opposition coalition. She has refused to call for 
disbanding the Contras or to condemn their recent attacks, saying she does not 
believe Sandinista accounts of the war. 
</P>
<P>
While this strategy strikes a responsive chord with Sandinista supporters, the 
likelihood of renewed warfare alarms others. 
</P>
<P>
"All we hear from Ortega is that we want peace, we want peace," said Emilio 
Villarreal, 56, who attended the president's speech Sunday at a baseball 
stadium in Rivas. "If that's what he wants, why doesn't he negotiate with the 
Contras instead of fighting them?" 
</P>
<P>
Others in the town, which is far from the war zone but feels the war's economic 
devastation, were confused by Ortega's remarks. They thought he was talking 
about an end to the fighting, not an end to the cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to hear it's ending," said Pablo Ulloa, 25. "We're tired of the 
war."
