has recast the foreign policy debate in this year's US presidential campaign

Foreign policy has a way of inserting itself into presidential elections.
The confrontation with Iraq and the tragedy in what was Yugoslavia may have
been boiling for months, but neither had quite thrust themselves into the
forefront of an election supposedly to be determined principally on domestic
issues. Yet, when either George Bush or Bill Clinton wakes up on the morning
of November 4, the loser may well find the names of both countries written
in the political obituaries. This was not in the pre-ordained script.
In the good old days of the cold war, the playing of the foreign policy card
in presidential elections was predictable. The Republican candidate would
accuse his Democratic opponent of being soft on communism, weak on defence
and, if pushed to the partisan extreme, would point out that US
participation in this century's three big wars (two global and Vietnam) was
initiated by Democratic presidents.
The Democrat would preach the virtues of an enlightened approach to the rest
of the world, based on humanitarian values, shared international
responsibilities and a leaner military establishment. Republicans used to
hold the United Nations in contempt and the Democrats half-heartedly would
extol it.
There have been variations on the basic theme, mostly from the Democrats. In
1960 John Kennedy sought to be 'tougher' than Richard Nixon over Cuba and
China, and in 1964 Lyndon Johnson got away with portraying Barry Goldwater
as a nuclear adventurist (which was not difficult). Jimmy Carter's
successful campaign of 1976 was probably the closest to the Democratic norm,
but he was swamped four years later by his own Iranian albatross and by
Ronald Reagan's equally classical Republican slogan of 'peace through
strength'. This was enough to carry George Bush to victory in 1988 even
though the 'evil empire' had become quite emollient. It still features in
his speeches today.
There are two quantum differences this year. First, the cold war is dead and
buried alongside the corpse of the Soviet Union, presenting a different set
of challenges to the presentation of foreign policy by the two candidates.
Second, as recent events merely confirmed, Mr Clinton does not fit the
Democratic type; indeed, he sometimes seems to have lifted a lot, with
nuances, from the Republican handbook.
The Clinton logic is to accept that the cold war is over, not to quibble
over why, but instead to try and solve new problems. Anthony Lake, his
foreign policy adviser, says: 'At a moment when history has turned,
experience is not necessarily the first qualification.' The Bush premise is
to explain why it was won, his role in the victory and to argue that the
experience gained is too invaluable to discard in still tricky times,
exemplified by Iraq and Bosnia.
This could make for a fascinating general dialectic if the country was
listening. As Mr Bush likes to point out with scorn, the Democratic nominee
devoted precisely 143 words - or one minute - of his 54-minute acceptance
speech to his convention to foreign policy. But Mr Clinton is probably
closer to the public ear than is Mr Bush, insulated in the White House
cocoon.
The president will make much of his Gulf war victory when he speaks to his
convention in Houston next week and is wheeling out Mr Reagan for an opening
night keynote address on foreign policy. But Mr Bush's own advisers concede
that things have changed to the point that military involvement between now
and election day, especially in a Balkan quagmire that few understand, might
produce little political profit. That credit, the argument goes, was used up
by the Gulf war and could only be restored by the removal, by whatever
mysterious hand, of Saddam Hussein.
Still, Mr Bush would be politically dumb not to capitalise on the fact that
only in foreign policy is he considered the more competent. If he can catch
Mr Clinton with his formal inexperience showing, he might be on to
something. Gerald Ford's silly mistake in the 1976 debate, when he asserted
there was no Soviet military subjection of Poland, knocked his campaign off
track for a fateful couple of weeks.
The problem is that many of Mr Clinton's positions differ little from his
own. Mr Clinton has always supported financial aid to Russia, even when his
party wanted it switched to US cities. He might be a little tougher on
China, a little gentler on Israel and, again recently, a little bolder on
Bosnia, but mostly he has supported whatever Mr Bush has said, including
over the latest confrontation with Saddam Hussein.
More than this, as in domestic policy, the Clinton foreign team has been
phenomenally quick with its responses, so that no allegation appears on the
evening news without an appropriate answer. When accused by the White House
of being 'reckless' for advocating selective, UN-sanctioned bombing to
relieve Sarajevo, there was Mr Clinton instantly citing an administration
source (Dick Cheney, the secretary of defence, no less) for having said
exactly the same thing. He now has Mr Bush himself to adduce in evidence.
When charged with equivocal support for the Gulf war, the immediate counter
was that Mr Bush's 'coddling' of the Iraqi president in the 1980s had not
done much good either.
This does make for entertaining verbal chess, demonstrating at least that Mr
Clinton is no Michael Dukakis, who had no foreign policy at all. But it
hardly amounts to the presentation of an alternative vision to set against
the Bush record, and it does not take account of the advantages from foreign
policy that any incumbent president can bring to bear on a domestic
electorate. Some of them may be more apparent than real, but in Mr Bush's
case this year these potentially include:
The Middle East. The axiomatic Republican target is to get 30 per cent of
the traditionally Democratic Jewish vote. Mr Clinton has been most
solicitous towards Jewish constituencies, not least by keeping the Rev Jesse
Jackson at arm's length, as well as by standing four-square behind Israel
even when Yitzhak Shamir was prime minister.
But that still looks thin compared with some of the achievements of the Bush
administration. Not for political nothing is Mr Yitzhak Rabin coming here
this week, with peace talks resuming in Washington on August 24. It is
likely that the Arab and Palestinian representatives would prefer a
continuation of the Bush approach to the uncertainties of a new US
administration.
Eastern Europe. There are, according to the 1990 census, 9.4m Americans of
Polish ancestry, 3.5m Czechs and Slovaks, 2.9m Russians, 1.6m Hungarians,
810,000 Lithuanians and 740,000 Ukrainians. Many are working-class Reagan
Democrats and many approve of Mr Bush's role in facilitating the transition
of their countries of origin to democracy. The Poles will take particular
note of the endorsement Mr Bush received in Warsaw last month from President
Lech Walesa.
Hispanics. More than 17m Americans speak Spanish as a first language. The
Cubans, concentrated in Florida, wholeheartedly approved of Mr Bush's
refusal to shake hands with Fidel Castro in Rio in June. The US-Mexican
business community supports the North American Free Trade Agreement, of
which Mr Clinton is increasingly critical, and may be influential in getting
out what is normally a low but Democratic-leaning Hispanic vote.
Western Europe. Mr Bush may try to call in some Euro-chips. He virtually
endorsed John Major before the UK elections, while previous German
chancellors have publicly preferred a Republican. But no post-Thatcher
European leader has much of a following in the US and Lady Thatcher's recent
column in The New York Times on Bosnia was not complimentary to Mr Bush. Mr
Clinton, neither an isolationist nor a protectionist, is also, for Europe,
probably the least threatening Democratic candidate in years.
But the political calculations must also be placed in a broader context.
Whatever Mr Bush and Mr Clinton say and hope, neither has succeeded yet in
laying out what might be described as anything other than the chapter
headings for their new world orders.
The sceptical foreign policy establishment view was very well put recently
by Winston Lord, the former US ambassador to China and chairman of a recent
commission sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace to
examine the US place in a changing world. 'Leaders and aspiring leaders have
taken two actions with respect to foreign policy - run away or run it down.
We see no coherent vision at home or abroad to guide us towards the next
century - not from the executive and not from Congress, not from the
president and not from his opponents,' he said.
Certainly neither talks much about the perennial issue of US military
presence overseas, though both accept it will be cut, more deeply by Mr
Clinton. Both support Nato as an article of faith, though they differ on the
edges of its role, and neither has broached the balance of the security
treaty with Japan. Mr Bush says Mr Clinton has already relegated the US to
the status of a second-class power, but the president has himself disowned
the Pentagon strategic blueprint which sought to preserve US military
hegemony. Both support the UN, with Mr Clinton recommending that Japan and
Germany be admitted to the Security Council.
Other foreign policy experts complain that the Republican administration
after 12 years in power has finally run out of steam and ideas, as witnessed
at the Munich summit and again by its recent hesitancy on both the Balkan
and Iraqi counts. James Baker, the secretary of state, may be good at
'fixing things' but he is presumably about to move back to manage the
troubled re-election campaign, itself, as Mr Clinton points out, a
reflection of Mr Bush's current priorities.
Mr Baker also has his critics. They cite his invisibility immediately after
the Kuwait invasion and his long disinterest in Yugoslavia and in the
Uruguay Round trade talks, in both cases only belatedly re-awakened. They
point to a lack of US clarity towards the faltering process of European
integration with the new democracies to its east. Mr Clinton sums it up by
describing an administration which has become 'rudderless and reactive'.
Neither candidate disagrees with the general proposition that for the US to
retain its pre-eminence, it must revitalise itself at home. But differences
over how best to accomplish this brings the election debate full circle to
where it started - with foreign policy on the margins and both candidates
saying 'trust me'. The debate was certainly more distinct when the cold war
was raging and, if push comes to shove in either the Balkans or Iraq, it may
become more distinct again.
