  [Text] The Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican 
Movement] party political committee decided unanimously to 
support [former Comptroller General] Ruben Dario Carles' 
presidential candidacy after negotiations to bring about an 
alliance with the Arnulfist Party [PA] failed. 
  Molirena President Alfredo Ramirez indicated that after 
several hours of deliberations the party's political committee 
decided to select Carles as the presidential candidate because 
he represented the best option. 
  Ramirez stated that, unfortunately, conversations with the 
PA 
had not progressed. For several months now Molirena has been 
stating its intention to participate in the May 1994 elections 
with its own candidate. At the same time, Ramirez pointed out 
that Molirena also seeks to occupy the first vice presidency of 
any ticket that supports Carles' candidacy. In order to 
accomplish this, it has designated a commission to prepare a 
list of nominees from which Carles can chose the person most 
suited to occupy the position of first vice president. 
  A Molirena source reported that possible first vice 
president 
nominees include former Labor Minister Jorge Ruben Rosas, former 
Housing Minister Guillermo Quijano, and National Assembly 
President Arturo Vallarino. According to the same source, Carles 
could opt for Guillermo Quijano as first vice president and 
Tomas Herrera, member [and president] of the Civic Renewal Party 
as second vice president. 
  As of today, Ruben Dario Carles' candidacy will be supported 
by three parties: National Renewal, Civic Renewal, and Molirena. 
  Meanwhile, First Vice President Guillermo Ford indicated 
that 
he will continue to carry out his duties as a member of 
President Endara's cabinet. At the same time he accepted the 
Molirena political committee's decision and reiterated that he 
plans to continue being a member of said party. Ford said that 
he will continue serving democracy until 1 September 1994 when 
the new government is expected to be inaugurated. The vice 
president stipulated that together with President Endara he 
expects to guarantee clean and fair elections as an aftermath of 
the administration elected in 1989. 
  On the other hand, it was disclosed that those cabinet 
ministers who are Molirena members have no plans to resign their 
current positions and indicated that they will step down if it 
is specifically requested by President Endara. 
  Molirena is expected to hold its national convention today 
at 
the ATLAPA Convention Center and to ratify the decision made by 
the party's political committee. The party is expected to hold 
internal elections on 30 January to select candidates for 
legislators, corregimiento representatives, mayors, and council 
representatives.
