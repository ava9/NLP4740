After stepping out of a naturalization ceremony, one of the first sights a new 
Vietnamese-American citizen in Orange County will likely see is a Republican 
voter registration table. 
</P>
<P>
County Republicans sent the first Vietnamese-American delegate to their party's 
national convention in 1988. And the GOP has opened a campaign office in 
Westminster's Little Saigon during every election since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Vice President Dan Quayle will continue the party's aggressive effort to 
win the political hearts of the county's rapidly growing Southeast Asian 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle is scheduled to attend the opening of the Asian-American Republican 
Headquarters in Westminster, where leaders of the Vietnamese and Korean 
communities will launch voter registration efforts for the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle will be joined by California's Republican gubernatorial candidate, Pete 
Wilson, who helped open the same headquarters during his successful 1988 U.S. 
Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been very conscious in terms of outreach to the Asian community for 
some years, knowing the Asian population is growing," said county Republican 
Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes. "We think the Southeast Asian community has a very 
strong potential for growing its ranks within the Republican Party." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other parts of California, the Asian community in Orange County is made 
up largely of Vietnamese and Koreans. There are about 120,000 
Vietnamese-Americans in Orange County, the largest concentration of Vietnamese 
outside their native country. And just blocks away is the nation's 
second-largest Korean community with about 80,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Republicans detected a sympathy for their politics among the 
newly arrived Vietnamese shortly after the community began to grow in the early 
1980s. Many refugees were attracted to the hard-line anti-communist politics of 
President Reagan and later, to Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
But even with its rapid growth, the Asian population still represents barely 6% 
of Dornan's congressional district and an even smaller portion of the 
registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
Ky Ngo, the Vietnamese delegate to the 1988 Republican convention, said of his 
community's GOP bent: "We know more than 95% vote Republican. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason most people register Republican is that it is strongly 
anti-communist," he said. "We are the Vietnamese refugees, we escaped 
communists, we escaped from oppression." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the Republican effort is an investment in the future, as the county's 
Asian community grows. For this election, however, the GOP is aiming at the 
closely fought reelection of Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) who 
represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats have also launched a registration drive in the Vietnamese community 
on behalf of Pringle's opponent, Tom Umberg. Umberg's campaign manager, George 
Urch, said they have three Vietnamese-speaking workers assigned to register 
voters. 
</P>

<P>
QUAYLE'S ITINERARY
