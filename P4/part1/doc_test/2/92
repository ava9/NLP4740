Cleveland Indians Manager Doc Edwards, his team 14 1/2 games out of first 
place, was fired today and replaced on an interim basis by special assignment 
scout John Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Hart was third base coach last season at Baltimore and was brought to Cleveland 
as a scout this year by Indians President Hank Peters, who was formerly general 
manager of the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards' dismissal was announced by Peters, who said, "This is not a 
particularly happy occasion for me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
54-54 at Mid-Summer 
</P>
<P>
Edwards had kept the Indians in contention through mid-summer with Cleveland 
54-54 and 1 1/2 games out of first place on Aug. 4. Since then the team went 
11-24. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians lost back-to-back extra-inning games to division-leading Toronto on 
Saturday and Sunday. The team has lost 12 of 14 extra-inning games this season. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend losses dropped the Indians to 14 1/2 games out of first place in 
the American League East division and 13 games under .500. Both marks were the 
worst of the season for Cleveland, which had Monday off. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians went into Tuesday night's start of a home series against Detroit 
with a 65-78 record, in sixth place in the division. 
</P>
<P>
Through Sunday's loss, the Indians had lost eight of their last 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, 52, was named Cleveland's 33rd manager July 16, 1987, replacing Pat 
Corrales. Last year, his first full season with the Indians, the team went 
78-84, a 17-win improvement over the 1987 season.
