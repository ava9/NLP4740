<P>
The United Church of Christ, based in New York City since the denomination was 
formed by merger in 1957, opened its new headquarters here this week. 
</P>
<P>
Three top officers and skeleton crews of several national agencies have shifted 
work here. 
</P>
<P>
Three floors of the headquarters building at 700 Prospect Ave. are being 
renovated to provide working space for about 90 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Further renovations start in March. Altogether, national offices of the 1.6 
million-member denomination have about 350 employees, most of them based in New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
The two largest agencies are remaining there through 1990, the Board for 
Homeland Ministries and Board for World Ministries, but will began shifting 
some personnel to Cleveland in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The move from New York City to Cleveland was approved in July by the church's 
legislative general synod.
