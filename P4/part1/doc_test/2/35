Five years ago, a 'Triumph of Death' was found hanging in the bedroom of a
reclusive American multi-millionaire. The large canvas was clearly an old
copy of Breughel the Elder's famous painting in the Prado - dirty, damaged,
and badly repainted in the last century. Cleaning has now revealed it to be
a signed and dated version by Breughel's son, Pieter II. On June 18, it went
on view at the Museum Mayer van den Bergh in Antwerp until May next year.
A painting as macabre as Breughel's 'Triumph of Death' would not be
everyone's choice for a bedroom. However, its late owner was a remarkable
character. Peter Putnam was born into a wealthy family in Cleveland, Ohio.
As a young man, he renounced the comforts of wealth, working as a
theoretical physicist, a college lecturer and social worker, all the while
elaborating a complex theory reconciling science, morality and religion.
Yet Putnam was also a brilliant investor. He turned Dollars 7m into a
Dollars 40m fortune by the time of his death. Aged 62, Putnam was cycling
home from his job as a night-janitor in a small town in Louisiana when he
was struck by a car and killed.
Putnam and his adored mother Mildred were philanthropically inclined. Last
month, the American charity Nature Conservancy revealed that the cornerstone
of its Last Great Places appeal was a secret Dollars 38m bequest in the
wills of Putnam and his mother. Princeton University, where Peter graduated,
is dotted with the Putnam Collection of sculpture, presented as a memorial
to Peter's brother.
The redoubtable Mildred Putnam gave a quantity of 20th-century art to
Princeton, Cleveland Museum and elsewhere. Not all the beneficiaries showed
themselves grateful. Kent State University declined a piece she commissioned
from George Segal in memory of the four students shot by the National Guard
at the 1970 anti-Vietnam War protest. Mrs Putnam not only accepted her son's
homosexuality, she commissioned Segal for a piece honouring the Gay
Liberation Movement, which conservative Ohio did not wish to have. The
sculpture now stands in New York's Greenwich Village.
The residue of the Putnam fortune, including the 'Triumph of Death', now
belongs to a charitable foundation which Peter named after his mother. James
Corcoran, an American art-dealer, is master-minding the re-emergence of a
picture he estimates as worth between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m. The Mayer van
den Bergh makes an extremely good shop-window for it, being rich in works by
the Breughel family.
Fritz Mayer van den Bergh was an ardent admirer of Breughel the Elder at a
time - the 1890s - when others were lukewarm. The wealthy young aesthete was
able to buy for a song what is perhaps the most remarkable and mysterious of
all the elder Brueghel's apocalyptic visions. 'Dulle Griet', the armed
harridan who strides across a ghastly landscape of bloodshed and fire, makes
an apt pair for the Cleveland 'Triumph of Death'.
Pieter the Younger and Jan each copied the 'Triumph of Death', Jan twice and
Pieter, it now appears, three times. They saw no difficulty about altering
their father's composition. Certain changes are aesthetic. In the elder
Breughel's day, skeletons were shown with flesh on their bones; his sons'
creations are bone-naked. However, Pieter put clothes on his father's naked
Eve, and had second thoughts about a dead baby. However, if two Belgian
art-historians are correct, Pieter included other changes which make the
Cleveland picture far more than just a ghoulish pot-boiler.
Helene Verougstraete and Roger Van Schoute have suggested that Pieter was
painting a double-memorial. In 1625, the year before the newly-uncovered
date on the canvas, Jan and three of Jan's children died from cholera.
Another date is prominent in the picture; 1525, marked on funeral banners
carried by a procession of skeletons, together with two crossed bones and
the legend 'Obiit morte(m)', 'He has passed on.' What was the significance
of the date?
The suggestion is that Pieter was marking the centenary which had elapsed
between his brother Jan's demise and the birth of their father, Breughel the
Elder. If this view is correct, it pinpoints the master's date of birth
which is normally given only as 'circa 1524'. On the right of the painting,
the merry company interrupted by skeletons, is also cited in support of this
centennial thesis. Ten sprigs on the handsome gateau must commemorate 10
decades.
Pieter, it is claimed, had painted a masterpiece heavy with personal meaning
 -one last 'Triumph of Death' for the Breughels. Perhaps the theory is
correct, although is there any other evidence of 17th-century artists
marking family centenaries in this way? It seems far from obvious that a
bereaved person would remark a 100-year interval between a father's birth
and a brother's death.
Where Breughel the Elder's birthday is concerned, the theory may be
mistaken. However, the notion that a mourning brother painted the Cleveland
'Triumph' as a memorial certainly has poignancy, not least in terms of the
other Peter. Putnam bought his painting (sold as school of Breughel) when he
was about 20, touring Europe. Some four years earlier, in 1944, his adored
elder brother had been killed serving as a fighter pilot.
It is impossible not to think that Breughel the Elder's message struck to
the wealthy young man's heart. On two scrolls, Pieter had added to his
father's work the quotations from the Apocalypse and Ecclesiastes which it
illustrated so unforgettably; 'There came a pale horse whose rider's name is
Death, and Hades followed after him' and 'For man is on the way to his
eternal home.' Breughel's fearsome vision kept a 20th-century ascetic
company for the rest of his days.
