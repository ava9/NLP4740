SCHOOL DRESS CODES: A COLORFUL, SOBERING LESSON IN HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED

The school dress code was simple when I was in grammar school during the early 
1960s: clean shirts and ties for boys, uniforms for girls. That was at St. 
Christopher Grade School in Rocky River, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
That code now seems quaint alongside the strict rules that Jackson Elementary 
School at 54th Street and El Cajon Boulevard instituted March 9. Jackson 
students are now prohibited from wearing colors and particular items of 
clothing that are favored by gangs. 
</P>
<P>
I never once breached the St. Christopher dress code, so I don't know what 
happened to offenders. But my kindergarten son, Tim, has a working 
understanding of what might happen should he breach Jackson's new dress code: 
Gangs of kids might beat you up if you wear the wrong color, he told me last 
week. When I parroted the advice that parents traditionally offer -- find an 
adult if a problem arises -- he nonchalantly advised me that gangs beat up 
adults and police, too. 
</P>
<P>
So, when Tim picks out his clothes in the morning, we now must remember which 
colors and combinations are on the forbidden list and dress him accordingly. My 
son -- a dark-horse candidate who won a "Good Citizen" award during February -- 
doesn't wear outfits that are exclusively red, blue or green. He doesn't wear 
baseball caps or bandannas, and he doesn't wear colored shoelaces in his tennis 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Tim was confused by the dress code. At first, he thought the 
principal wanted students to wear gang colors. My wife explained that the 
opposite was true. Tim then wondered if he'd ever be able to wear his favorite 
red shirt. We explained that only outfits that include red shirts, red pants 
and red shoes are forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
That settled him down a bit. But it remains very confusing for this particular 
kindergartner. 
</P>
<P>
The new dress code is designed to ensure "a safe environment for all students," 
according to a letter Tim carried home from Jackson Principal R. J. Cunningham. 
"Students wearing any of the (banned) clothing will be asked to remove the item 
or they may be taken home to change their clothing." 
</P>
<P>
The dress code was instituted because "we are seeing increasing evidence of our 
students identifying with certain gang behavior," Cunningham wrote. "Some of 
our students have been found wearing clothing which is associated with gang 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
For parents, the dress code is a sad, but not surprising, byproduct of San 
Diego's growing gang problem. 
</P>
<P>
Last year in San Diego, 96 drive-by shootings killed eight people and left 54 
others injured. The Police Department, which estimates San Diego's gang 
population at about 2,000, recently formed an 86-member Special Enforcement 
Division to identify and arrest gang members. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, gang members are heavily involved in the city's booming 
drug business. Many carry handguns, and some have automatic machine guns 
capable of firing 400 rounds a minute. 
</P>
<P>
That is a far cry from the neighborhood tough guys I worried about during grade 
school. Danny Coyne was the toughest guy at Impett Park, a playground on 
Cleveland's West Side. He once cornered my brother and me in a neighbor's 
garage, where we hid for several hours. But, when supper approached, my brother 
bravely confronted Danny to win our freedom. 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, my friends and I fought to keep outsiders from "our" park. But the 
only weapons were fists and rocks, and the only injuries were an occasional 
bruise and some hurt feelings. 
</P>
<P>
In large part, growing up in Cleveland was remarkably similar to "The Wonder 
Years," a television show that chronicles the coming of age of a grade-school 
boy growing up in a suburban setting during the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than just miles and time between St. Christopher Grade School, 
circa 1961, and Andrew Jackson Elementary School in 1989. And for that reason, 
I'm not very well equipped to offer gang-related advice to my kindergarten son. 
</P>
<P>
I grew up in all-white sections of Cleveland. In contrast, the principal's 
notes that Tim carries home are written in Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, 
Spanish and English. 
</P>
<P>
Tim's schoolmates are card-carrying members of Jesse Jackson's Rainbow 
Coalition. And it is with them that Tim is forging his own decade of "Wonder 
Years." But I wonder, if these children are worrying about gangs at age 6, what 
kind of memories they will have to relish in their later years.
