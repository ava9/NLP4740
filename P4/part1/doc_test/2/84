MILLVILLE, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tall smokestacks of glass factories oversee this weary town, beckoning each 
new generation into the plants where their fathers spent their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Millville High School is preparing to remit its June quota to the factories, 
and to the shops and stores that feed on the factory paychecks. The quota is 
smaller now; more graduating seniors go to college. But many still stay to take 
their places beside their fathers. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Scarlato will stay. The 18-year-old was planning to take a bittersweet 
walk in cap and gown this month to the stage set up on the school football 
field to collect his diploma and leave a time that he will never recapture, but 
always remember. His life, as he sees it, now will be a reflection of his 
father's: a life of work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
57% Headed for College 
</P>
<P>
About 2.8 million teen-agers will graduate from high school this month. Of 
those, about 57% will keep going to school in a two- or four-year college. 
Others will go into the military, raise families or do nothing. And about one 
in three will leave the graduation ceremony to go to a job. 
</P>
<P>
For those young men and women, high school graduation is a sudden doorway. One 
day they are in a miniworld of football and friends. The next day, they enter 
an unforgiving world of bosses and bills and responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to hit them between the eyes," said Wayne Ingling, one of four 
guidance counselors for the 1,600 students at Millville High School. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Scarlato approaches the doorway eyes open, eager. "I'm going to miss 
school. I'll miss friends, sports, coaches. But I'm glad to get out. No more 
homework. No more rules for things like dress codes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
End of Hard Work 
</P>
<P>
"Graduation does mean something." He broke into a delighted smile. "It means 
the end of a lot of hard work." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin is confident bordering on brash. He made a success of high school: his 
B-average grades were tops in his vocational class; he played football and 
track; and his lean, muscular good looks were such that his mother said: "I've 
listened to more than one broken-hearted girlfriend crying on the phone." 
</P>
<P>
"He's a smart kid, a pretty good kid," comes the typical assessment from one of 
his teachers. Not perfect: his parents have been called to school more than 
once to hear about minor infractions. 
</P>
<P>
For Kevin, there was never any doubt about what he would do after high school. 
The pattern was set by his father, and his older brother. Since 1955, the 
Scarlatos have run the garage and filling station near their home in tiny 
Cedarville, a small community nine miles from Millville, and have run the 
heating oil delivery business there. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin would go to an auto mechanic's school in Cleveland, Ohio, for nine 
months, and then return to work with his brother and father in the white-gable, 
three-bay station. 
</P>
<P>
"I like auto mechanics," he said. "It's fun. It's easy. It's good money." He 
picks it up quickly, said his auto shop teacher, Robert Chambers. "Things come 
real easily to Kevin," Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
His career choice was not an offhand decision. Kevin's mother wanted him to go 
to college. "This kid has a real quick mind for math," she said. "My neighbor's 
kid is an accountant and he's done real well." But Kevin's decision is an 
affirmation of respect for the honest work done by his father, and the elder 
Scarlato quietly notes the honor. He is willing to pay the $10,000 it will cost 
to send Kevin to the top-rated trade school in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'College Wasn't for Me' 
</P>
<P>
"College just wasn't me," Kevin said. "It isn't interesting to me to go to 
school for 12 years, and college for another four. I had in my mind what I 
wanted to do with my life." 
</P>
<P>
And he knows where he wants to do it. "Leave town?" Kevin ponders the question, 
quizzically. "No, I don't plan on leaving." 
</P>
<P>
There are many graduates who decline the leave-home mobility of the age, and 
choose to stay in Millville and the tiny communities like Cedarville that 
surround it. "We see so many kids that just stay and become 'townies,' " said 
Ingling. "It seems like it's hard to leave Millville." 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1979, only one in four graduates of Millville High School 
planned to continue to college. Of last year's graduating class, 55% did. 
Warren Elliott, the principal of Millville High School, who graduated from the 
old high school three years before the present school was built in 1964, thinks 
the painful economic downturn of the early 1980s and the disillusioning strike 
helped change attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the family now looks at a kid going to college as a way out, as a way 
to get by the economic troubles," Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no shame in Millville in going from high school to work. Wheaton 
Glass, the largest glass factory and biggest employer here, sniffs somewhat 
disdainfully at further schooling. The company has a record of promoting 
factory workers into management, and for most of their work force, "we would 
not be looking for people who have a large amount of community college," said 
David Slack, chief administrator of the company. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who wants a job can get it" right out of high school, said Mike 
Lascarides, who is in charge of promoting economic development in Millville. 
The town has brought new industries here, but "in the last two to three years, 
my problem is not as much providing the industry as providing the work force," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it was the lure of family, not fortune, that kept Michael Scarlato here. 
His grandfather had emigrated from Italy, stopped in Philadelphia, and settled 
in Cedarville to grow vegetables. His father, Anthony, kept up the farm, but 
then began delivering kerosene -- carrying it in pails from the truck -- and 
bought the filling station in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Scarlato carried on the family business. His son Brian, two years older 
than Kevin, graduated from Millville High School and is now running the repair 
shop in the garage while Scarlato runs the three fuel-oil delivery trucks. 
Kevin's imminent arrival in the family business is a continuation of the family 
legacy that touches a chord of pride in the elder Scarlato. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I am proud of them. I am proud they want to be with me, and work with 
me," said the barrel-chested father, 51. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the privilege of being with my father, of working for 20-some years 
together. Dad has been dead six years now. I tell you what, I miss him. If I 
had a problem, I could talk to him. If I had to make a decision, I could ask 
him. All of a sudden, you're the top dog, and there's nobody to talk to." 
</P>
<P>
Both Mike Scarlato and his wife, Helen, can point from their yard to where they 
grew up. Helen Scarlato's father worked in the glass factory. She had dreams of 
leaving Cedarville. "I always thought of what was out there, maybe in 
California." But the demands of raising a family somehow consumed the years. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever my kids were in, I made sure we backed them up," she said. She worked 
in the grammar school cafeteria when they were young, and then shuttled them 
back and forth to sports practices in Millville when they went to high school. 
"I've been there for them. I'm there in the mornings, there at night." 
</P>
<P>
Both sons have worked in the garage during summers and weekends, but their 
parents have not pushed the obligation. "We told our kids to enjoy high 
school," said Mrs. Scarlato. "These are the fun years." 
</P>
<P>
Have they been? Kevin shrugs, then assents. "Sports was the most fun," he said. 
"You're with a group of guys, and even at practice when you're running, 
running, running, you always had fun." At only 165 pounds, Kevin still was 
tenacious enough to play both offensive guard and defensive end, and was named 
to the all-conference football team this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Football Rivalry 
</P>
<P>
He will, he said, always remember the big game of their championship year. 
Kevin was a junior, and Holy Spirit, the big parochial school from the 
adjoining county, was rolling to another in its string of conference titles. It 
was a team Kevin and his teammates could love to hate. "Spirit's the only team 
that hits you cheap every play." 
</P>
<P>
"They were No. 1 in South Jersey, and we weren't even ranked," Kevin said. 
"They had all the nice, fancy uniforms. They had all the talk. But we knew we 
could beat them." 
</P>
<P>
It snowed and rained in the week before the game, but the Millville team grimly 
practiced as Holy Spirit relaxed. "They weren't expecting us." Saturday morning 
dawned fair and sunny as the teams took the field. "On the first play of the 
game, we had a 4-foot-11 guy who ran downfield and just crushed a 6-footer on 
their team. That set the tone for the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
Millville won 25 to 12, and with it the conference championship. "We rubbed it 
in their face. It was so fun," he said. "I'll remember it forever." 
</P>
<P>
There are many for whom the big game at high school remains a highwater mark in 
their life. The challenges of adulthood may be more weighty, but not more 
dramatic nor exciting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Hold on to Friends 
</P>
<P>
Kevin does not intend to let go of those memories, or of the friends he has in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll stay in touch," he said with certainty. "We all said we'd like to come 
back and be at the football games and the track meets, to be around. I won't be 
playing but I'll be there." 
</P>
<P>
He is less certain about other aspects of his life after graduation. First on 
the agenda is trade school, Ohio Auto Diesel Technical Institute in Cleveland, 
which will send him away from home for nine months for the first time in his 
life.
