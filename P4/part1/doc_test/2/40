The Baltimore Orioles have found a surprise stopper. He is Dave Johnson, a 
29-year-old rookie right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson got his second consecutive complete game victory Sunday as Baltimore 
beat the Boston Red Sox, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Worthington hit a two-run home run and Johnson pitched a six-hitter as 
the Orioles increased their lead in the East to 2 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
The performance gave a lift to a struggling team that had used up its pitching 
staff in a 13-inning loss to the Red Sox 13 hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
As their lead in the East faded, the Orioles brought Johnson up from Rochester 
and started him Aug. 1 at Boston. Although he had impressive minor league 
statistics, his only previous chance in the majors came with Pittsburgh in 
1987. He pitched 6 1/3 innings of relief, all in games already out of hand, and 
had an earned-run average of 9.95 before being shipped back to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was shelled in his debut. But when the Orioles gave him another chance 
at home against Minnesota last Tuesday, he went the distance for a 6-1 victory, 
giving the bullpen a needed rest. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the time we needed a complete game," pitching coach Al Jackson said. 
"We used seven pitchers last night. He saved us." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a Baltimore native, pitched at Memorial Stadium in a high school 
all-star game when he was 18. He and his wife live in a trailer park in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, when I return to Baltimore, I get a job driving a truck until 
spring," Johnson said. "Now I go to work at the ball park. My wife and I look 
at each other two or three times a day, and its like we don't realize what's 
happening. Nothing could be better than this." 
</P>
<P>
Boston Manager Joe Morgan, who used to drive a snowplow in the off-season, was 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a great job," he said. "He had a lot of stamina. It looked like he was 
out of gas a couple of times, but he kept going." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox split the four-game series. Wade Boggs, their best hitter, went 
three for 20. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 5, Cleveland 4 -- Among the teams in a position to challenge the 
Orioles in the East, the Brewers have shown the most signs that they are 
capable of making a run. 
</P>
<P>
Although the usually reliable Dan Plesac failed to hold a lead in the ninth at 
Cleveland, the Brewers came back to win in the 10th on a sacrifice fly by Robin 
Yount. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth victory in the last six games for the Brewers, putting them in 
a three-way tie for second with Toronto and Boston, 2 1/2 games behind. 
</P>
<P>
Plesac, who had saved 14 games in a row, was upset when two singles and a 
sacrifice fly by Brad Komminsk tied the score in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 8, Toronto 3 -- Royals Jose Tartabull and Bo Jackson hit home runs 
at Kansas City, but the go-ahead run came when Brad Wellman scored on a wild 
pitch in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Tom Gordon pitched a strong seven innings and when the Royals scored 
four times in the seventh, his record improved to 14-4. 
</P>
<P>
New York 9, Minnesota 7 -- About the time it appears the Yankees are done, they 
manage to stay alive in the East. 
</P>
<P>
They trailed, 7-3, going into the eighth inning at Minneapolis. But Steve Sax 
singled to start a four-run rally that tied the score, then walked to begin a 
ninth-inning uprising that won it. 
</P>
<P>
New York's Jesse Barfield singled in two runs in the eighth and doubled home 
two in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 6, Seattle 4 -- Carlton Fisk drove in four runs at Seattle and hit the 
White Sox's first home run this month. 
</P>
<P>
Fisk hit a three-run homer in the fourth, but it was Ozzie Guillen's single in 
the eighth that broke a tie. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 4, Rangers 2 -- Lou Whitaker's tie-breaking two-run single with two out 
in the ninth inning gave the Tigers a win over the Rangers in Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
With two out, Mike Brumley singled off reliever Kenny Rogers, 2-2, who was 
replaced by Texas relief ace Jeff Russell. However, Brumley stole second and 
Russell walked Gary Pettis and hit Dave Bergman with a pitch to load the bases. 
Whitaker singled to center on a 1-2 pitch. DAN HAFNER
