"Communism, Corruption and Korea!" 
</P>
<P>
That was the attack theme of the 1952 campaign, which swept Harry S. Truman's 
party out of the White House and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The "mess in Washington" that Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard M. Nixon 
assailed was the scandal that erupted over influence-peddling by the Truman 
"cronies" known as the "five-percenters." For a 5% fee, they had been steering 
clients to the right people on the Hill, in the Cabinet and at the White House 
to get that federal contract. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years after the scandal, influence-peddling has become a richly rewarded 
and honored way of life in Washington. In a 1983 Harper's piece, "There's No 
Shame Anymore," Robert Kaus wrote of "a new air of freedom and independence." 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives who came to Washington to battle Big Government lobby for 
subsidies to Big Business. Liberals who came to regulate corporate power lobby 
to exempt Fortune 500 companies from rules they wrote themselves. 
</P>
<P>
They came to Washington to do good, and stayed on to do well. 
</P>
<P>
Now the downward spiral deepens. Law and public-relations firms are boldly 
taking on as clients Communist governments like Angola, and Communist parties, 
like Hungary's. Japan, Inc., in its battle for economic supremacy with the 
United States, has recruited, at great cost, a fifth column of mercenaries -- 
ex-Cabinet officers, former White House aides and U.S. senators -- and sent it 
into the halls of the federal government to do battle for the Empire of the 
Rising Sun. 
</P>
<P>
According to John Judis in the New Republic, in the last two years, through its 
agencies, foundations and multinationals, Japan pumped $400 million into U.S. 
universities, think tanks, law firms and PR firms to buy a better image and 
influence the government decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese have hired more than 110 former government officials," Judis 
writes. "Almost every important ex-trade official works for the Japanese in 
some capacity. These include three former U.S. trade representatives: (William) 
Eberle, William E. Brock III, who advises Toyota, and Robert S. Strauss . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the top Democrat and Republican Party officials work for the Japanese. 
Last December, when the Democratic Party was going to choose a chairman, three 
of its four leading candidates -- Ronald H. Brown and former Reps. James R. 
Jones and Michael D. Barnes -- all represented Japanese firms. Former 
Democratic chair Charles T. Manatt represents Japanese firms, and when Hogan 
&amp; Hartson's (law firm) Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. was Republican chair, he 
helped one of his law firm's clients gain entree to Commerce."

When Toshiba had sold Moscow the secret technology that enabled our submarines 
to run silent -- thereby putting at risk the American kids who volunteer for 
this dangerous Navy duty -- an enraged Senate voted 92-5 to bar Toshiba sales 
for three years. The Tokyo executives quickly funneled $10 million to their 
American lobbyists, who persuaded Congress to settle for a slap on the wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Do American companies hire ex-Japanese cabinet officers and Diet members to 
lobby for U.S. interests in Tokyo? 
</P>
<P>
No way. "In Japan," writes Judis, "no self-respecting lawyer, let alone former 
government official, is willing to lobby for an American company. 'They would 
be seen as paid men,' one Japanese official said. But what is culturally and 
morally forbidden in Japan is accepted procedure in contemporary Washington. 
'In Washington,' Chalmers Johnson says, 'the fix is always in.' " 
</P>
<P>
In America today, a great debate is under way between free traders and those 
who hold that trade policy should be an arm of U.S. foreign policy. Is it not a 
massive corruption of that debate if some of the participants, who loudly 
invoke Adam Smith and Milton Friedman, are themselves the hired men of 
protectionist Japan? 
</P>
<P>
In Washington today, paid lobbyists and registered agents of foreign powers 
grow annually in number and influence. As they do, what was once grandly called 
the "national interest" of the United States is forgotten, and U.S. foreign 
policy and trade policy reflect more and more only the brokered compromises 
among the armies of mercenaries. 
</P>
<P>
When the Old American Republic disappeared into the global American empire, 
tell me again, what did we get, for all we lost?
