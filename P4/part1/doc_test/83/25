JOSEPH N. BELL: RESERVISTS ADOPT A HEALTHIER VIEW OF MILITARY CRAP SHOOT

Last week's call-up of military reserves by President Bush struck some painful 
chords here. It reminded me of a period from mid-1950 through 1951 when 
President Harry Truman did the same thing. And I was sitting on the catbird 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, there were two types of miliary reservists: active and inactive 
(they go by different names today). The active reservists were the weekend 
warriors, the men and women who drilled once a month, went to a two-week summer 
camp and continued to be an integral part of the military. For this they were 
paid, and the time could also be accumulated to provide for a higher rank and a 
substantial pension after 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The inactive reserve was made up of people like me who developed certain skills 
during World War II that were deemed vital enough that we weren't permitted out 
of the reserves. There was nothing voluntary about our reserve status. We were 
in because they wouldn't let us out. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted out. I had spent four years on active duty in World War II and had 
amassed almost 2,000 flying hours when the war ended. I was saturated with both 
the military and flying, and I wanted to be a civilian again as soon as 
possible. The peacetime military held no charm for me. 
</P>
<P>
So in the five years between the end of World War II and the beginning of the 
Korean War, I was surely the most inactive reservist in military history. There 
were times I didn't even read my mail from the military. When I went back to 
college at war's end, I was married and had one child. When Korea came along, I 
had three children, a mortgage on a house and my first decent-paying job. I was 
beginning to sell writing to magazines and taking part in another war -- 
especially one as fuzzy as the Korean conflict -- was rock bottom on the list 
of things I wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
Most of my World War II buddies felt the same way -- but not all of them took 
the same route. There were two groups in particular who were attracted to the 
active reserve. First, those who were still enamored of flying and wanted the 
chance to play with military aircraft free of charge. And, second, those who 
wanted to build up rank and hang out with the reserves until they could collect 
retirement pay. 
</P>
<P>
There seemed little risk in the active reserve route then. After all, we'd just 
brought two superpowers to their knees and won the second war to end wars. 
Surely there would be a long enough grace period for these veterans to reach 
retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
The reasoning was OK, and if I hadn't been so turned off by the military, I 
might have considered it, too. But my first day of the peacetime Navy gave me 
all the inkling I needed. The day after the Japanese surrendered, officers were 
ordered to begin wearing ties at all times on the crummy island where I was 
then stationed. And shortly thereafter, my return home was almost delayed 
because I had lost two pieces of flight gear that the Navy routinely burned 
when it was turned in. 
</P>
<P>
So when Truman began calling up the reserves to go to Korea, the bleats from my 
peers who chose to remain in the active reserves were loud and anguished. And 
that's when I began to develop the hard-nosed attitude I have today about 
weekend warriors. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever reason prompts a person to join the reserves -- patriotism, money, 
retirement, the chance to sharpen skills or play war without danger, a need to 
get away from the old lady or the old man -- there is also a risk implicit in 
that decision: the risk that they may be called to active duty for a multitude 
of reasons. That's why I don't feel particularly sorry for them if that 
happens. It's a crap shoot, and you win some and lose some. 
</P>
<P>
But I felt pretty sorry for myself during the Korean War because the Truman 
call-up reached into many thousands of inactive reservists. We had a pretty 
good network going among ourselves and we knew when inactive reservists with 
our skills began getting called up. 
</P>
<P>
It was a miserable year for me. I dreaded going home to look at the mail, and I 
was paranoid about telegrams. A lot of my inactive reservist buddies went to 
Korea, and some of them were killed. But this time the dice rolled right for 
me. I was never called. 
</P>
<P>
After Korea the risk of being sent into combat as a reservist went down 
considerably, even though we spent almost 10 years bogged down militarily in 
Vietnam. The Establishment reason was that we needed the reserves as a backup 
force at home for trouble spots that might develop elsewhere. In my opinion, 
the real reason was that Lyndon Johnson -- with steadily declining support at 
home for our involvement in Vietnam -- couldn't risk sending the reserves 
overseas because they were mostly made up of the sons of middle and upper-class 
Americans whom Johnson didn't care to antagonize. 
</P>
<P>
Our current vice president of the United States was one of those people. For 
all his protestations, the reserves provided a haven for a lot of young men 
with clout to avoid combat. I'm not judging this. I think I would have used any 
device that came to hand to avoid going to Vietnam. I just wish J. Danforth 
Quayle could have been honest about it. 
</P>
<P>
Joining the reserves -- along with graduate studies in college, putting braces 
on teeth and phonied-up physical infirmities -- provided safe houses for those 
who had the necessary resources to avoid Vietnam. The ultimate hypocrites were 
eligible draftees (and their parents) who used such means and then castigated 
those who fled to Canada. That's why I get a little queasiness in the pit of my 
stomach when I hear all this unctuous talk about the reserves of that period 
representing the ultimate in patriotism. The young men without clout who were 
drafted and sent to fight that miserable war were the real heroes. 
</P>
<P>
It's certainly understandable, however, that the failure to activate the 
reserves en masse for combat duty in Vietnam may have had more than a passing 
influence in persuading some of the current reservists to join up. If so, it 
must have come as a bit of a shock when George Bush reached into the reserves 
very quickly in the current Middle East crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The quotes that I've been reading from Orange County reservists in the 
newspaper make it appear that we have a very different crew here. They are 
hardly ecstatic but most have accepted their military responsibilities 
matter-of-factly even though it will mean a considerable dislocation for many 
of them in their civilian lives. Without debating the merit of what Bush is 
doing in the Persian Gulf, this attitude on the part of reservists is healthy 
and the way it should be. 
</P>
<P>
We've come a long way in establishing the identity of the reserves since those 
frenetic months in Korea and those tragic years in Vietnam. Maybe we've hit on 
the right formula now. But let's all hope that the reserves who have been 
called up will all be back at their civilian jobs in a few months. Or sooner.
