Sighting Dollars: "What do you call people who make money off a dead man?" 
asked columnist Elaine Viets caustically in the St. Louis, Mo., Post-Dispatch 
Saturday. Smart, she said. The writer came across a Sherman Oaks company with a 
900 number that's supposed to be a network for Elvis Presley sightings. Viets 
listened to the line for a couple of days. It offered a tape of Elvis songs, 
taped comments from callers with messages for Elvis -- but no sightings. Viets 
tried to reach the company itself, and even they could not be sighted: "all I 
got was their answering service. . . . So what did I get for my $6 call? A 
chance to listen to ads and buy more Elvis things."

splintered from society."
