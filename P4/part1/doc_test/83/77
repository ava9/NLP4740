George Catlett Marshall clearly ranks as one of the most extraordinary soldiers 
and statesmen this nation has ever produced. As World War II Army chief of 
staff he was, in Winston Churchill's words, the great "organizer of victory." 
As secretary of state from 1947-1949 he played a major role in the formulation 
of basic U.S. Cold War policies, most notably Containment and the European 
Recovery Program, which bears his name and led to his receipt of the Nobel 
Peace Prize. As secretary of defense during the Korean War, he helped to 
re-create U.S. military power while simultaneously reasserting civilian control 
over it in the Truman-MacArthur controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall's character was even more impressive than his accomplishments. 
Contemporaries were awed not only by his leadership abilities, but also by his 
honesty, commitment to principle, self-sacrifice, and sense of honor and duty. 
He turned down power, profit, and historical immortality on numerous occasions, 
refusing to seek elected office, to accept lucrative offers for his memoirs, or 
to request command of the Normandy invasion that was his for the asking. Harry 
Truman considered him the "greatest living American." To Churchill, he was "the 
noblest Roman of them all." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agreed. Like any public figure, Marshall had his failures and 
detractors. Pearl Harbor occurred while he was chief of staff, and his 1945-46 
mission to prevent civil war in China did not succeed. His policies infuriated 
the "China Lobby" and the McCarthyites within the Republican Party, who went so 
far as to accuse him of being a "front man for traitors." Yet for most of his 
contemporaries, Marshall remained a figure of towering stature, comparable only 
to George Washington in the annals of U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few decades, however, Marshall's reputation has faded. Most 
college students today cannot identify him at all, save for the fact that he 
had "something to do with the Marshall Plan." As Roosevelt feared, people have 
remembered the battlefield commanders from World War II rather than the 
soldier/statesman who was their mentor and superior. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Cray, journalist, author, and associate professor of journalism at the 
University of Southern California, has attempted to rectify this situation with 
a one-volume biography of Marshall designed for the general reader. He is not 
the first to do so. Three other journalists have previously published popular 
biographies of Marshall: William Frye in 1947, Robert Payne in 1951, and 
Leonard Mosley in 1982. Cray's effort is far superior to all of these. Unlike 
the first two authors, he has the advantage of writing after the publication of 
Forrest C. Pogue's magisterial four-volume official biography and the first two 
volumes of Marshall papers as edited by Larry I. Bland. Unlike the third 
author, he has taken the time (nine years) to immerse himself in this and other 
relevant material, and to verify his conclusions with scholars. His numerous 
sources include unpublished as well as published documents, key secondary 
works, journalistic accounts of the time, oral history transcripts, and his own 
oral history interviews. The result is an accurate and judicious, as well as a 
highly readable portrait of a true American giant. 
</P>
<P>
Cray's title reflects his emphasis. "General of the Army" was a special, 
five-star rank created by Congress to recognize Marshall and a few others for 
exceptional service in World War II. Although he held two Cabinet positions 
afterwards and is most famous today for the Marshall Plan, the focal point of 
his career remains his extraordinary tenure from 1939-1945 as Army chief of 
staff. Cray properly devotes two of his four sections and more than half of his 
narrative, as well as his introductory chapter and title, to this six-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall's basic character and ideas were of course formed long before 1939, 
and Cray's first section clearly traces his personal and professional 
development from birth in 1880 to the chief-of-staff appointment. Those years 
were marked by recognition of his exceptional abilities, but lack of 
appropriate promotion because of the small size of the Army and the fact that 
his genius at staff work prevented him from obtaining troop command. Not until 
1936 would he see his first star. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall's exceptional managerial abilities would be critical in creating the 
largest Army in U.S. history between 1939 and 1945. Of at least equal 
importance in explaining his success during these years, however, was his 
capacity to grow intellectually throughout the war, despite his age, and 
consistently to assume more and more responsibilities. The most important of 
these were political in nature, for war is an instrument of policy and 
inseparable from political realities. Consequently Marshall found himself 
constantly dealing with congressmen, presidents, naval and allied counterparts, 
and leaders of other countries on a host of politico-military issues. So 
successful was he in these efforts that by 1945 he had become the President's 
most trusted adviser and one of the nation's foremost and respected diplomats 
as well as soldiers. His shift after the war from military to 
civilian/diplomatic posts, covered by the author in his fourth and final 
section, was thus far less dramatic and surprising than one would think. 
</P>
<P>
Cray is especially good in explaining the complex politico-military issues of 
the war years while keeping his subject in the foreground. His tightly knit 
narrative weaves together the numerous events that concerned Marshall from 1939 
through 1945 without losing track of the man himself. This is an impressive 
accomplishment for any writer, and especially for one not trained in history. 
</P>
<P>
That lack of training does reveal itself, however, in a few errors and 
omissions. Historians no longer describe the 1920s as an era of "deliberate 
isolationism," for example. On occasion, the author credits Marshall with 
questionable and undocumented beliefs, uses quotes improperly to describe 
preceding events, and provides incorrect first names and background 
information. Although extensive, the bibliography does not include a few 
pivotal works on strategy and diplomacy during World War II and the early Cold 
War, or some previously published studies of Marshall. Compared with other 
popular biographies of major World War II figures, however, this one is 
remarkably accurate and well researched, and highly recommended for the general 
reader.

The Marshall Plan might have rebuilt Eastern Europe 40 years ago, had the 
Soviet Union not stood in the way. See excerpt from "General of the Army,"
