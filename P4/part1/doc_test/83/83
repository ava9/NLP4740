If lucky, the world can usually count on a policeman or two: powers whose 
values and interests predispose them to make sacrifices to uphold rudimentary 
rules of civility. Marauders, bullies, thieves and plunderers ready to abuse 
those rules are never in short supply. In Winston Churchill's vivid image, they 
move constantly through our common household, trying the doors to see whether 
they're locked.

The Korean parallel to the present confrontation with Iraq may yet prove to be 
the right one. It was the first decision of the Cold War period to take up 
arms, as this is the first after it. These decisions to intervene when less 
than national survival is at stake are inevitably shots in the dark, more the 
product of hunch than analysis, uncertain in result. 
</P>
<P>
It is a sober intuition about the balance of power that prompts American 
intervention in the Persian Gulf. Unfortunately, President Bush, who is not a 
man of eloquence, has not explained it very well. But the unprecedented 
unanimity of nations, reflected in the resolutions of the U.N. Security 
Council, shows that far more than "cheap gas" is at issue.

Hussein of Iraq may be no monster of Hitler dimensions. But he is an impressive 
troublemaker who needs to be checked. His recent career shows it. After the 
Shah's fall in Iran, he scrapped a solemn treaty and tried to grab the 
Shatt-al-Arab waterway. That cost the blood of millions. Earlier, he had tried 
to develop a nuclear bomb with which to threaten Israel (and others too, no 
doubt). And but for the boldness of Menachem Begin, who bombed out his nuclear 
plant, he might have succeeded. What powers of blackmail Saddam Hussein would 
now wield if that enterprise had succeeded one can only imagine. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, he tried to import huge "pipeline" segments that were in fact 
the sections of a long-range artillery piece of sinister size. Some neighbor, 
or perhaps the Kurds, would have felt its wrath. In that he was thwarted by 
British customs. ("If it was a pipeline," an informed friend told me in London 
recently, "it was the first rifled pipeline in history.") 
</P>
<P>
Balked in all these adventures, Hussein's new goal was to pillage Kuwait and 
grab control of a substantial part of the world's oil reserves. No doubt it 
would delight him to force Americans to pay more for gas. But that would only 
be the cream on the vast power that oil blackmail would make available. That is 
what such bullies and megalomaniacs seek; and the only deterrent they recognize 
is cold steel. 
</P>
<P>
Playing world policeman gambles with the American public's isolationist 
instincts. But a stitch in time can save nine. When he moved to check North 
Korean aggression in June, 1950, Harry Truman and his advisers assumed, 
incorrectly, that it was orchestrated by Stalin as part of a global strategy. 
Still, timely action then reduced the odds of nuclear war later. 
</P>
<P>
As Gilbert and Sullivan told us, "The policeman's lot is not an 'appy one." It 
is merely necessary.
