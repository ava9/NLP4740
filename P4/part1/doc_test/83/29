Francis Henry Russell, 84, former ambassador and author of the Truman Doctrine. 
Appointed chief of the State Department's Division of World Trade in 1942, 
Russell was named director of the department's public affairs office in 1945. 
Two years later, he helped President Harry S. Truman draft a historic message 
to Congress on aid to Greece and Turkey. In it, Russell wrote the passage on 
the containment of communism now known as the Truman Doctrine. He served as 
charge d' affaires in Israel in 1953 and 1954 and as a special assistant to 
Secretary of State John Foster Dulles from 1955 to 1956. He was named 
ambassador to New Zealand in 1957, serving there for three years before his 
appointment as ambassador to Ghana. He later served as ambassador to Tunisia.
