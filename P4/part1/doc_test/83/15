THIS WEEK'S opinion polls make chilling reading for President George Bush's
hopes for re-election.
The state polls are even more ominous than the national polls and the now
almost daily blasts of disaffection from conservative Republicans.
Mr Bush knows he is behind and is trying to make a virtue of it on his
campaign swing through Texas and California, portraying himself as an
underdog with right and experience on his side. Holidays in Maine have been
cancelled.
But only Harry Truman in 1948 has eliminated a deficit as large as that by
which Mr Bush now trails Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and that
was in the infancy of polling. Gerald Ford nearly did so in 1976 against
Jimmy Carter, but fell two points short.
Moreover, this contest will be determined in the Electoral College, in
which, Maine and Nebraska curiously excepted, the winner of a state gets all
the votes. They key to Republican success in five of the last six elections
has been to lock up large blocs of the country, particularly the south and
most of the west.
This strategy now looks vulnerable. As tabulated by The Hotline, the
invaluable daily political newsletter, the nine latest scattered state
surveys put Mr Clinton ahead everywhere. In only North Dakota and Virginia
do his four- and seven-point respective leads fall within the pollsters'
usual margins of error.
His biggest advantages are in the two largest states; Mr Clinton leads in
California by 62-28 per cent and in New York by 58-28 per cent. Mr Bush is
even behind in Orange County, California, where Democrats are eaten for
breakfast.
The news from important 'swing' states is equally bad. In North Carolina, Mr
Clinton leads by 53-34 per cent, in Missouri by 57-29 per cent, in
Washington by 56-32 per cent and in Minnesota, with a stronger Democratic
tradition, by 60-31 per cent. Even the supposedly solid south-west looks
shaky. In Arizona, for example, Mr Clinton holds a 50-37 per cent edge.
The current polls may overstate Mr Clinton's strength as much as those taken
before the Democratic convention and Mr Ross Perot's withdrawal, showing him
leading in only two of the 50 states, underestimated it, though the race
then was three-way.
At the moment they reflect the desertion to Mr Clinton, not to Mr Bush, of
the Perot volunteer army (by a four-to-one margin in California, for
example) and the perception that the Clinton-Gore campaign is on a real
roll, while the Bush-Quayle team, whose very composition is being
questioned, cannot find the starting gate.
But, for better or worse, polls are the means by which popularity is
measured and which every politician uses to predict elections. For Mr Bush's
more conservative and sometimes reluctant supporters, their message spells
defeat.
Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia this week berated an optimistic Fred
Malek, the Bush campaign strategist, saying he would be 'a foolish person'
to ignore a 62-28 per cent poll result. Congressman Vin Weber of Minnesota,
cracked: 'It is one thing to say there is a hurricane coming, it is another
to see your basement flooding.'
George Will, the columnist, really opened the gates on Wednesday by calling
on the president to withdraw from the race. Since then, Richard Viguerie, a
big conservative fundraiser, has demanded that Mr Bush back out and engineer
a ticket headed by Jack Kemp, the housing secretary, with James Baker, the
secretary of state, as running mate.
Mr Adam Myerson, of the Heritage Foundation, the rightwing think tank,
confessed that 'conservatives do not think a Clinton administration could be
much worse than a Bush administration'. Mr Burton Pines, from the same
stable, added: 'For all the talk of dumping Dan Quayle, we should be talking
about dumping George Bush.'
Mr Tommy Thomas, former Republican party chairman in Florida, paid for a
full-page advertisement (Dollars 45,000) in the Washington Post calling on
Mr Quayle to step down. He later said he wanted Mr Baker to run with Mr
Bush, apparently forgetting that the law prevents both members of a ticket
coming from the same state (though Mr Bush, whose legal residence in Texas
is only a hotel room, could always declare he lived in Maine, while Mr Baker
keeps a home in Wyoming).
One veteran Washington insider, who has worked with Mr Bush over the years,
says the president has the sometimes distressing habit of heeding the advice
of the last person he has spoken to in private. The conservative laments are
public. Only James Baker, apart from Barbara Bush, has the clout and the
access to tell the president what to do.
