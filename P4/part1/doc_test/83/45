At 11.30 this morning, New York time, Bill Clinton will become the 10th US
president to take the rostrum in the UN General Assembly. Like his
predecessors, he will use the occasion to explain his administration's
policies to the world but, even more, his words will be aimed at public
opinion within the US.
The US has made abundant use of the UN as an instrument of its foreign
policy in recent years, and the Clinton administration is committed to the
UN ideologically in a way that its Republican predecessors were not. Yet at
the same time the UN is suffering an acute financial crisis, caused in large
part by the fact that the US is falling further and further behind with its
contributions. For the fiscal year that starts this Friday, the Clinton
administration requested funding based on the UN budget as it stood last
January, since when UN peacekeeping commitments have expanded dramatically.
Congress, however, has cut the appropriation by 5 per cent.
Severely embarrassed by this, the US delegation is hoping today's speech
will mark the start of an intensive lobbying effort to get Congress to take
the UN more seriously. But any such effort will have to be part of a much
broader campaign to explain the connection between the US's foreign policy
commitments and the interests of individual US citizens.
The speech comes as the climax of a series given by Mr Clinton's senior
foreign policy advisers last week, in which they showed themselves well
aware of the need for such a campaign. On Monday the secretary of state,
Warren Christopher, kicked off with a speech devoted mainly to the Middle
East, seeking to exploit the remarkable windfall of an Israeli-Palestinian
peace agreement which had dropped on to the White House lawn a week earlier.
He was followed on Tuesday by Tony Lake, the national security adviser, who
attempted a broader definition of the administration's goals, stressing that
cold war 'containment' of communism had now been replaced by 'enlargement'
of the 'community of market democracies'.
Finally on Thursday Madeleine Albright, ambassador to the UN and a cabinet
member, sought to reassure an audience at the US National War College that
future UN peacekeeping or 'peacemaking' operations would be subject to
strict criteria, and that the president was still prepared to use US forces
unilaterally when necessary 'to protect America and Americans'.
The common thread running through these speeches was an argument on two
fronts. All three speakers showed themselves acutely aware that their most
articulate critics at the moment are not isolationists but foreign policy
specialists, mostly associated with previous Republican administrations.
These people fully accept that the US retains important interests abroad,
but worry that Mr Clinton is jeopardising those interests by subordinating
his freedom of action to multilateral structures, the most important being
Nato and the UN.
Bosnia is at the centre of the argument. Differences over Bosnia have put
Nato under considerable strain, as any European diplomat will tell you. But
not enough strain to satisfy William Safire, the former Nixon speechwriter
turned New York Times columnist, who thinks Mr Clinton should have reminded
Europeans 'that rejection of American leadership on Bosnia has consequences
for Nato'.
The UN comes in for even more stick. Among the factors inhibiting US policy
on Bosnia have been the fear of Russian or Chinese vetoes in the Security
Council, and the presence of UN forces on the ground which are engaged in a
humanitarian mission but unable (or unwilling) to halt military operations
and genocidal 'ethnic cleansing'. The final straw for many commentators came
in early August when the UN secretary-general, Boutros Boutros Ghali,
appeared to claim a right of veto over air strikes which Nato, under strong
US pressure, had at last agreed to threaten.
Such criticisms are echoed by some career diplomats within the state
department, and they have clearly got under the administration's skin. Last
week's speeches were notably defensive about 'multilateralism', and designed
to rebut any accusation of wimpishness. (Ms Albright recalled, for instance,
that in June the president ordered a unilateral attack on Baghdad in
response to Iraq's attempt on the life of his predecessor.) But they were
also a clarion call to all who favour an active foreign policy, seeking to
rally them under the banner of internationalism.
The argument between unilateralists and multilateralists, Mr Lake suggested,
is really a false quarrel, or at most a dispute about tactics. Both sides
agreed that the US had important interests abroad, he said, and in its
defence of them it should be pragmatic about the choice of unilateral or
multilateral instruments. But, he went on, 'there is a more fundamental
foreign policy challenge brewing . . . over whether we will be significantly
engaged abroad at all'.
Mr Clinton likes to compare the present period of international relations
with that which followed 1945, when his Democratic predecessor, Harry S
Truman, responded to an entirely new strategic context by forging a fresh
set of alliances and multilateral institutions under US leadership. To do so
he had to overcome resistance from both Democrats and Republicans who wanted
to keep the US free from peacetime 'entanglements', as it had traditionally
been.
'The internationalists,' recalled Mr Lake, 'won those debates, in part
because they could point to a unitary threat to America's interests and
because the nation was entering a period of economic security. Today's
supporters of engagement abroad have neither of those advantages. The
threats and opportunities are diffuse, and our people are deeply anxious
about their economic fate.'
The irony is, of course, that this public mood was one of the main factors
that brought Mr Clinton to power in the first place. The most widely echoed
criticism of George Bush was that he appeared obsessed with foreign affairs
and neglected the economy, while Mr Clinton's campaign workers constantly
reminded themselves that the issue which mattered was 'the economy, stupid'
 -and the third candidate, Mr Ross Perot, who played a significant role in
Mr Bush's defeat, was even more outspoken in urging that the time had come
for America to put its own interests first.
Mr Clinton himself was never an isolationist. He never suggested that
foreign policy was unimportant, or that the US should abandon its overseas
commitments. Rather his theme was that domestic economic problems now could
and should be given top priority, and that in a complex and interdependent
world foreign policy could no longer be treated as a specialist's topic.
Domestic and foreign, geopolitical and economic issues: all were now
inextricably intertwined, and what was needed was an integrated approach in
which foreign policy would take its place as part of an overall strategy for
guaranteeing the security of present and future generations of Americans.
Put like that, the proposition is hard to dispute, and Mr Clinton the
'policy wonk', with his formidable grasp of detail across a broad range of
issues, was well placed to put this approach into practice. He is described,
by a foreign ambassador who has been able to observe him at close quarters,
as 'one of the most intelligent current political leaders' on the world
stage; and he has brought with him into government a formidable array of
intellectuals who have been honing their brains and refining their ideas in
think-tanks and universities during the long years of opposition.
The effort to rethink issues and produce coherent strategies for new
situations is real, and impressive. Great trouble has been taken to
co-ordinate the thinking and activities of different departments, and the
turf battles which produced so much incoherence in both the Carter and
Reagan administrations (less so under Mr Bush) have up to now been largely
avoided.
Mr Gordon Adams, for instance, at the Office of Management and Budget, makes
no distinction between the budgets for defence, energy, peacekeeping (which
comes under the state department), or the Agency for International
Development. To him this is all money spent on security.
The 'bottom-up review' of US defence needs, published by defence secretary
Les Aspin on September 1, is generally regarded as rather conservative but
is also given credit for being intellectually honest - 'as our defence
reviews never are', in the words of one rueful British observer. That is to
say, it is genuinely 'bottom-up', in the sense that it first defines the
tasks and then argues from them to the force levels required, rather than
being designed to justify a particular level of expenditure. Whether the
money to sustain those force levels will actually be found, especially when
the full costs of the proposed healthcare reform are recognised, is another
matter, on which Mr Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House foreign affairs
committee, has serious doubts.
What no one disputes is that this is a serious administration which takes
foreign policy seriously. A comment heard repeatedly in Washington earlier
this month was that it performs well when working to a deadline. It set
itself to produce a package of aid for reform in Russia before the
Clinton-Yeltsin summit in April; to articulate a China policy before June 3,
when China's most favoured nation status had to be renewed by Congress; to
produce a broader Asian policy; and a negotiating strategy for the Uruguay
Round, before the Tokyo summit.
It has now got its act together on the North American Free Trade Agreement -
although many fear this will prove to be too late, since Mr Perot and the
labour unions have achieved such a grip on public opinion in the meantime.
And the hope is that by January 10, when Mr Clinton comes to Europe for a
Nato summit convened by himself, it will also have produced a clear
blueprint for the future of the Atlantic alliance.
This poses a real dilemma. It is widely argued in Washington that Nato will
lose its relevance unless it is seen to extend security eastwards into
central Europe; yet many fear that to enlarge Nato's membership would mean
giving unfulfillable guarantees to unstable new democracies, and in the
process offer a propaganda boon to paranoid anti-western forces in Russia.
One senior administration official admitted to me, however, that 'what
really matters is Bosnia'. If by January 10 Nato was 'there, and doing
something', the summit would be a success. But if 'Sarajevo has gone down
the tubes', it would be a failure. No doubt it will depend on some other
unforeseeable events, too, such as the outcome of the power struggle in
Russia. The weakness of the administration's 'think-tank' approach to
policy-making is, precisely, that it does not facilitate quick or decisive
reactions to uexpected events. A problem like Bosnia, and perhaps still less
Russia, cannot be relied on to sit still while six committees of brilliant
political scientists hammer out a policy statement, writing incisive minutes
in the margins of each other's drafts; or while the president conducts a
thoughtful and well-informed debate with himself in the presence of his
advisers, or sometimes of astonished journalists.
Mr Clinton is devoting a great deal of his time to foreign policy - more
than he likes to admit. The week before last, for instance, he telephoned
almost every EC head of government to urge on them the importance of
preserving the Blair House agreement on agriculture if the Uruguay Round was
not to be scuppered. He is as aware as anyone that America's economic
interests and national security are closely tied to the maintenance of an
open trading system and a free and orderly world.
But, as Mr Lake recognised, it is much harder for him to persuade the
American public that this requires a big investment of American resources
than it was for Harry Truman to do the same at the start of the cold war. In
today's speech Mr Clinton has to find a way of making the point without
seeming to betray his campaign promise to put domestic affairs first.
