Leaders of the California thoroughbred racing fraternity opened the fall season 
at Santa Anita this week in the Directors Room with a lavish luncheon prepared 
by executive chef Tony Pope. 
</P>
<P>
Clement L. Hirsch who conceived the idea for Oak Tree -- begun in 1969 as a 
non-dividend paying association to foster research, care and breeding of 
thoroughbreds -- officially began his 22nd season as Oak Tree president. His 
wife Lynn, Los Angeles and Orange County civic leader, was by his side. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the crowd was the newest member of the board, Sherwood C. Chillingworth 
of Pasadena and his wife, Sandra. He's the first addition to the board since 
the deaths of founding directors Harold C. Ramser Sr. and Louis R. Rowan, more 
than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
At their table, the Hirsches hosted the chief executives of the two most 
successful race tracks (parimutuel-wise) in the country -- Joseph W. Harper, 
president and general manager of Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, and Robert P. 
Strub, chairman and CEO of Los Angeles Turf Club, and their wives, Barbara 
Harper and and Betty Strub. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling from San Diego for the affair were John and Betty Mabee. Mabee 
campaigns one of the ranking 2-year-olds in the nation, Best Pal, winner of the 
$344,100 Del Mar Futurity, in his Golden Eagle Farm colors. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the crowd were Georgia Ridder, Dr. Jack and Maggie Robbins, Anabeth and 
John J. Elmore Jr. of Newport Beach, Diane and Harry Rinker of Santa Ana, Betty 
Ramser with Hal and Amalia Ramser, and Oscar and Alice Lawler. 
</P>

ROYAL: Dudley Moore entertains and Roger Moore hosts when the British Academy 
of Film and Television Arts hosts a royal gala evening to honor Michael Caine 
in the presence of Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra -- she is the daughter 
of the duke and duchess of Kent and Queen Elizabeth II's first cousin -- on 
Friday at the Westin South Coast Plaza Hotel in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
It's a three-way split for proceeds: Childhelp USA, Children's Home Society and 
the academy's Los Angeles chapter. According to chapter president Marion 
Rosenberg, absolutely no cameras will be allowed into the banquet because of 
restrictions by the British Consulate and royal protocol. 
</P>
<P>
Princess Alexandra is here for the South Coast Plaza Festival of Britain and 
the opening of the British and the Oscar Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
BLACK-TIE: As the new chairman of the board of trustees of Harvey Mudd College 
and to bond the trustees for the challenges that lie ahead, Clifford A. Miller, 
with his wife Judith, hosted trustees and spouses at a dinner-dance Upstairs at 
the Bistro. 
</P>
<P>
The evening also was a tribute to retiring chairman, E. H. (Hubie) Clark, who 
will remain a trustee. Among guests were Norman and Erlenne Sprague, Richard 
and Marjorie Stegemeier, the college president Henry Riggs and his wife Gayle, 
Patricia Clark, Alexander and Adelaide Hixon and Robert Hastings and his 
frequent date Phyllis Diller. More there -- Michael Morphy with Allegra Clark, 
Trude and Joan Taylor, Jim Kilroy, Robert and Louisa Miller, Marian Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
BLACK-SHOE: Invitations arrived in a black tap shoe when the Dance Gallery 
Guild hosted its "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" opening evening. Co-chairwomen 
Patti Amstutz and Ruth Moss arranged the champagne supper after the 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
SUCCESSES: More than 500 celebrities and supporters turned out for the 
fund-raising brunch for the Rape Foundation hosted by the cast of the TV 
series, "China Beach." 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. Law" stars Susan Dey and Corbin Bernsen and actress Kelly McGillis were 
among those honored for the center's documentary film for college students, 
"Campus Rape." The center has distributed the film to more than half the U. S. 
universities, according to Gail Abarbanel, center director. 
</P>
<P>
The brunch was at Greenacres, Ted and Susie Field's estate. Hosted by 
Emmy-winning actresses Dana Delany and Marg Helgenberger and other "China 
Beach" cast members, the event garnered about $200,000. Giving support were 
Veronica Hamel, Jaclyn Smith, David Niven Jr., Norman and Lyn Lear, Sherry 
Lansing, Heather Thomas, Judith Light and Linda and Bob Gersch. 
</P>
<P>
BIG NIGHT: Santa Marta Hospital Foundation's Oct. 24 ball at the Beverly 
Wilshire will support the only Latino-owned and operated hospital in the United 
States. Because of its work with the poor in East Los Angeles, the hospital is 
attracting the attention of prominent Angelenos. 
</P>
<P>
To be feted that night are Sister Marie Madeleine of Saint John's Hospital and 
Health Center, Reva and William Tooley and Santa Marta's hospital medical

EXTRA TREATS: Platinum Circle guests at the third annual Frank Sinatra 
Celebrity Invitational golf tournament in Palm Desert Feb. 21-23 will have the 
extra treat of attending a post-gala at the Sinatra Rancho Mirage home. 
</P>
<P>
Ol' Blue Eyes headlines the gala and can be counted on for a few nightcap songs 
at the party. 
</P>
<P>
Platinum Circle reservations are a mere $10,000, but it's for a superb cause -- 
the Desert Hospital and the Barbara Sinatra Children's Center at Eisenhower 
Medical Center at Rancho Mirage . . . . 
</P>
<P>
And, speaking of treats, Halloween looms. The Los Angeles Children's Museum's 
premiere group, The Inner Circle, hosts its annual Halloween Fashion Show and 
Luncheon next Sunday at the Beverly Hilton. Saks Fifth Avenue will garb the 
ladies on the ramp -- including honoree Jaclyn Smith, Inner Circle's president 
Carol Walker and executive vice president Esther Rosenfield. The children of 
stars will be in hot costumes from "Costumes for Kids" on Melrose Avenue. 
</P>
