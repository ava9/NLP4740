HOT PROPERTY: A BIT OF ENGLAND IN BEL-AIR FOR ACTRESS SEYMOUR 
</P>

Actress Jane Seymour and her business manager-husband, David Flynn, have sold 
the house in the Beverly Hills Post Office area that they bought a year ago in 
March from singer Carol Lawrence and are about to start renovating a Bel-Air 
house that they purchased earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"They keep buying homes to fix up and live in, but the (Carol Lawrence) house 
wound up being too big for spending some weekends and other days when they're 
in town," said Jana Jones of Alvarez, Hyland &amp; Young. 
</P>
<P>
The Flynns' main U.S. residence is in Santa Barbara, and they also own a couple 
of homes in England, including one in the Mayfair district of London, which 
they just purchased. 
</P>
<P>
"They plan to spend more time in England," Jones said. But the English-born 
actress, whose credits include a starring role in the TV miniseries "War and 
Remembrance," and her American husband will have a touch of England in Los 
Angeles, because they expect to turn their traditional-style Bel-Air house into 
a Country English home, designed by architect Gus Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
The couple also plan to expand the Bel-Air house, which they purchased for 
slightly more than $1.2 million, from 3,500 to about 6,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Flynns turned the 6,980-square-foot French Regency they bought from 
Lawrence for $2.25 million, into an 8,000-square-foot Georgian Colonial, also 
designed by Duffy, with red-brick exteriors and white pillars. 
</P>
<P>
The Georgian Colonial, which has seven bedrooms and six baths, was sold before 
it was listed and landscaping was completed. "The buyers climbed over the dirt 
to look at it," Jones remarked. 
</P>
<P>
It sold, Jones said, for $6 million, a price that a broker from another Beverly 
Hills firm termed "amazing for the area," despite the site's views from 
downtown to the ocean. Jones credits Flynn, whom she describes as "the man with 
the vision." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody else would touch that property because it had a gully," she said, "but 
he had the foresight to buy it, fill the gully with dirt and put in a retaining 
wall to create a flat place where a tennis court was built. Because he did 
that, he got the price he did." 
</P>
<P>
The buyer is Theodore J. Forstmann, general partner of Forstmann, Little &amp; 
Co., a New York investment firm formed in 1978 to specialize in leveraged 
buyouts. The home is Forstmann's first in California, other sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Victoria Principal has listed her Benedict Canyon home at $1.15 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The 3,000-square-foot house, which has three bedrooms and an office that 
Principal used as a gym, is on the market through Rory Barish of June Scott 
&amp; Associates, Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The gated home is where Principal and her husband, Dr. Harry Glassman, were 
living last August when they bought a larger house in Beverly Hills for $2.95 
million. 
</P>
<P>
It has taken them this long to move into that home, which was built in the 
1940s, because they have been doing major remodeling on it, other sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The Benedict Canyon home, built in 1966, was Principal's main residence even 
before she and Glassman were married about eight years ago, Barish said. "She 
lived there for 12 years," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Bentley, widow of the founder of Bentley Laboratories in Newport Beach, 
has put her Pebble Beach retreat on the market at $9.5 million. Her main 
residence is on Lido Island. 
</P>
<P>
She and her late husband, Donald James Bentley, bought the 2.67-acre Pebble 
Beach property, with 515 feet of ocean frontage on the 17 Mile Drive, in 1984. 
The two-story contemporary that they built there has seven bedrooms and seven 
baths in about 8,000 square feet, behind 10-foot-tall iron gates. 
</P>
<P>
"They left a couple of walls from the original house but rebuilt the rest and 
just finished it when he died (in April, 1986)," said Mary Sivaslian of Marion 
Buie Realty, Newport Beach, who shares the listing with Deirdre Reade of Fox 
&amp; Carskadon, Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
Bentley invented the first disposable oxygenator, used in heart surgery, before 
he sold his company in 1981 to American Hospital Supply Corp. of Chicago for 
$243 million. Later, Bentley Labs was sold to Baxter Labs, also of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Liberace's first Palm Springs home has been leased with an option to buy, said 
Larry Seaward, who put the three-bedroom, 2,800-square-foot house, with a 
piano-shaped pool and a mural depicting the late entertainer and his friends, 
on the market in February at $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The house was built (in 1958) for (actress) Mae West, but she didn't buy it," 
Seward said. "The people who have leased it, as a vacation home, are Margo and 
Rod West." He's an ABC-TV exec, and they live in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Annabelle Heiferman, who was the mayor of Beverly Hills during the mid-1980s, 
and her husband, Joe, a retired costume jeweler, are now calling Fairbanks 
Ranch home. 
</P>
<P>
The Heifermans bought a New England-style house with a swimming pool and a 
large, enclosed patio in the Rancho Santa Fe community for $1.6 million in 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
Fairbanks Ranch, a 2,000-acre development, is now into its second decade. 
Ground was broken in 1980. "The first lot was sold to an old-line Los Angeles 
family," said a spokeswoman for the project, "and the last lot was recently 
sold to an international executive from overseas." 
</P>
<P>
Lots were initially advertised for as low as $175,000; today, lot resales 
average $600,000 to several million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
John McCristy of Rancho Santa Fe Acreage &amp; Homes represented the 
Heifermans, and Gary Driver Jr. of Fairbanks Ranch Realty had the listing.
