FT  27 MAR 93 / Arts: A nude man within reach - Screen

EVERY MARCH, a group of famous women compete for the chance to hold a nude
man in their hands while the world's TV audiences look on. The women are
called film stars; the nude man is called Oscar; and leading the field for
this year's Best Actress contest, on Monday, are the America's Susan
Sarandon and Britain's Emma Thompson.
Let me declare a conflict of interest. Although the Briton in me wants
Thompson to win the statuette for giving the cinema of EM Forster a full
eight-pint blood transfusion, the internationalist in me says something
else: that Susan Sarandon, nominated for Lorenzo's Oil, has spent 20 years
giving even more blood to even more critical stretcher-cases and is overdue
for accolade.
Sarandon's down-home passion as an actress - the low elastic voice, the
pretty-plain features, the hooded eyes that range from half-mast slyness to
full Bette Davis pop-open effect - has raised a dozen films from the dead:
King Of The Gypsies, The Other Side Of Midnight, The Hunger, Uncompromising
Positions . . .
As a reward, Hollywood occasionally throws her a major movie. Atlantic City,
Pretty Baby, Bull Durham or Thelma And Louise which earned Sarandon her last
year's Best Actress Oscar nomination. If she wins this year's, for a film in
which she power-acts everyone off the screen including co-star Nick Nolte,
Sarandon will no doubt get up on the stage and play the appropriate role:
the speechifying, gushing, jewel-bedecked Movie Star. 'I would like to thank
. . .'
But when I met her, filming on location in New York, I discovered something
rarer than the Roc bird. A film actress who tells you what she actually
thinks about the film industry. About the roles it provides for women (and
men); about stage versus screen acting; about how films are born in the age
of high-concept marketing; and about the difficulty - impossibility? - of
being both an actress and a movie star.
Sarandon On Casting And Typecasting. In my career I've been 'discovered'
about four times. 'She's good at playing waitresses,' they say after Thelma
And Louise, so I get offered a row of waitresses] 'She's good at
prostitutes' after Pretty Baby, so every script I'm sent is set in a
brothel. I don't know what they consider a Susan Sarandon role to be. (Wry
laughter).
Sarandon On Anti-Agents And Asking-Fees. When it comes to my choosing roles,
my agents are kind of anti-agents. They never advise me along the company
line. For films like Bull Durham or Light Sleeper I'll take half my asking
price. Because you know that as soon as you get an offer for Dollars 2 1/2 m
with a script that it's going to be horrible. If you don't do the parts you
want to do, you're a prisoner of your own celebrity. We still get paid
obscene amounts of money (laugh and emotive grimace) to do a pretty
ridiculous job. So you keep your living standard lower to get a higher range
of interesting work.
Sarandon On Roles For Women. Thelma And Louise was a breakthrough, but I
don't think it resulted in any consciousness-raising about female roles in
Hollywood. I don't believe there are that many good parts for men either.
It's just that even with bad parts in uninteresting films the focus is on
the man's problems. The women are there in a shallow or caricatured role as
the emotional support. I still don't see that changing.
Sarandon On Film-Making In And Outside Hollywood. Most big-studio projects
today are put together from the poster working backwards. The advertising
concept takes over the movie and the director, scriptwriter, actors all have
to fit in. If you film in LA itself, it can feel very regimented, like a 9
to 5 job. The studios have their rules, the unions too. That's why I love
working on location. Everybody scrambles and helps each other out, the job
definitions are less so strict. Hollywood has become a factory town with all
that follows from that, and I think that's why you don't hear people talking
about pictures there, it's always 'product.'
Sarandon On Acting For Screen And Stage. The difference between theatre and
film, I've always thought, is like that between making love and
masturbation. In theatre you know you're reaching someone - the audience;
and what they give back is taken and changed by you into something that fits
the context of the play. Film acting is very much a self-centred, detached
form of concentration. You have to make individual moments work and hope
whoever puts it together has the same idea you do as to how it fits.
But it's like doing a jigsaw in the dark. In the last scene in Bull Durham,
when Kevin (Costner) comes back to me and we're sitting on the swing and
it's kind of emotional, for that scene we had to keep stopping all day for
the sun, and then go off to shoot bits of a totally different scene in the
rain, then come back to the swing again .. So the director suggested
something that I think was inspired. We played music, so we could find our
way back each time to the same song that had a kind of emotional fertility
for both of us.
It can be maddening to keep stopping and starting all the time. You can
never know if the scene is working as a flow. But I guess that's what's
addictive about movie acting. You're never sure if you're getting it right,
so you keep going back to try again.
