</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tamara De Treaux, 31-inch tall actress who shared the role of "E.T." in the 
famous Stephen Spielberg movie, has died. She was 31. 
</P>
<P>
Miss De Treaux died Wednesday at Medical Center of North Hollywood of 
respiratory problems and heart failure, her long-time friend, Ken Maley, said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Starting out in small theaters in San Francisco, Miss De Treaux joined the 
backup singing group called The Medflies in 1980. The group performed in San 
Francisco's Boarding House and Los Angeles' Comedy Store and Roxie. 
</P>
<P>
Spotted by Spielbeg's staff at the Roxie, she was hired to perform as the 
extraterrestrial creature after the original actor was injured. Although 
Spielberg had urged silence about who was or was not inside the special effects 
of E.T., Miss De Treaux publicly stated that she had played the lovable ugly 
little character in scenes that required movement, while a mechanical E.T. was 
used in closeups. 
</P>
<P>
Miss De Treaux also starred in the film "Ghoulies" as the character Greedigut, 
and "Rockula" as the character Bat Dork. She had recently completed work in 
"Love in Venice" due for release this month, and in "The Linguine Incident." 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by her mother, Barbara Detro, and a brother and a sister. 
</P>
<P>
Services are scheduled Tuesday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in North Hollywood.
