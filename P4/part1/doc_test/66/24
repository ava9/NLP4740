FT  27 SEP 93 / Arts: Two houses clash their swords - Opera in Paris

While musical life in London is taken up with the battle of the orchestras,
Parisians are in the fortunate position of being able to watch the rivalry
between two international opera-houses. An extra frisson is added when one
knows that political rivalry lurks in the background.
The Bastille (or, to give it its full name, the Opera de Paris Bastille) is
the vast new opera-house of the people, a state organisation, the treasured
project of Mitterrand and the left. Even at the opening night of the season,
jeans are de rigeur. The Theatre du Chatelet has a smarter audience than the
old Palais Garnier and is, if not snobbish, at least elegant. It belongs to
the city, the homeground of Chirac and the right.
Surely it cannot be a coincidence that they chose to open their 1993-94
seasons on consecutive nights, both mounting new productions, both turning
to the most ambitious large-scale German operas? The clash of swords can
almost be heard from behind the drop-curtain.
The Bastille came first. Its new production of Wagner's Der fliegende
Hollander was entrusted to the film producer Werner Herzog, who has already
essayed Wagner (without great success) at Bayreuth. He updated the opera to
the early years of the industrial revolution. Senta and her workmates have
dispensed with their spinning-wheels and operate a large textile machine.
Daland's men are first seen trying to haul their capsized steamship out of
the water - memories of Herzog's film, Fitzcarraldo.
The programme reminded us that Wagner was inspired to take up the myth of
the flying Dutchman after a perilous journey by sea to England, during which
storms forced the boat to take refuge off the coast of Norway. Herzog has
seized upon this image and set the opera in a frozen wasteland. An iceberg
looms over the scene; when the time comes for the arrival of the Dutchman's
ship, it rises out of the sea to a vast height and disgorges the wandering
mariner.
That is the limit to the production's entertainment value. Nothing that
follows suggests that Herzog has any point to make out of his choice of time
or place. Maurizio Balo's settings are impressive (so they should be on the
most lavishly equipped opera-stage in the world) but the characters could be
anybody, at any time, anywhere.
Somewhere along the line the Bastille had lost its scheduled baritone. Simon
Estes, a much-travelled Dutchman, took over, singing strongly, but not
making much either of the words or the personality. During the long duet
with Senta he hit an awkward patch where he seemed fated to arrive in tune
only one line in every seven. Sabine Hass's Senta was a cuddly figure, not
much given to obsessions or neuroses, who revealed most about herself when
she was punching out big, blazing top notes.
Nothing that passed between them was of any moment, although I hesitate to
blame the singers for that, as the same vacuum enveloped Aage Haugland's
booming Daland and Peter Straka's Erik. Myung-Whun Chung and the Bastille
orchestra received a roar of applause, which would be hard to justify. It
seemed to me that the performance needed a stiff dose of discipline to stop
it losing impetus and getting becalmed for long stretches at a time.
The next night at the Theatre du Chatelet - another coincidence. The
Chatelet's new production of Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier was also set in the
period of the opera's composition. Adolf Dresen, the producer, had done away
with Rococo finery and set the piece in the years just before the First
World War.
If penny-pinching was the objective, he could hardly have done the company a
better favour. No need for all that gilt decor, brocaded upholstery and
sumptuous costumes. The Marschallin's bedroom consisted of merely a bed and
a grandfather clock (she must have a clock of some kind, if she is to stop
the time in the middle of the night). The Baron's seduction supper was held
outdoors in the backyard of the local Heuriege, not a plausible locale.
Visually it was a big disappointment, but Dresen scored by making his
characters really seem to live in that period.
It is unlikely that Felicity Lott will ever look more at home as the
Marschallin than she did here. With her willowy stance, sinuous arms,
elegantly casual walk, she is the picture of a society lady in the
20th-century understanding of the term. Morals had changed somewhat by 1910
and one imagines that she would easily forget this affair with a shrug of
her shoulders (oh, those shoulders] Are there any in opera today which work
harder?) The voice is only just weighty enough, even in this theatre, but
she floated the opening of the trio to graceful perfection.
Every comment, every look that passed between her and Randi Stene's
tousle-haired Octavian, as their relationship broke down, was heartrending.
No Octavian that I have seen has looked younger, more vulnerable than Stene,
an impressively confident young mezzo, and the sense of pain was akin to
needles piercing innocent young flesh. Cyndia Sieden was a delightfully
open, uninhibited Sophie. Kurt Rydl convincingly turned Baron Ochs into a
sharp-witted dealer in dapper suit and panama hat, quick to pocket the
croissant left on the Marschallin's breakfast table.
After his lacklustre showing at the Aix-en-Provence festival in the summer
Armin Jordan was a conductor transformed, keeping Strauss's music thrusting
forwards without slackening or sentimentality. He was fortunate to have the
Philharmonia Orchestra from London (sponsored by Rover France) on good form
in the pit. Why ever should this orchestra be facing the threat of closure
when it is proving such a high-profile ambassador for British music abroad?
The French must think us mad. Ironic to find the battles of British musical
politics being fought in Paris as well.
