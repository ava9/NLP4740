de Grenoble

Official speeches are generally greeted with polite applause, but Edouard
Balladur, the French prime minister, was treated to a really rousing
response to the address he delivered to mark the opening earlier this year
of the glittering new Musee de Grenoble.
As the local officials had hoped, Mr Balladur had used the occasion to
promise that the government, which had paid roughly half the FFr210m cost of
building the new museum, would make a similar contribution to Grenoble's
next artistic project, the FFr200m renovation programme for the Maison de la
Culture, the city's arts centre which was built in 1968.
There is a political logic to Mr Balladur's decision. The new Musee de
Grenoble was conceived in the early 1980s, when both the city council and
the French government were under socialist control, as part of the Grands
Projets, the modern architectural programme initiated by President Francois
Mitterrand to mark the bicentennial of the French Revolution and - or so say
his critics - his own regime.
The new museum has all the hallmarks of the Grands Projets. It is a
spectacular piece of contemporary architecture in a stunning setting beside
the River Isere. The white cubist building is uncompromisingly modern but
makes the most of its location; its white walls lead up to glazed roofs
which offer glimpses of the snow-capped mountains all around the city.
It houses one of the best art collections in France. This dates back to 1796
when the Musee de Grenoble was first created to house the paintings and
sculpture seized from local aristocrats in the 1789 French Revolution. The
city has added to the collection ever since, both by acquisition and by
donations from the state.
The new museum shows off the collection to perfection, beginning with 23
rooms devoted to pre-1900 art, from 13th century Italian Renaissance pieces
to post-Impressionist paintings by Paul Gauguin. Another 40 rooms display
one of Europe's most comprehensive collections of 20th century art.
The new building will allow Serge Lemoine, its chief curator, to stage more
temporary exhibitions - and enable the Musee de Grenoble to make the most of
proposals to distribute part of the national modern art collection, now
housed at Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, to other museums. This was one
of the last Grands Projets to be built. The Mitterrand era is now nearing
its end and the centre-right Balladur government has adopted a different
approach to the arts from the socialists, with a new policy focusing on
conservation.
Jacques Toubon, the new arts minister, has launched an ambitious programme
of renovating France's old buildings - more in keeping with the conservative
rhetoric of his cabinet colleagues than the socialists' zest for innovation.
He has already announced plans to restore a number of buildings in Paris,
including the Georges Pompidou arts centre and Garnier opera house.
Renovation of the Maison de la Culture in Grenoble is an ideal addition,
particularly as it was the showpiece of the policy pursued by a past
centre-right French government: the arts centre programme initiated in the
late 1960s by Andre Malraux, the writer who became arts minister under
General de Gaulle.
