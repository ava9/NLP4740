<P>
Two weeks before the French stormed the Bastille on July 14, 1789, and launched 
their political revolution, "La Fille mal gardee" began a revolution of its own 
in the ballet world. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, ballets often had been mere strings of formal dances hung upon a 
plot line, usually about gods and goddesses in disguise or make-believe 
shepherds and shepherdesses. 
</P>
<P>
But with "Fille" (The Badly Guarded Daughter), ballet began to tell a definite 
story, with every dance flowing directly out of a situation and advancing the 
plot. And the characters became real people, farmers and peasants. Well, 
reasonably real people. 
</P>
<P>
The plot concerns the efforts of the lovers, Lise and Colas, to thwart the 
efforts of Lise's mother (Widow Simone) to marry her off to someone she doesn't 
love. The ballet combines comedy, pantomime, farce, as well as lyrical and 
virtuoso dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Choreographer Jean Dauberval apparently found inspiration for his ballet in a 
colored print he saw one day in a shop window, of a youth fleeing from a 
cottage, an angry old woman throwing his hat after him and a peasant girl 
crying. 
</P>
<P>
(Such a print was actually found a century later in the Paris National Library 
by the British ballet historian and critic Cyril Beaumont.) 
</P>
<P>
The Dauberval version -- which premiered under a different title -- was 
originally danced to popular French folk songs and tunes. But when the ballet 
arrived at the Paris Opera in 1828, a new score for it was composed by 
Ferdinand Herold. Unencumbered by copyright laws, incidentally, Herold lifted 
themes from Rossini's "La Cenerentola" and "Il barbiere di Siviglia," but also 
wrote much delightful music of his own. 
</P>
<P>
When the ballet made it to Berlin in 1864, composer Peter Ludwig Hertel created 
yet another new score. But it is Herold's music, in various arrangements and 
orchestrations, that is usually heard today. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ballet is the oldest in the current repertory, virtually nothing 
survives of Dauberval's original choreography. Later versions have been created 
by Petipa and Ivanov (the "Swan Lake" team), Mikhail Mordkin, Bronislava 
Nijinska and others. 
</P>
<P>
British choreographer Frederick Ashton created his version for the Royal Ballet 
in 1960, and it was this version that was danced by the Joffrey Ballet at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
One of the constants throughout, however, remains a tradition of a man dancing 
the role of Widow Simone en travesti. 
</P>
<P>
Ballet Pacifica will dance choreography by founding director Lila Zali, after 
the version by Russian dancer and choreographer Mikhail Mordkin. 
</P>
<P>
Zali was in the New York-based Mordkin Ballet from 1938 until it became the 
nucleus of American Ballet Theatre in 1940. (She later joined the Colonel de 
Basil Ballet Russe, which disbanded in 1946.) 
</P>
<P>
"I was very young, and danced primarily in the corps de ballet," Zali said in a 
recent phone interview. "But you watched everything that went on." 
</P>
<P>
Ballet Pacifica has been dancing the work since 1969, according to Zali. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very challenging technically for the girl (Lise), and also in terms of 
the acting, of course. Being a comedy, there has to be a lot of acting." 
</P>
<P>
But financial concerns will rule out the traditional clog dance for Widow 
Simone, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not been able to find any kind of clogs you can really dance in," Zali 
said. "He wears clogs, but takes them off to dance. To dance in, they have to 
be specially made and cost a fortune." 
</P>
<P>
