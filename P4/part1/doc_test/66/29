Mr Myung Wung Chung, the Korean conductor who is fighting his dismissal as
artistic director of Opera de Paris, yesterday was physically barred from
entering the Bastille opera house by Mr Jean-Paul Cluzel, the director.
Opera de Paris fired Mr Chung two weeks ago after fruitless negotiations
over his contract. However, Mr Chung won an important battle in his legal
campaign against his dismissal on Monday when a Paris judge ruled that he
should be reinstated until his case had been heard. The judge also ruled
that Opera de Paris would not be allowed to appoint other conductors for
productions originally to be directed by Mr Chung. The Opera de Paris
management refused to reinstate Mr Chung and to admit him when he arrived at
the Bastille yesterday for a rehearsal of Verdi's Simon Boccanegra, which is
due to open the Bastille's autumn season on September 19. Members of the
orchestra said they would strike in protest if Simon Boccanegra went ahead
without Mr Chung.
