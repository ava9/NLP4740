Henri Temianka's California Chamber Virtuosi series at Pepperdine University, 
Malibu, ended its latest season Saturday night with adept musicianship and 
programming. The concert offered three substantial French pieces from the late 
Romantic era in celebration of the bicentennial of the French Revolution.

Surrounded by the red, white and blue flags of both the United States and 
France, Temianka announced the program from the stage, giving lengthy 
descriptions of Paris and the close circle of composers there. His sweeping 
opinions sometimes startled. Less often, spurious information tended to detract 
from Temianka's charm, which otherwise helped to hold the audience's interest.

Violinist Sergiu Schwartz and pianist Steven Gayer highlighted the evening with 
a mesmerizing performance of Cesar Franck's Violin Sonata. Phrases were 
carefully wrought and delivered with delicacy and warmth. 
</P>
<P>
In Franck's Piano Quintet, Michael Markman, violin; Donald McInnes, viola, and 
Timothy Landauer, cello, joined Schwartz and Mayer in a deft performance that 
romped fittingly. An equally fine performance of Debussy's Violin Sonata 
completed the program. GREGG WAGER
