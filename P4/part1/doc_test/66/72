glory - A guide to the diverse districts of Paris

THE city of Paris is in the shape of a circle, bordered by the ancient
portes, the old city gates, and the modern mayhem of the peripherique
ringroad. The centre (see map overleaf) is divided into 20 arrondissements
spiralling clockwise from the Ile de la Cite, the historic heart of Paris.
Paris has been restored to its old glory in the Mitterrand era. The statues
were regilded for the bi-centennial celebrations in 1989 and the old
sandstone buildings renovated in the late 1980s property boom. In the
meantime two brand new business districts have been built - the tall towers
of La Defense to the west and the brutal blocks of Bercy to the east.
1. OPERA. Garnier's grandiose Opera is at the heart of the old banking
district. The big French banks, Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de
Paris, still tower over the financial sector from their opulent buildings on
boulevard des Italiens. But some of the smaller banks and insurers have been
chased away by high rents and cramped conditions to find more modern
accommodation in other parts of Paris.
Societe Generale is now following suit by trading in its historic
headquarters for a brand new tower block at La Defense.
2. PALAIS-ROYAL. This was built by the wily Cardinal Richelieu in the 17th
century but made its name as the centre of the Paris red light district in
the 18th and 19th centuries when its picturesque arcades were filled with
gambling dens and whore houses.
Palais-Royal today, with the Louvre museum on one side and the Banque de
France and Bibliotheque Nationale on the other, is the home of Jack Lang's
arts ministry, its beautifully restored gardens (courtesy of the LVMH luxury
goods group) and Daniel Buren's controversial sculpture, built on the
ministry's old parking lot.
3. THE MARAIS. This is one of the few parts of Paris to have emerged
unscathed from Baron Haussmann's 19th century reconstruction schemes. The
old 17th century hotels, once the homes of the aristocracy and their
concubines, survived to be renovated by young professional Parisians in the
1980s.
Although the Marais, with its narrow alleys and the arcaded place des
Vosges, is still a lovely area to stroll around. It is also the home of
Musee Picasso, the fruit of the Picasso family's tax deal with the French
government, and some of the city's best contemporary art galleries.
4. SAINT-GERMAIN. This area today does not evoke quite the same esprit as
that of Balzac's novels, but its 18th century town houses are still among
the loveliest in Paris. Saint-Germain is squeezed between the snobby
septieme, the seventh arrondissement, where many of the government
ministries are based, and the studenty sixth. It houses a number of Paris'
most fashionable shopping areas, art galleries and antique dealers, as well
as the tiny Musee Delacroix and Eglise Saint-Germain, famous for its choral
concerts.
5. CHAMPS-ELYSEES. This is the Parisian answer to London's Oxford Street and
New York's Fifth Avenue, with its parade of shops and cinemas. Jacques
Chirac, the city's mayor, is doing his best to spruce it up by imposing
strict rules and regulations over what the tenants can and can not do with
their premises.
Meanwhile the new generation of Champs-Elysees tenants, led by the space-age
Virgin Megastore, is revitalising the area. The chic shopping streets
running off it, notably Avenue Montaigne, have also been revitalised thanks
to the opening of new shops and restaurants.
6. LA DEFENSE is the joint initiative between the French government and the
Ile de France region to alleviate the pressure on central Paris by shipping
out some of its biggest industrial tenants to the west. Esso, Elf-Aquitaine,
Total, IBM and Saint-Gobain are already there.
The tall towers of La Defense now loom over the city and Jean Nouvel, the
futuristic architect, has been commissioned to build another, even bigger
Tour Sans Fins.
7. BERCY, or so the French government hopes, will eventually become the
financial district of eastern Paris.
President Mitterrand gave the development a kick-start by exiling the
finance ministry there. Mr Michel Sapin, the present incumbent, now speeds
along the Seine to and from the National Assembly in his gunmetal grey
powerboat.
Bercy also boasts the Omnisport stadium and, what is expected to be, one of
the world's main wine markets. But its progress has been hindered by the
fact that large tracts of Bercy office space have come on to the market in
the depths of the property slump.
