exploded at the Paris Opera with the sacking of its music director

When the Paris Opera Orchestra meets today for the first time since the
summer holidays, it is unlikely to make music. The players are almost
certain to vote for a strike in support of their sacked music director,
Myung-Whun Chung. Without an orchestra, the Opera will be unable to open its
season in two weeks' time.
A strike at the Opera is nothing new. It has been a financial,
administrative and artistic mess for the past 15 years. Its huge, high-tech
Bastille headquarters - inaugurated in 1989 as one of President Francois
Mitterrand's grands travaux - has only made matters worse, lurching from one
catastrophe to the next.
But this dispute is different. It is the first major upset to the French
government's plan to restructure the Opera, restore its artistic credibility
and reduce its deficit. That plan places complete executive power in the
hands of one man - Hugues Gall, an internationally-respected opera
administrator who currently runs Geneva's Grand Theatre. He is due to take
up his post in Paris next summer.
Gall, assisted by the Opera's interim management, opened talks with Chung in
March, aimed at renegotiating the Korean conductor's lucrative long-term
contract. As it stood, the contract invested Chung with artistic powers
which Gall himself expected to assume. Gall wanted to reduce Chung's
responsibilities, to shorten the contract and limit his pay. At the end of
June, Chung received an ultimatum saying that unless he accepted the terms
offered, the contract would be annulled. On August 12, he was dismissed.
Since then, the conflict has descended into a legal tussle, with Chung
waging a vociferous public campaign to portray himself as the wronged party.
He appeared to win an important victory last week when a Paris court ordered
his reinstatement - at least until the grounds for his dismissal were
clarified (which might take months). But the ruling could not be enforced:
by a quirk of French law, no one can forcibly enter a public establishment
against the wishes of its management. On arriving at the Bastille, Chung and
his lawyer found their way to the rehearsal room barred by the interim
director, Jean-Paul Cluzel, and a posse of security men. The locks to his
office had been changed. His furniture was impounded.
Until now, Chung has had the biggest voice in the Opera's artistic
decision-making. He had a free hand in choosing repertoire, guest
conductors, production teams and singers. His contract guaranteed him a
minimum of 30 performances a year, rising to 50 over an eight-year period.
His fee for each performance would have increased from FFr80,000 (Pounds
10,000) in 1992 to FFr177,000 (Pounds 20,000) by 2000. He was also paid a
salary as music director. The package was worth FFr3.5m a year at the time
of his dismissal - or FFr8m (Pounds 1m) by the end of the decade. It was a
time-bomb planted by Pierre Berge, Chung's patron and friend of President
Mitterrand, in the dying months of the last Socialist government. Berge knew
it would blow up in the face of an incoming centre-right administration with
its own ideas about how to run the Opera.
Chung's pay made good headlines, but the crux of his conflict with Gall was
artistic power. 'Gall made it clear he had to take all the decisions,' says
Chung. 'Of course you need a strong man at the top, but not a dictator. I
have never taken decisions alone on casts and production teams. In any
normal situation, the management discusses these with the conductor, and a
decision is taken by mutual agreement. Under the terms I was offered, they
could have told me to conduct 40 ballet performances and I would have had no
choice.'
Chung was appointed shortly before the Bastille opened in 1989, a
little-known 36-year old who did not even speak French. The Opera orchestra
had been decimated by months of inactivity. In the five intervening years,
Chung has been the only stable element in the Opera's administration. While
a string of managers came and went, Chung filled the vacuum and accumulated
power. He made the orchestra his priority - defending its rights, improving
standards and bringing in lucrative recording work. He enjoyed his job at
the Bastille, and wanted to continue.
Chung's dedication and skill earned him the respect of a notoriously
fractious group of musicians. 'It was anarchy when he came,' recalls the
cellist Marc Latarjet. 'He did a good job, he raised our profile. We had
concerts, recordings and tours, so we weren't always stuck in the pit.
Nobody will do this for us in future. We need a music director to keep
discipline and resolve our problems. Now someone wants to destroy the only
thing that was good in this troubled house.'
Gall had always made clear that Chung would not figure strongly in his
plans. He did not need a music director; at most, he wanted someone to keep
the orchestra in shape. While acknowledging Chung's achievements, Gall says
the conductor's advisers exaggerated his experience and ability. 'Chung
makes himself out to be on the level of the top ten conductors in the world.
The gap between his performance and theirs is important. If you look at
Haitink at Covent Garden, he has none of the powers in Chung's contract, and
not half the money.'
Gall's brief is to put the Opera in order. To do that he must run it the way
Rudolf Bing ran the Met for 22 years, the way Gall's mentor Rolf Liebermann
ran the Opera in the 1970s - with absolute power gathered in his hands
alone. Those were the conditions on which he accepted the job. He had no
intention of sharing responsibilities with Chung.
Gall set out his plans in a report last autumn. He would stick to agreed
spending limits. He would close both theatres (the Palais Garnier and the
Bastille) at different times, to carry out the repairs and investment
necessary to their efficient running. He would transfer the grand classical
ballets to the Bastille, and return a select slab of the opera repertory to
the Garnier. He would provide a quick injection of what the Opera has been
missing - mainstream repertory in non-weird productions, capable of being
frequently revived. On the basis of these reforms, he hoped to lure back the
top-rank conductors who have shunned the Opera since the Liebermann era.
Gall is viewed by most observers as the one person capable of sorting out
the Opera's problems. His only mistake so far is to have expected Chung to
go quietly.
