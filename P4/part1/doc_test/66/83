THE FRENCH will probably never forgive them for the congenital misfortune of
being British, but even the snooty Gault Millau guide has been forced to
admit, albeit very grudgingly, that Mark Williamson and Tim Johnstone run
one of the very best wine bars in Paris.
Willi's, their wine bar, on rue des Petits-Champs between the Bibliotheque
Nationale and the Palais Royal is now a firm fixture on the Parisian wine
scene.
Williamson and Johnstone, both of whom worked in the English wine trade
before setting up Willi's in 1980, scour the Rhone valley, Bourdeaux and
vineyards in further flung places, California, Australia and even Italy, for
new wines.
At first glance it looks as though they must have been crazy - to think that
the French would buy wine, and even food, from two Brits. But Tim Johnstone
says that when they hatched their original plan to open Willi's in the late
1970s, they were convinced there was a gap in the market - 'at the time
there just weren't any really good wine bars around,' he says.
Times have changed and competition has hotted up. Nicolas, the chain of wine
shops, has opened a string of L'Ecluse wine bars all over the city. L'Ecluse
specialises in Bourdeaux wines, selling everything up to Grands Crus, and
serves perfectly palatable salads, fish dishes, foie gras and San Daniele.
L'Ecluse is a chain, but its choice of prettily renovated bistros, means
that it avoids the antiseptic feel of most of the 'corporate' cafes in
Paris. Its wine bars are also among the few places where it is really nice
to eat in the very touristy areas, such as the one on quai des
Grands-Augustins along the Left Bank by place Saint-Michel.
Anyone with more traditional taste should head for Le Rallye on rue Daguerre
in the 14th arrondissement, which has been in the hands of the Peret family
for three generations, and does, or so they say, sell the best Beaujolais in
Paris with a choice of 200 bottles.
Devotees of Loire wines may prefer La Cafe de la Nouvelle Marie on rue des
Fosses-Saint-Jacques by the Sorbonne, where you can sit out in the leafy
square on sunny days. La Sancerre on avenue Rapp by the Eiffel Tower
specialises, as its name suggests, in Sancerre wines.
La Cloche des Halles on rue Coquilliere by the Les Halles shopping centre is
a classic bustling bistro, packed with chattering Parisians which serves
hearty food and good wines, bottled on the premises. Meanwhile Le Forum on
boulevard Malesherbes by the Madeleine is the classic Parisian bar with its
Art Deco decor, little plates of olives and nuts, a choice of 150 (killer)
cocktails and its very enigmatic clientele.
La Cloche and Le Forum are favourite haunts of the Willi's team, Mark
Williamson and Tim Johnstone, when they are checking out the competition.
Johnstone also recommends Ange Vin on rue Richard Lenoir in the Bastille
district for 'really good, very cheap wines' and 'a cheerful atmosphere', or
Le Moulin a Vin on rue Burq, north of the Pigalle sex district, which he
describes as 'a funky place with down-to-earth food and a good choice of
wine.'
