The government is trying to tilt the city's axis to the east in an effort to
spread wealth to a deprived part of the capital, which suffers from
industrial dereliction and the concentration of decision-makers in the west.
To help the process, it is prepared to move one of its key government
ministries to the east. But the project's momentum is threatened by the poor
state of the market after a fall-off of demand and a surge in building
following a relaxation of controls.
The description fits both London and Paris. This tale of two cities contains
many parallels, although the contrasts are perhaps even more striking.
Tax incentives and laissez-faire planning policies have been at the heart of
developing London's east end in recent years. The development of Paris,
however, is being forged by a policy of interventionism, extravagant
government gestures and partnerships between the public and private sectors.
As with London, the need to regenerate eastern Paris was recognised by the
authorities in the 1970s. But it was not until 1983 that the Council of
Paris drew up its planned programme for east Paris. The proposals have been
reinforced with the region's structure plan, the Livre Blanc, published in
1990, and blueprints drawn up by Mr Jacques Chirac, the mayor of Paris,
which featured 'Zacs' - partnerships between the public and private sectors.
Both London and Paris have been confronted with the challenge of changing
the image of their eastern districts. In spite of being close to the heart
of Paris, the eastern arrondissements of the city have more than their share
of urban blight, poor housing and high unemployment. Although the eastern
arrondissements are not as cut off from the centre as London's Docklands,
there is a need for improved transport. A new metro will be completed by
1996, cutting the journey from Bercy to Gare St Lazare from 20 to 6 1/2
minutes.
In Paris, some grand projects, most notably the new opera house built on the
site of the old Bastille railway station, created a wave of publicity.
Yet more publicity was generated with the launch of the Seine Rive Gauche
development, a new business district which will eventually stretch along
both banks of the Seine in the 12th and 13th arrondissements.
Developers are also trying to inject some life into the area. Bercy village,
which is due to be completed in the next two years, is a shopping district
located in renovated wine warehouses and their vaulted cellars, with more
than 100 restaurants and boutiques.
Perhaps the most significant development has been Euro-Disney, 32km to the
east. Many French people are sceptical about its influence, but its
supporters believe that the publicity before its opening earlier this year
and the sheer number of visitors will be a huge boost to the eastern side.
The government has moved its ministry of finance from the Louvre to a huge
edifice in Bercy. In spite of the architectural merits of the Bercy
premises, the move was not welcomed by officials. 'It is rather like taking
the UK home office to Croydon (in south London),' says Mr Robert Waterland,
president of surveyors Jones Lang Wootton, Paris.
Bercy has yet to win the hearts of Parisians. Changing the character of an
area and the preconceptions of its citizens takes time. The growth of the
east will also be affected by the fall in the Paris property market. 'The
east is in danger of losing its economic edge,' says Mr Waterland.
The Seine Rive Gauche scheme resulted in a bout of speculative fever in
1988-89. 'In anticipation of the success of the project, developers were
quick to buy sites in surrounding areas, trusting that the idea of a new
office pole would be enough to attract occupiers. In a less buoyant market,
however, take-up has been lower than expected,' says Jones Lang Wootton.
If the intention of moving the finance ministry to Bercy was to establish a
new financial district in the area, the task is likely to be a lengthy one.
Societe Generale, the French bank, had been interested in relocating to
another development area on the left bank of the Seine, but it could not
reach agreement on the price of land and so decided to move to La Defense.
But it would be a mistake to underestimate the government's powers of
persuasion. While the UK government has used rates holidays and tax breaks -
with mixed success - to develop London's Docklands, the French government
has rather more direct influence over company relocations. Tenants need to
win official approval before they take on large amounts of new space.
Moreover, developments on the western side of Paris are being discouraged.
In 1988 Mr Michel Rocard, then prime minister, announced measures to favour
the less sought-after eastern suburbs of Paris, away from the popular area
of La Defense.
'Ten years from now it will be comparable to La Defense,' says Mr
Jean-Pierre Hennequet, managing director of the New Bercy project, which
comprises Bercy village along with 50,000 square metres of offices, a food
and drink trade centre, a hotel, conference centre and cinema in the old
wine district.
The comparison is pertinent. Indeed when London and Paris compare notes, the
parallel is usually drawn is between La Defense and Docklands.
La Defense, like London's Docklands, is seen as a less expensive alternative
to the central business district and, like Docklands, it has not always had
an easy ride. However, there the similarities end. The French government has
had a hands-on involvement with the project, most notably with its generous
provision of transport links.
The origins of La Defense date back to President Georges Pompidou, who was
keen to develop a business capital, partly, it was said, in a bid to
accommodate the offices of the European Community.
The plan was slow to get off the ground. 'After the oil slump of the 1970s
it was a disaster,' says Mr Colin Bird of DTZ, the international agency of
surveyors Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks. 'We were trying to let buildings at
rents that would cover the service charges.'
Since then La Defense has taken off: it is prestigious, well connected and
cheaper than the central business district, where the typical office
building is more than 100-years-old and lacks large floor spaces and
air-conditioning. 'It has a good image, better than the Golden Triangle (the
area at the heart of Paris) in some respects,' says Mr Jean-Pierre Pajon of
Gleeds, a long established UK firm of quantity surveyors in Paris.
When the US brokers Salomons visited La Defense it was impressed with its
list of prestigious tenants. 'If Brussels is the political capital of
Europe, then La Defense is the corporate capital of modern Europe,' it
concluded.
La Defense is not to everyone's taste. It is often described as a concrete
jungle; many Parisians shudder at the idea of living there, even though it
has some 200 shops, 20 restaurants and nine cinemas.
The most recent example of government intervention in Paris is the Grande
Arche de la Defense. This hollowed-out cube would easily accommodate Notre
Dame and its towers. Its alignment with I M Pei's glass pyramid in the
courtyard of the Louvre museum, the obelisk of the Place de la Concorde and
the Arc de Triomphe adds to its monumental qualities.
In spite of its emphasis on the development of the east, the French
government has not turned its back on La Defense. In August 1990 it unveiled
a Fr10bn urban development scheme that will double La Defense's area and
extend the thoroughfare starting at the Louvre a further two miles past La
Defense. The emphasis will be on housing.
Paris is currently an unlikely model of planning and development. The city
has been hit hard by the slump in the property market, following temporary
planning deregulation in the mid-1980s which led to an increase in supply.
None the less vacancy rates are among the lowest of any European capital at
less than 5 per cent. And by avoiding the laissez-faire policies of other
European markets, Paris has escaped the peaks and troughs of the US and UK.
On current evidence, the regeneration of the French capital's eastern
districts is likely to be more successful than the comparable efforts in
London.
