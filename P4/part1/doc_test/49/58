  [Text] The President, Flight Lieutenant J.J. Rawlings, this 
morning, opened the second session of parliament at the 
International Conference Center in Accra. He reviewed the 
overall performance of the government over the past year and 
outlined its program for this year. President Rawlings touched 
on all aspects of national life. Tina Teoda attended the 
opening ceremony: 
  [Begin recording] [Teoda] President Rawlings said the past 
year saw some positive developments on the political front but 
wished that challenges relating to the constitutionality of 
certain government actions be confined to sober and principled 
issues. He said many of the issues raised in constitutional 
cases before the Supreme Court involved serious practical 
problems, not just for government but also for the public at 
large. President Rawlings said it would be ideal if the public 
would inform the police about meetings and demonstrations for 
the necessary precautionary measures to be taken. 
  [Rawlings] I would also wish that challenges relating to the 
constitutionality of certain government actions will be confined 
to sober and principled issues and not become what sometimes 
seems to be a legal or political thought. Mr. Speaker, Ladies 
and Gentlemen, many of the issues raised in constitutional cases 
before the Supreme Court involve serious practical problems not 
just for the government but also for the public at large. On 
the terms of one of these rulings, the police feel powerless to 
prevent gatherings likely to lead to violence such as those 
relating to stool disputes and can only intervene when trouble 
actually erupts. While a permit may not be required before 
public processions and demonstrations are held, we believe that 
it would be judicious to impose a duty on the public to inform 
the police in advance before such processions and demonstrations 
to enable them institute the necessary precautions and security 
measures. We shall examine the Supreme Court decision to see 
whether the necessary flexibility exists to enable us introduce 
a bill in this House to that effect for the sake of the public. 
  [Teoda] Touching on the recent court decision on celebrating 
the anniversary of the 31 December Revolution, President 
Rawlings says the government will respect the constitutional 
provision of the Supreme Court but cannot allow one arm to stage 
a coup d'etat against the other. 
  [Rawlings] The recent narrow majority decision of the 
Supreme Court about the celebration of 31 December Revolution 
also raises fundamental questions about the store of the Supreme 
Court's functions vis-a-vis the legislative powers of parliament 
and indeed the prerogative of the executive. The experience of 
constitutional democracy teaches us that nothing is gained from 
confrontationist or subversive attitudes from elements in any 
arm of government. Mr. Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen, we will 
respect the constitutional provision of the Supreme Court, but 
we cannot allow that almost government to stage what was a coup 
d'etat against the other government. And come to think of it, I 
thought the Constitution had proscribed coup d'etats in any 
form. In any case, it is true that the year 1994 will see these 
two arms of government complementing each other for the sake of 
our people. 
  [Teoda] The president said accountability is not a mere 
watchword and must reflect in the smallest actions of all. He 
said the country still has to contend with adverse external 
economic factors. He outlined the program for this year. 
  [Rawlings] The main thrust of our economic program for 1994 
will be to further accelerate rural and self urban development, 
employment generation to mount the program of vigorous 
diversification and promotion to build on the progress that has 
already been made, as well as to attack waste and malfeasance in 
public finance management and expenditure. As you all know, the 
auditor-general's report submitted to parliament last year 
revealed a very painful and unacceptable catalogue of waste, 
irresponsible resource management in several ministries, and 
malpractices in various departments and organizations. This 
will be unforgivable at any time and more so when our resources 
are stretched thinly to cover our many responsibilities to the 
people of this nation. The irregularities revealed by the audit 
will be followed up and appropriate action taken. Even more 
important, steps will be taken to prevent their recurrence in 
the future. The Ministry of Finance as well as all the heads of 
all sectors and organizations have been charged to strengthen 
measures to ensure effective financial management within all 
government bodies, including all otherwise independent bodies 
such as commissions, councils and boards, which depend on 
government funds. Accountability is not a mere watchword. It 
must reflect in the smallest actions of each one of us. It is 
not enough to be satisfied with our own personal integrity and 
good intentions if those working under our authority and 
supervision dissipate resources whether through laxity and 
carelessness, or with selfish intent. We have undertaken a 
review of the present structure of the government machinery with 
a view to enhancing efficiency and avoiding waste. Accordingly, 
the existing ministerial arrangements will be rationalized and 
function amalgamated where this would not affect the focus of 
the sectors concerned. 
  [Teoda] President Rawlings also examined the country's 
present and future roles in international affairs. He hinted 
that there would be a re-orientation of foreign service 
officers and ambassadors to be more effective in promoting the 
interests of the country. He commended [word indistinct] and 
urged parliament to continue working in the spirit of openness.
