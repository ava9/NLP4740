  [Text] THE GHANAIAN DEMOCRAT and THE INDEPENDENT comment 
on relations between Ghana and Togo. THE DEMOCRAT recounts 
atrocities meted out Ghanaians living in Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire 
and, recently, Togo, and says in addition to killing Ghanaians, 
the Togolese have, for the first time, violated Ghana's 
territorial integrity. THE DEMOCRAT therefore calls on the 
government not to continue toeing what it calls the soft line in 
the face of the savage acts perpetrated against Ghanaians in 
Togo. It hopes this is the last time lives of Ghanaians would 
have been wantonly lost. 
  On its part, THE INDEPENDENT says it believes that Ghanaians 
do no want to go to war with Togo. An internationally arranged 
meeting between Presidents Rawlings and Eyadema on a neutral 
ground could therefore bring about peaceful coexistence.
