  [Excerpts] Lome, Jan 7 (AFP) -- Togolese troops and police 
sealed off the capital Friday [7 January] and fighting was 
reported along the border with Ghana after a bloody coup bid 
that officials said was launched from the neighbouring country. 
  Frightened residents stayed off the streets of Lome, which 
was generally quiet after two days of shooting and artillery 
fire that begun with an attempt Wednesday to assassinate 
President Gnassingbe Eyadema. 
  The assassination bid and a subsequent attack on the Tokoin 
military barracks where Eyadema has his official [residence] 
left at least 40 people dead, according to government officials. 
  A military source told AFP that a police post on the border 
with Ghana and several neighbouring houses had been destroyed 
overnight by "mortar fire from inside Ghanaian territory." 
  "Armed groups" tried to cross into Togo during the night but 
were driven back, the source added, refusing to comment on 
whether the attackers were exiled Togolese or Ghanaians. 
  Reached by telephone, residents living close to the border 
post separating Lome from its twin town of Aflao in Ghana said 
that shots and explosions had shaken the area shortly before 
1:00 A.M. (0100 GMT). 
  Early Friday, the Togolese foreign ministry announced that 
it 
had taken the Ghanaian charge d'affairs into detention and 
called on the government in Accra to intervene against "armed 
elements coming from Ghana." [passage omitted] 
  Lome was sealed off by soldiers, police and paramilitary 
police, who stopped all vehicles at roadblocks as rumours of 
"war with Ghana" spread through the city. [passage omitted] 
  Friday some fearful residents of this city of 600,000 people 
said they planned to flee with their families to Benin, which 
lies to the east of Togo, on the other side of the small West 
African nation from Ghana. [passage omitted]
