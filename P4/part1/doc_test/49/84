    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
disease reports monitored from FBIS Abidjan Bureau and EAU 
coverage areas. Source information is given in parentheses after 
each item. 
<H5>  Nigeria </H5>
  Iodine-deficiency disorders -- The Edo State commissioner 
for 
health has said that the (Akoko Edo), (Etsako East), (Etsako 
West), and Owan East local government areas in the state are 
severely affected by iodine-deficiency disorders, especially 
goiter. A campaign has been launched to control and eradicate 
the disease. [Lagos NTA Television Network in English 2000 GMT

  Measles/cholera -- Fifty-three children have died from an 
outbreak of measles and cholera in a village in southeast 
Nigeria where local officials feared the death toll could rise, 
the official NAN news agency said. The report released 13 April 
did not say when the diseases broke out, but said most of the 
victims were refugees from the disputed Bakassi Peninsula on the 
border with Cameroon. 
  The report quoted an official for the area, in Nigeria's 
Akwa 
Ibom state, who said emergency medical help was needed to keep 
the death toll from rising. 
  Last week, 25 children were reported to have died from 
measles in Uquo Ibeno village near the Bakassi peninsula, NAN 
said. Refugees who fled the disputed zone, a 1,000 
square-kilometer (400 square- mile) area rich in fish and oil, 
are camped in villages in nearby Akwa Ibom and Cross River 
states. 
  Nigeria and Cameroon have vowed to find a diplomatic 
solution 
to the dispute, which broke out early this year, but both have 
sent troops to the zone. (Paris AFP in English 1657 GMT 14 Apr

<H5>  Burkina Faso </H5>
  Measles/cerebro-spinal meningitis -- The director of public 
health has disclosed that this year's incidence of measles was 
not as high as last year's. Some isolated cases of 
cerebro-spinal meningitis have been reported. According to 
statistics there were more cases this year than last year, but 
the situation could not be described as an epidemic. In the 
case of Yalgado Ouedraogo Hospital -- where there have been 
rumors of a new, deadly form of meningitis -- from 1 January to 
31 March 1993, 70 cases were recorded, with 27 deaths reported 
for all forms of meningitis. This year, for the same period, 97 
cases were recorded, with 31 deaths. Although the number of 
cases this year is higher than that of last year, it should be 
noted that all these cases do not come from one locality.

<H5>  Ghana </H5>
  Malaria -- Malaria is still the No. 1 killer disease in 
Ghana. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, 
especially among children below the age of five, and accounts 
for nearly 30 percent of all clinic attendance in the country. 
Malaria, related to development and economic activities, is 
even more rapidly becoming a major problem. As a way of 
controlling the vector and the disease, the Ministry of Health 
in 1992 worked out a plan of action for the control of malaria. 
The director of technical coordination, Dr. Kofi Ahmed, said 
that the action plan, which is now being implemented, has a 
long-term objective of reducing the incidence of malaria to 
tackle levels that will make it cease to be a public health 
hazard. He said a series of workshops has been set up to train 
health workers to accurately diagnose what malaria is and the 
correct treatment for the disease. Dr. Ahmed said apart from 
medical care, which will be the major strategy, vector control, 
house education, and revision of health legislation are some of 
the strategies that would be pursued. [Accra Ghana Broadcasting 
Corporation Radio Network in English 1300 GMT 19 Apr 94] 
  Measles/cholera -- The regional director of medical services 
in the Upper East Region has told the GRAPHIC that there is an 
outbreak of measles affecting children between the ages of five, 
six, and seven in the region. The TIMES also reports that 
cholera has claimed the lives of 16 people in Sefwi Akotombra.

<H5>  Niger </H5>
  Measles/malnutrition -- A high incidence of measles and 
malnutrition has been reported in Dosso recently. This year, 
the district almost experienced a measles epidemic, with close 
to 75 cases a week per health center. Most of the cases involved 
children who had not been vaccinated. Fortunately, with the 
arrival of the first rains, there has been a decline in the 
disease. Around 25 to 30 cases of malnutrition were recorded in 
the first quarter of this year. [Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in 
French 1200 GMT 22 Apr 94] 
<H5>  SAO-TOME AND PRINCIPE </H5>
  AIDS -- It was reported today that Sao-Tome authorities 
estimate that at least 1,200 people carry the AIDS virus in 
Sao-Tome and Principe. This estimation is, however, very likely 
below the actual figure, since the government so far has not had 
any means to control the spread of the epidemic, a medical 
source also stated. 
  Thirteen cases of the disease were recorded in the 
archipelago for a total population of about 120,000 inhabitants, 
according to the conclusions of a seminar organized during the 
visit of some Portuguese student nurses. A national AIDS 
control program has been launched in Sao-Tome thanks to external 
financing, mainly from the WHO and Western countries. 
Furthermore, an epidemiologic investigation is under way on a 
part of the archipelago to know this disease in Sao-Tome. [Paris
