  [Text] The DAILY GRAPHIC has an exclusive story on its 
front page about an alleged coup plot. According to the paper, 
its special investigation team has discovered that an alleged 
threat to editors of some private papers is actually a ploy of 
diversion for a coup plot to take place between the 7th and the 
15th of this month. A special report named the editors as that 
of the STATESMAN, Mr. Haruna Atta, and Mr. Eben Quarcoo of the 
FREE PRESS. It also mentioned Major Courage Quashiegah, a 
leading member of the New Patriotic Party, as another target of 
the alleged assassination threat.
