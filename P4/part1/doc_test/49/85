meningitis, 32 fatal, have been reported at Segou in the Fourth 
Region. The worst affected districts are (Nguema-Sylla), Sahn, 
and Segou where eight, 84, and 11 cases have been reported, 
respectively. Preventive measures have been put in place for

  AIDS -- The Tahoua Department is among the areas most 
affected by AIDS in the region. In 1993, 180 cases were 
diagnosed in Tahoua Hospital alone. According to a recent 
study, 1.4 percent of 650 pregnant rural women were 
HIV-positive. Most of these women were contaminated by their 
husbands returning home after months away. Today, the situation 
remains status quo. The hospital's AIDS laboratory tests have 
been suspended due to lack of equipment for blood collection. 
Blood donors fear contamination and, as a result, the blood 
bank is empty. (Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in French 1200 GMT

  Meningitis -- A meningitis epidemic has taken hold of Maradi 
Department. Most of the victims of the disease are children

to die from the disease. The rapidly-spreading epidemic broke 
out in November 1993 in Sahoda village, in Madaroumfa District. 
About 200 cases were reported in March. Cases have also been 
reported in Adjie, Tessaoua, and poorly accessible areas in
