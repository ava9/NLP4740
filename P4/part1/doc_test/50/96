Emily Short turned in another outstanding performance Tuesday night, breaking 
the U.S. Olympic Festival record in the 200-meter breaststroke by more than 
four seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Short, 14, who Monday night swam the second-fastest 100 breaststroke in the 
world this year, finished the 200 in 2 minutes 32.71 seconds. The previous 
festival record of 2:36.83 was set in 1987 by Laura Gandrud of Bloomington, 
Minn. 
</P>
<P>
"I now feel I have more of a chance (to make the '92 Olympic team) than I did a 
week ago," said Short, of Phoenix. "I'm more positive about it now than after 
last night. I just have to work a lot harder than I have been." 
</P>
<P>
Sean Gouldson of Chelmsford, Mass., won the 100 backstroke in 57.37 seconds, 
breaking the festival record of 57.51 set by Rick Carey in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Eight festival swimming records were set in the three days of competition. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Ford's layup with seven seconds left gave the South a 121-120 victory 
over the North in the gold-medal basketball game, and after the bronze-medal 
game, Princeton Coach Pete Carril declared he had had enough of all-star teams. 
</P>
<P>
The East women beat the West, 76-54, for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, a guard at Missouri, finished with 24 points to lead the South, which won 
despite a low-scoring night from 7-foot-1 Shaquille O'Neal of LSU. O'Neal had 
89 points in the first three games but scored only nine on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Damon Bailey, whose three-pointer had given the North a 120-119 lead with 17 
seconds remaining, led his team with 25. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's game, the East broke away quickly at the start of each half in 
rolling to victory. Tracy Lis of Providence led the winners with 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
In the bronze medal games, the East men beat the West, 101-98, and the North 
women beat the South, 76-74, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
After his team won the bronze, Carril said: 
</P>
<P>
"No offense to the guys on my team, but this makes me appreciate my players (at 
Princeton). These guys worry too much about how many minutes they're going to 
play, who's going to take the shot, who's going to do this. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them yesterday, 'You guys sleep together, you stay in the same dorm, 
you eat together and yet when guys are wide open, you pass them up.' " 
</P>
<P>
In archery, 46-year-old Barry Weinperl set a final-round Grand FITA record with 
334 points after almost not qualifying for the six-man finals. 
</P>
<P>
Weinperl's victory marked the second consecutive year the oldest archer has won 
the event. In 1989, Ed Eliason of Stansbury Park, Utah, won it at age 50. 
</P>
<P>
Weinperl's score for 36 arrows eclipsed the previous final-round record of 332 
by Jay Barrs of Tempe, Ariz., in 1987.
