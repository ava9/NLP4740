Here's what this weekend offers: formation flying, fly-overs and the 
opportunity to see at close range both the latest in military aircraft as well 
as venerable World War II war birds. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, the romance of an air show. And if you've been smitten with the Blue Lady 
of the Sky, what better place to rendezvous than at Aviation Expo '89 at the 
Van Nuys Airport this weekend? 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Greater Van Nuys Area Chamber of Commerce, this free event, 
scheduled for today and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., will feature 
demonstration flying, entertainment, tours of the airport, celebrities and 
static displays. 
</P>
<P>
Attracted by the technological power and sheer beauty of flight, millions of 
spectators flock to air shows each year. Many seem to share the sentiments of 
author ("Sympathy for the Devil") and air-show devotee Kent Anderson. "These 
performances give people an opportunity to experience flying with a certain 
immediacy not available to them on films or TV," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, this type of spectacle flying began in the late '20s when 
competitive races were held at Mines Field -- at that time open agricultural 
land -- which has developed into today's Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
In 1929, Bobbi Trout, flying the Golden Eagle monoplane built by an Inglewood 
manufacturer, set an endurance record of more than 12 hours in the air. Trout 
landed at Metropolitan Airport, later renamed Van Nuys Airport, the busiest 
general-aviation facility in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
About as much emphasis will be necessary for automobile-traffic control as 
air-traffic control this weekend, when an expected attendance of more than 
100,000 people arrive for the Van Nuys show, which is themed "Aces in 
Aviation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bow to Contributors 
</P>
<P>
"We plan to honor the men and women who have made major contributions to 
flight, including pilots, engineers, designers and war aces," said Bob Hayes, 
airport public-relations director. 
</P>
<P>
The awards program will take place today and Sunday at 1:30 p.m. in the staging 
area. Among those to be honored are Bobbi Trout, who competed with Amelia 
Earhart in the late '20s to set distance and endurance records; she will 
receive the historical-achievement award. 
</P>
<P>
Among others slated for awards are John J. Fling, World War II radar engineer 
for Gilfillan Bros. Inc. (now ITT Gilfillan), and retired Air Force pilot Bill 
Anderson, who flew 200 Berlin Airlift missions. Astronaut Kathy Sullivan will 
receive a special-achievement award. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley chapter of the Ninety-Nines, an international 
organization of women pilots, will receive a community-service award. Col. 
William (Pete) Knight, X-15 test pilot and former vice commander of the Air 
Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, will receive a 
special-achievement award. United Airlines pilot Clay Lacy, who was aerial 
photographer for "Top Gun" and other films and set a round-the-world speed 
record with a Boeing 747, will receive recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Ritchie, a Vietnam Air Force flying ace, will receive an award, as will 
Lt. Lori Melling, a Navy test pilot who is among a select group of women 
assigned to tactical fighter aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Special awards will go to Bud Whalen for flight instruction; Allen Paulson, 
board chairman of Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., for general aviation 
contributions, and Norm Norton, air-traffic control supervisor at Van Nuys 
Airport, for air traffic-control achievement. 
</P>
<P>
The flying demonstrations will begin at 2:30 p.m. both days when an A-10 
Thunderbolt team, led by Capt. Jack King from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in 
Arizona, will perform. A squadron of fast-diminishing World War II P-51 
Mustangs will go through their paces, while sturdy C-130s, flown by the 
California Air National Guard, will perform flybys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Limited Spectacle Flying' 
</P>
<P>
Because of the heavily populated area, Hayes said, "we plan limited spectacle 
flying." Expo '89, however, will feature more than 50 military planes in static 
display, including the F-14 Tomcats, the fighter plane featured in "Top Gun," 
and other high-tech aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Among the planes to be viewed, and, in some instances, whose capabilities will 
be explained by pilots and volunteers, will be the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the 
EA-7 Corsair from Pt. Mugu Naval Air Station, the KC-10 from March Air Force 
Base, the P-3 Orion, several attack helicopters, the B-1 bomber and a number of 
vintage aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
In the vintage-aircraft area, Bill Rheinschild, a pilot active in the 
Confederate Air Force, a Texas-based group that restores and flies World War II 
aircraft, will exhibit his P-51 Mustang, a T-28, T-33 and T-6. Winner of an 
award at the Reno Air Races this year for his Mustang "Risky Business," 
Rheinschild considers the P-51 a "wonderful craft to fly. It made long-range 
bombing possible and turned the tide of the war," he said. "One reason pilots 
participate in air shows is to demonstrate and explain their planes in an 
effort to further interest in aviation and help young people think about 
careers." 
</P>
<P>
"We also want people who served (in the military) to know their efforts aren't 
forgotten," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Guilford, chief pilot for the recently opened Museum of Flying in Santa 
Monica and founder of the EAA-Warbirds of America (an international 
organization to preserve antique craft), plans to exhibit several of his own 
planes: an A-1 Skyraider, an attack fighter used in Korea and Vietnam, and an 
A-26 Invader, which, Guilford reports, was the only U.S. bomber to see action 
in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. He also will display, and if possible fly, 
his British-built, Supermarine Spitfire Mk XIV. 
</P>
<P>
Entry and parking for this weekend's show are free. Enter at 8030 Balboa Blvd. 
at the California Air National Guard sign. Call for information (818) 908-5965. 
Sixteen organizations, from aeronautical clubs to service groups, will sell 
food and run concession booths. Proceeds will be donated to various civic 
groups and charities in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Other air shows are scheduled during the year throughout Southern California. 
Among them are: 
</P>
<P>
Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego has scheduled its show Aug. 12 and 13. 
The Navy's Blue Angels will perform, as will the Army's Golden Knights 
parachute team. Aircraft on display will range from World War II fighters to 
current strategic bombers. In its 40th year, this is considered a major 
military show. Follow Interstate 5 to the 805; take Miramar Road east to the 
entrance. Free admission. Information: (619) 537-4082. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards Air Force Base will have open house, Oct. 29, 8 a.m.-4 p.m. Nearly half 
a million people have been attracted to this Air Force base and NASA research 
facility in past years to see such experimental aircraft as the SR-71 Blackbird 
(a high-altitude reconnaissance jet) and a U-2 spy plane. This year, planes in 
the developmental stage will include the X-29 and the X-15 Eagle (modified for 
short take-off and landing). Also on display will be modified F-16 fighters and 
the B-1B. There also will be a number of restored antique aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
At 10 a.m., the Air Force Thunderbirds, first launched as a demonstration team 
in 1953, will perform. 
</P>
<P>
From Interstate 5, take California 14. Look for Edwards AFB exit sign 11 miles 
north of Lancaster. Free admission. 
</P>
<P>
Pt. Mugu Naval Air Station has scheduled its annual show the weekend of Oct. 
28-29. The Thunderbirds are scheduled only for Oct. 29, but stunt flying, such 
as wing-walking and jet "dragster" racing, will be offered Oct. 28. At past 
shows, ground displays have featured a number of heavy-duty helicopters, many 
open for inspection. Because it's also the home of the Pacific Missile Test 
Center, Pt. Mugu is a good place to see models of advanced missiles and 
aircraft manufactured by such contractors as General Dynamics and Northrop. The 
air station is three miles south of Oxnard on Pacific Coast Highway. Free 
admission. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Aviation Air Show is scheduled for Nov. 11-12 at 
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport, 3000 N. Clybourn Ave. in Burbank. The show 
will feature planes of the past, such as the Ford Tri-Motor, DC-2, Lockheed 
Constellation and Lockheed Electra; as well as planes of the future. Admission: 
$5; parking $2. 
</P>
<P>
Chino Municipal Airport is the site of an annual show that features planes on 
the endangered-species list, many from Chino's own Planes of Fame Museum. The 
shows are scheduled the third weekend in May. 
</P>
<P>
This year, using 20 craft from the museum and others that were flown in, pilots 
demonstrated mint-condition P-51 Mustangs, the F-4U Corsair, P-40, P-47 
Thunderbolt and B-17 Flying Fortress. Howard Wilson, the museum's general 
manager, says the high point was unique formation flying by a German 
Messerschmitt, British Spitfire, American Mustang and Japanese Zero. 
</P>
<P>
From Los Angeles, take the Pomona Freeway (California 60) through Pomona; turn 
south on Euclid Avenue to the airport. Air show is $10 for adults, $5 for 
children under 12. Entrance to the museum is $4.95; children under 12, $1.95. 
Call for group rates. Rides in vintage planes offered at museum for $300 
donation. Museum information: (714) 597-3722. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, Santa Ana (714) 726-2937. Show held each year 
in late April at home of the Third Marine Aircraft Wing. The last show featured 
skywriting teams and dogfight routines, plus a demonstration by the Marine 
Corps Air-Ground Task Force. From the Santa Ana Freeway, take Sand Canyon 
Avenue exit left to Trabuco Road. Turn right and drive 500 yards to the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 When attending an air show, it's a good idea to wear layered clothing to 
accommodate climate changes during a long day outdoors. Bring a lightweight 
folding chair (one with attached umbrella is especially useful). Sunscreen 
lotion is a must, especially for children, and don't forget sunglasses and 
binoculars. Parents of toddlers may want to bring strollers. You might want to 
keep a cooler of beverages in your car for an all-day expedition. If you're 
attending a show on a military base, be sure to fill up the gas tank before 
entering.
