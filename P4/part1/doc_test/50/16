In 1929, an air derby featuring 20 women pilots hopscotching across the country 
in their open-cockpit planes was a big enough deal to draw thousands of 
cheering people to airstrips from Santa Monica to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was whether women could be aviators. The answer was yes, as amply 
demonstrated by such pioneering pilots as Amelia Earhart and First Women's Air 
Derby victor Louise Thaden. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a 1980s pilot, who happens to be a woman, will pay homage to Thaden 
and her cadre of trailblazers when she takes off from Santa Monica Airport to 
re-create the race on its 60th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Dusenbury, 40, a commercial pilot for Airborne Express, will be behind 
the controls of the restored Travel Air D4000 in which Thaden won her historic 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
She will be dressed in authentic 1920s aviator equipment, complete with goggles 
and hat that are essential in an open-air cockpit. There is no radar, radio or 
other communication device in the plane, Dusenbury said in a telephone 
interview from her home in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frequent Stops 
</P>
<P>
Dusenbury will find her way with a magnetic compass and by "winging it," that 
is, navigating by visual landmarks. The plane holds enough fuel for 3 1/2 
hours, so frequent stops are built into the trip. In Texas alone, she will 
touch ground at five different airports. 
</P>
<P>
A licensed airplane mechanic who has restored antique planes, Dusenbury said 
she flies her own plane to lunch every Saturday, meeting 20 to 70 fellow flying 
enthusiasts in Madison, N.C.. 
</P>
<P>
She has already delivered the Travel Air to California, where it is undergoing 
last-minute fine-tuning for takeoff tomorrow. Dusenbury said she is excited 
about honoring Thaden, a "great person and aviatrix" whose motto was "Take care 
of your engine and your engine will take care of you." 
</P>
<P>
"This derby symbolizes the dramatic achievement that women have made in 
aviation," Dusenbury said. "Louise Thaden was more than just a winner of this 
race. She represents the spirit of all women aviators, of their abilities and 
their courage." 
</P>
<P>
In the first derby, one of the pilots died en route and another landed in a 
field, put out a cockpit fire and took off again. According to Dusenbury, they 
ranged from socialites to country-bred, but shared the trait of independence. 
"I think you sort of had to have a mind of your own," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dusenbury said media interest in the 1929 race was fueled by its timing -- it 
had not been that long since women gained the right to vote. The race, later 
dubbed the "Powder Puff Derby," overshadowed a men's race that was taking place 
at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Thaden was involved in another first seven years later when she became the 
first woman to enter a race with men. Race sponsors offered one cash prize for 
the first-place winner and another for the woman who came in first. Thaden won 
the race and all of the money in an old worn-out plane. 
</P>
<P>
"She knew how to get speed," Dusenbury said.
