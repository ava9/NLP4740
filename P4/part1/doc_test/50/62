Matt Biondi, winner of seven Olympic swimming medals in Seoul last September, 
is expected to make his comeback as a swimmer next month. 
</P>
<P>
A comeback has been anticipated since Biondi quit the U.S. national water polo 
team last week, toward the end of a trip to Moscow and Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The trip was the first Biondi had made as a member of the national team. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi, who had worked out with the water polo team off and on since January, 
told Coach Bill Barnett that he was leaving the team while members were 
training in Berlin, according to Mike Sutton, team manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Barnett told me that Matt said he just didn't have the competitive drive 
to work his way up the ladder again," Sutton said. "He's really enjoying the 
work he's doing with his environmental projects and some of the other 
activities that are the fruits of his success in swimming, and he didn't want 
to make the commitment it would take to play international-level water polo. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course we were all disappointed. I think Matt could have become a top 
player. But the key word there is become. It would have taken a lot of time. 
It's a big step to go from college water polo (he was an All-American at 
California) to international water polo." 
</P>
<P>
Biondi's mother, Lucille, said that Biondi had called home Sunday from Berlin 
and told his parents that he was leaving the team. 
</P>
<P>
"He really didn't say much about his plans," she said. "All he said was that he 
couldn't compete for the water polo team because he didn't think he could 
afford the time commitment." 
</P>
<P>
Sutton said: "His schedule has been incredible. I'm sure he's tired. But I 
think he would like to get back into swimming. He and Tom Jager could still 
have some great races. I think they see some marketability there." 
</P>
<P>
Jager and Biondi have discussed the drawing power of rematches of the sprint 
races he and Biondi have had over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Jager, who finished second to Biondi in the 50-meter freestyle in Seoul a few 
days before his 24th birthday, stayed in swimming, proving that a sprinter can 
continue to compete beyond college age while holding a full-time job. Biondi is 
23. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi has been active with endorsements and appearances and reportedly has 
been able to cash in big on his Olympic gold. But, according to Jeff Dimond, a 
spokesman for U.S. Swimming, there would be no question of his eligibility and 
amateur status if he wanted to compete. 
</P>
<P>
"Matt has run all of his earnings through his swim fund, which FINA (the 
international governing body) administrates," Dimond said. "He had to do that 
to keep his eligibility for water polo. But both sports come under FINA, so 
there would be no problem." 
</P>
<P>
Biondi is currently in the Bahamas working on an environmental film. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Fick, meet director for the Los Angeles Invitational July 13-16 at USC, 
said that although he has heard that Biondi might be returning to swimming, he 
has had no official word from either Biondi, or his coach, Nort Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
"If he is coming back, though, he would have to swim in the national long 
course meet (also at USC) July 31-Aug. 4, because that's the selection meet for 
the teams that will compete in the Pan Pacific meet and in the U.S.S.R. meet," 
Fick said.
