It wasn't easy, but Cathy Hearn was doing her best to explain to a puzzled 
newcomer how she manages to stay among the top whitewater kayakers in the 
world, even though she's moved from the suburbs of Washington to rural 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
"Look," she finally said in gentle exasperation, "D.C. is the center of the 
paddling universe, okay? But it isn't the paddling universe." 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe you didn't know that here among the monuments in shining marble, the 
stately boulevards, the oppressive summer heat and the mile-high stacks of 
bureaucratic paper, a world-class sporting dynasty lurks. 
</P>
<P>
If you didn't, you'll find out over this weekend and next as the cream of 
international whitewater racing competes in the first world paddling 
championships ever held in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Six hundred slalom and wildwater canoeists and kayakers from 25 nations are now 
convened at the rumbling Savage River, a Potomac tributary in Western Maryland, 
for racing that begins Saturday. Few among them failed to make a stop in 
Washington along the way to pay tribute to some of the best in the game. 
</P>
<P>
It's been 10 years now since Hearn, 31, her brother Davey, 30, and suburban 
Washington neighbors Jon Lugbill and Bob Robison rocked the whitewater world 
with a dazzling display of boating virtuosity at the 1979 worlds in Jonquiere, 
Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Americans were uncontested champions of the paddling world. 
Lugbill, Davey Hearn and Robison swept the top three places in slalom canoe, an 
event no American ever had won before, and Cathy Hearn took three of the four 
gold medals in women's kayak, which no American had won before, either. 
</P>
<P>
In the decade since, Americans in general and Washingtonians in particular have 
set the pace in the fast-changing sport of whitewater slalom, which in 1992 
rejoins the Olympics for the first time in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, for example, Lugbill and Davey Hearn have finished one-two in every 
slalom canoe championship, Lugbill taking four of the five golds in such 
far-flung places as Bourg St. Maurice, France; Bala, Wales; and Merano, Italy, 
to become the top slalom canoeist of all time. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, lured by U.S. successes, top racers from England, Australia, France, 
Italy, New Zealand and elsewhere have migrated to train for weeks and months 
with Washington's elite on a Potomac River practice course just below Little 
Falls, not 10 miles from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Now come the worlds as partial reward. "The International Canoe Federation let 
us know they would look favorably on an American bid after we did so well again 
in 1983," said U.S. slalom team coach Bill Endicott. 
</P>
<P>
To understand the origins of Washington's whitewater phenomenon, it helps to 
know a bit about the nation's capital, its remarkable river and the highly 
motivated people it attracts. 
</P>
<P>
Endicott, for example, moved to town in the mid-1970s, fresh from a graduate 
degree at Harvard, with an ambition to fix some of the nation's social ills. He 
worked a while as a congressman's aide, then on the prestigious Democratic 
Study Group. 
</P>
<P>
But as an ex-whitewater paddler and Harvard oarsman, he couldn't help noticing 
the beautiful river cascading through his adopted city. Before long, he was out 
playing on Potomac whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
There he ran into Lugbill, the Hearns and a host of other local youngsters, all 
fired up about racing after Silver Spring, Md.'s Jamie McEwan won a bronze 
medal in slalom canoe in the 1972 Olympics, the only previous Olympics ever to 
feature the arcane sport. When the youngsters asked Endicott to coach them, he 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few years, Endicott had quit his career to devote full time to 
coaching, living off a modest trust fund and spending mornings and evenings 
hounding his charges up and down the Potomac with a stopwatch. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill wound up the perfect coach," said Cathy Hearn. "He provided organization, 
objectivity and helped the overall attitude of the group, but he didn't try to 
tell us what to do. 
</P>
<P>
"But the most valuable thing," she said, "was that he was a tireless, fanatical 
worker. Here was this volunteer killing himself for us. What were we going to 
do in return for him? The feeling was, we'd better deliver." 
</P>
<P>
And they did. In 1977, Robison, then 15, was fourth in slalom canoe at the 
world championships in Spittall, Austria. The Washington-based, two-man canoe 
team of Steve and Mike Garvis also took fourth and Cathy Hearn won a bronze 
medal in the women's kayak team race. 
</P>
<P>
That should have been fair warning to the world, but no one, not even the 
Americans, was prepared for the 1979 tour de force, which signaled the start of 
U.S. domination in a sport practically no one in the nation had even competed 
in before 1957. 
</P>
<P>
By 1981, decked canoes designed by Lugbill, Robison and Davey Hearn were the 
standard for the world, as they are today, and slalom paddling and 
boat-handling techniques the trio devised were miles ahead of anyone else's, as 
they also remain. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 18 years old when I won the world championship for the first time," said 
Lugbill, shaking his head in wonder during a lunch-hour break from his job as 
Potomac River water quality analyst for the metropolitan Washington Council of 
Governments. "That's amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Far more remarkable is the fact he remains world champion a decade later, with 
no one on the horizon except perennial Washington, D.C., rival Hearn and recent 
Washington transplant Jed Prentice even remotely likely to overtake him. 
</P>
<P>
Washingtonians have redefined whitewater slalom canoeing. To understand how 
requires a little background on the sport itself. 
</P>
<P>
Whitewater river-running underwent a sea change in the early 1960s with the 
advent of fiberglass boats. Before then, runs through rapids were hair-raising 
affairs in heavy, open, aluminum or wooden boats or folding, canvas-covered 
kayaks that needed patching after every run. 
</P>
<P>
Plastic provided a light, durable, cheap, easily repairable alternative. 
Suddenly, rampaging rivers that had been the province of daredevils and fools 
were approachable by the masses. 
</P>
<P>
A busy racing schedule evolved, with races following two forms. Slalom 
competitors ran 600-yard courses through 25 gates strung in the toughest 
places, with penalties if they touched the gatepoles; wildwater racers went 
five miles or so in a straight shot downriver with no gates, like downhill ski 
racers. 
</P>
<P>
Both disciplines flowered in Europe, where world whitewater championships had 
been held since 1949, but developed more slowly in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
McEwan's charge to Olympic bronze in 1972 changed that. "We were out on a 
geological expedition that summer," said Cathy Hearn, "and when we heard the 
news on the radio, I remember saying, 'That's for me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Washington, with the largest canoe club in the nation, the 2,000-member Canoe 
Cruisers Association, was just the place for the movement to take hold. And the 
new interest in paddling corresponded to a time of dramatically improving river 
quality as President Lyndon B. Johnson's mid-1960s pledge to make the Potomac 
swimmable began taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
The young Hearns found themselves increasingly headed to the river, where they 
bumped into Lugbill and his brother Ron; Robison; the Garvises; Lecky and Fritz 
Haller; Chris, Mike and Mark McCormick and a host of other would-be world 
beaters. 
</P>
<P>
In the rebellious days of the early '70s, "Our attitude was whatever had been 
done in the past, we weren't going to do," said Lugbill. "Anything that was 
status quo we changed." 
</P>
<P>
Lugbill and Robison became known for their frenetic paddling style, directly 
contrary to European traditions of smoothness and technique. The pair were 
comical figures on the river, crashing and flipping and running out of control. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Lugbill, Robison and Davey Hearn spent their spare time rubbishing 
old boat designs in an effort to shape a better hull. Conventional slalom 
canoes were too big, they decided, so they sawed a smaller kayak in half, 
expanded it to make it legal canoe size, and laid up a decked canoe in its 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters discovered that the sleeker, smaller boat made it possible to 
sneak under slalom gates sideways. That was much faster, and as they perfected 
techniques, Robison accidentally invented the quick "pivot turn" now favored by 
all slalom racers. 
</P>
<P>
Robison demonstrated his pivot to slack-jawed European competitors at the 1979 
worlds. For them, the American nightmare had begun, and old-school European 
slalom canoeists haven't fully recovered yet. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Europeans will win their share of medals on the Savage. The U.S. 
grip has slackened as the best American paddlers aged. Cathy Hearn is a long 
shot, at best, to win a medal this year; after several bouts of shoulder 
trouble, she's only the second-best U.S. women's kayaker behind Dartmouth 
graduate Dana Chladek, who moved to Washington to train two years ago. David 
Hearn at 30 is beginning to suffer aches and pains. 
</P>
<P>
The British have a stranglehold on men's and women's slalom kayak events, with 
three-time gold medalist Richard Fox a near lock in the men's division and 
countrymate Liz Sharman the favorite on the women's side. 
</P>
<P>
Americans never have dominated wildwater competition, which remains largely the 
province of Eastern Europeans, and in fact the United States has not taken 
overall national honors at the worlds since 1981, although it's been a strong 
second each year. 
</P>
<P>
But there will be special advantages for the Americans in having the event in 
their own backyard, while Soviets, Czechs, Aussies, French and New Zealanders 
wrestle with the cultural and social discombobulations the Americans long have 
endured overseas. 
</P>
<P>
But the voyage to Maryland's most rural county, with just 25,000 inhabitants 
and millions of trees, should be pleasant enough for foreigners. They'll enjoy 
the best whitewater racing stretch in the east. 
</P>
<P>
At night, the visitors may gaze upon a starlit summer sky, its brilliance 
undiminished by urban haze. And on the way home, they can always stop in 
Washington for a last glimpse of the paddling universe from the other side. 
</P>
<P>
From the center, looking out.
