close

THE picture suddenly bright-ened towards the close of dealings on the London
stock market yesterday when gilt-edged prices turned firmer, signalling a
more optimistic view of today's auction of Pounds 3bn of government
securities. Also helping share prices was the official US support for the
dollar, which reversed an initial gain in the pound, and also a sizeable buy
programme of UK equities from a leading US investment bank.
While trading volumes remained unexciting, the FT-SE 100 Index bounced
successfully at 2,812 to replace its early loss of 10 points with a gain of
similar proportions. The final reading put the index at 2,832.7, a net rise
of 10.4. Stock index futures helped to fuel the recovery in equities.
The London market was surprised by the appearance of the buying programme
from the US because much of its recent weakness appeared to originate from
across the Atlantic. An estimated value of around Pounds 125m was put on the
programme, in which the battered pharmaceutical sector rated highly; some
looked for favourable developments on the Clinton administration's
healthcare plans.
Earlier in the day, one of the leading London-based securities houses also
operated a large programme. Since many of the trades in both programmes were
protected trades, the details did not appear on the trading screens until
the end of the session, when they spurred the general recovery.
The programmes helped to boost equity turnover, as reported by the Seaq
system, to 596.6m shares yesterday from the 491.9m recorded on Monday, when
retail business only just scraped above the Pounds 1bn mark now established
as a daily minimum. Dealers are hopeful that equities will regain the centre
of the stage when today's gilt-edged auction is out of the way.
With the recent outbreak of bid speculation less active yesterday - United
Biscuits came off the boil - the market returned its attention to the basic
prospects of the economy and of corporate earnings.
Once again, the stock market paid little heed to signs of economic optimism,
making scant response to the latest industrial trends survey by the
Confederation of British Industry, which said that business confidence had
shown its highest monthly rise for a decade. Corporate trading figures from
the retail and building sectors brought no surprises for equities.
Caution regarding the market outlook was expressed at an investment
conference hosted in London by Kleinwort Benson Securities. The consensus of
fund managers was that the FT-SE 100 would be 7 per cent higher at 3,040 at
the year-end, and 13 per cent up at 3,190 in 12 months' time.
Potential problems of liquidity were raised by managers' inclinations to
increase holdings of Japanese equities, with London perhaps vulnerable in
view of impending cash demands for the government's funding programme, as
well as for planned fund-raising in equities by Zeneca and BT.
Against this backcloth, strategists pointed out that this week has seen the
Footsie drift down towards the low end of its trading range and a recovery
was to be expected; the question remains whether the market can successfully
challenge the existing year's high points in the 2,957 area.
