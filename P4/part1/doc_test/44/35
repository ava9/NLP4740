LONGER-dated gilts eased yesterday as the market absorbed
worse-than-expected average UK earnings figures for March and prepared for
today's inflation figures for April.
Earnings rose at a year-on-year rate of 7.5 per cent, up from 7 per cent the
previous month and ahead of expectations (although the figures for the
previous month were restated to 7.5 per cent on a new calculation basis).
The news was not devastating, but combined with unease about the retail
price index figure and some reported profit taking, helped to take the shine
off the gilt market.
The RPI is widely expected to show a year-on-year rise of around 4.4 per
cent, compared with 4 per cent the previous month - though some estimates
predict a rise as high as 5 per cent. Should the figure come close to the
lower expectations, the Bank of England is expected to sell more gilts,
another factor which helped to hold back gilt prices.
Shorter-dated gilts remained steady as sterling remained firm and the
three-month interbank rate remained at 10 1/16 per cent. The benchmark 9 per
cent bonds maturing in 2011, however, lost around  1/8 of a point on the day
to close at a yield of 9 per cent.
On Liffe, in moderate trading, the long gilt future - having broken above 99
at the start of the day - closed at 98 3/4 .
GERMAN government bonds lost ground in late trading as the market continued
to absorb bad news on the wage front and further warnings that interest
rates are likely to remain high for some time.
News that the largest of the four public sector unions, OeTV, had rejected
the pay offer negotiated by their leaders (only 44.1 per cent voted in
favour of acceptance, well short of the 50 per cent needed), did little to
dent the bund market immediately.
The news had been widely expected. But by late in the day, sentiment turned
for the worse.
The bund futures contract on Liffe, having opened at 87.26 and hit a high of
87.44, retreated to 87.15 in late trading. In the cash market, yields on
10-year bunds rose slightly, hovering just below 8 per cent.
Warnings that real interest rates were likely to remain high for some time
came from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president of the Bundesbank. He warned
against the 'quick fix' of lowering rates and added demand for capital
around the world would keep real interest rates high for some years.
PROFIT-taking by investors in French government bonds caused 10-year OATs to
lose some ground yesterday - though with bund prices also easing, the yield
spread between the two markets remained at just over 60 basis points.
The French franc fell from its recent high point, touched on Wednesday, but
continued to hover around its central rate against the D-Mark of 3.3539. The
yield on the benchmark 8.5 per cent OAT due 2002 slipped slightly to around
8.58 per cent in late trade.
PREDICTIONS from the Federal Reserve that money supply growth was exhibiting
a recovery took the edge off Treasury prices yesterday.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/16 at 102
9/16 , yielding 7.858 per cent, while at the short end of the market the
two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 1/2 , to carry a yield of 5.085 per cent.
The comments on money growth came from Fed governor Mr Lawrence Lindsey, who
said he expected the latest money supply data, due out late yesterday, to
show the beginning of a bounce back. This disappointed those sections of the
market which had pinned its hopes on further weakness in money figures
spurring the Fed into another easing of monetary policy.
Mr Lindsey's comments overshadowed the weekly jobless claims data, which
showed a rise of 10,000 in the number of people claiming state unemployment
insurance. The rise was bigger than expected, but the news failed to
stimulate any buying interest.
AFTER their strong rise in the middle of the week, Japanese government bonds
continued to move ahead yesterday, further buoyed by the strength of the
yen. The yield on the benchmark bond No 129 eased further, from 5.5 per cent
to 5.487 per cent on the day. The yield was last below 5.5 per cent in
mid-April.
However, concerns about the amount of new bond issuance due from Japanese
corporate borrowers continue to overhang the market, and could restrict
further gains.
