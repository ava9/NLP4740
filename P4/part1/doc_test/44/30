EUROPEAN and UK government bond prices soared yesterday, propelled by hopes
of lower interest rates.
Belgium provided the main inspiration for the continental bond markets as
the combination of a government economic recovery plan and sharp cuts in key
interest rates lifted bond prices by as much as a point.
The Belgian 10-year yield spread over German government bonds - which was
about 120 basis points earlier in the month - narrowed from 109 to 94 basis
points at one stage yesterday but ended at around 98 basis points.
The Belgian government's package of spending cuts and tax increases, aimed
at reducing the deficit while lifting competitiveness and employment,
allowed the central bank to cut its key interest rates.
The Belgian rate moves inspired rallies in several other European markets,
raising hopes of interest rate cuts elsewhere, while expectations that the
North American Free Trade Agreement would pass contributed to the markets'
generally enthusiastic mood.
FRENCH bonds ended sharply higher on hopes of a near-term rate cut by the
Bank of France.
Although the German market was closed for a public holiday yesterday, the
Liffe bund futures contract ended a quarter of a point higher on the day,
having traded in a range of 99.95 to 100.35 and ending at around 100.27.
While there is some speculation that the Bundesbank may announce cuts in the
key German interest rates today at the regular council meeting, dealers said
the majority view appeared to be for an easing in December. The
keenly-watched money supply figures are due this week while cost-of-living
data is expected next week.
NEWS of a sharp fall in inflation and a weaker-than-expected increase in
retail sales led to a sudden jump in UK government bond prices and renewed
speculation of a base rate cut in the near future.
Gilt prices rose across the board and ended as much as a point higher on the
day. The rally enabled the Bank of England to sell the remainder of its
outstanding tap issues.
LONG-DATED Japanese government bonds bounced back to life late in Tokyo
trading, with the result that cash and futures prices ended higher on the
day.
The market started on a weak note as medium-dated issues - which enjoyed
much of the recent rally in the bond market - underperformed and dragged the
rest down.
However, shortly before the futures market closed the market surged on
strong domestic investor interest and dealers covering short positions.
LONGER-dated US Treasury prices fell back after early gains on hopes of a
Nafta approval from Congress.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/8 at 101
13/16 , yielding 6.184 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 99 5/8 , to yield 4.059 per cent.
Although trading remained quiet, dealers had been confident that the House
of Representatives would pass the trade pact and longer-dated prices rose in
the morning.
Prices had been aided by expectations that the Federal Reserve would conduct
a coupon pass - an outright purchase of government securities - to meet
seasonal reserve requirements. Prices fell when the coupon pass did not
materialise.
THE Spanish Treasury will make its first issue of 15-year bonds in the
domestic market on December 2, the longest maturity previously being 10
years, Reuter reports from Madrid. The issue will carry a coupon of 8.20 per
cent, with amortisation in 2009. The Bank of Spain said the minimum amount
in this first tranche would be Pta100bn.
