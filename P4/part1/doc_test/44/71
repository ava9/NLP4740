unless the ERM crumbles - After a decade of exceptional real returns,
short-term prospects are less encouraging

THE CONSERVATIVES' emphatic election victory may be about to deliver UK
investors into a promised land of low and stable inflation; but no one is
quite sure how the investment landscape will change as the UK adjusts to
membership of the European exchange rate mechanism.
The real returns earned by UK pension funds on their equity portfolios over
the past decade have been exceptional. The average annual nominal return on
UK equities over the 10 years to the end of 1991 was 19.6 per cent.
Deflated by the average earnings index, which is the best indicator of the
change in their liabilities, this implies a real return of 11.3 per cent on
UK equities, compared with 6.3 per cent on UK fixed-interest securities and
 1 per cent on index-linked gilts. Little wonder, then, that UK pension
funds have both accumulated large surpluses in recent years and orientated
their portfolios towards equities.
But the short-term prospects for real returns do not look so encouraging.
The rate of economic growth is the most important long-run determinant of
real returns on equity investments. But current tensions within the ERM, and
the pain of adjustment to a low inflation regime, may depress real equity
returns over the next few years.
The total return on equity investments is equal to the dividend yield plus
the capital gain. The capital gain depends, in turn, on the expected future
stream of profits. Assuming that the share of profits in national income
remains stable, the main determinant of real profitability, and thus the
long-term real return on equity investments, is the real growth rate of the
economy.
History confirms the central role of GDP growth in determing long-run real
returns, according to a recent paper from Lombard Street Research. Mr Tim
Congdon and Mr Simon Ward show that the combination of an expected trend
rate of real economic growth of 2-2 1/2 per cent, added to an average
dividend yield of 5.2 per cent over the period 1955-90, implies an annual
real return of 7-8 per cent, before management fees.
A recent BZW study confirms their expectations: the average annual real
return on equities, with gross income reinvested, was 7.2 per cent over the
70 years to 1988, higher than target real return of 4-4 1/2 per cent
normally set by pension funds, but much below the real yield on equities in
the 1980s.
Yet this relationship between real returns on equities and trend GDP growth
tends to hold true only over very long periods: several decades, rather than
a few years. Real returns in the 1990s could stray from this long-run trend
for a number of reasons: sluggish economic growth; changes in the profit
share in GDP; or changes in market expectations.
ERM and European growth:
The clearest threat to UK economic growth, and thus real equity returns, is
the high level of nominal and real interest rates that Germany is imposing
on its ERM partners. Because Germany sets the floor for Europe's monetary
policy, the rest of Europe remains stuck with a combination of slow growth
and tight monetary policy. Even if the Bundesbank feels able to cut its
rates by the end of this year, as inflationary pressures abate, it is
unlikely to cut rates very far, very fast.
ERM and the UK:
UK rates may have to remain above those in other European countries. The
interest rate premium against German rates has narrowed to just half of a
percentage point. But if UK imports surge and the trade deficit widens, the
markets may become nervous once more about sterling's ERM parity.
In addition, there is still some way to go before UK industry fully adjusts
to life in the ERM. Annual wage inflation is still above 7 per cent, and
therefore remains higher than the European average. There may have to be a
few years of high unemployment and squeezed profits before UK unit labour
cost inflation falls to European levels.
Corporate profitability:
But UK productivity growth in the 1980s grew faster than in every main
industrialised country, except Japan; and output per person-hour in British
manufacturing is still only two thirds of the German level, suggesting that
there is room for further improvement.
UK equities benefited from the rise in the share of value-added that was
distributed in profits in the 1980s. According to the OECD, capital's share
rose from 30.3 per cent in 1975-79 to 31.5 per cent in 1980-87. Yet the rate
of return on capital in the latter period was virtually unchanged at 9.5 per
cent, well below the OECD average of 14.2 per cent.
Capital gains:
The main determinant of the rate of return on equities is likely to come
from short-run movements in share prices, as investors reassess their
expectations of the future. Congdon and Ward find that, over one-year
periods, changes in the return on equities come about largely through swings
in the dividend yield. Only over five-year periods do changes in dividend
growth matter. But even over 20 years the correlation between share-price
indices and output is weak, as the charts shows.
At first sight, the UK equity market does not appear over-valued. The
average price-earnings ratio of UK equities is broadly in line with long-run
trends; the prospect of low inflation could boost profitability; and the
ratio of nominal yields on bonds to equities has fallen to 1.95:1, lower
than its past average of 2.25:1
Yet low inflation combined with high and stable yields on bonds may reduce
the need for such a high nominal premium on fixed interest investments. If
inflation were to fall to 2-3 per cent a year, and economic growth remained
below trend for the first half of the decade, the current nominal yield gap
of 4 1/2 percentage points between bond and equity yields would make bonds
an attractive investment.
The market is not yet convinced that the UK will move into this
low-inflation world: the yield gap between nominal and index-linked gilts
remains nearer to 5 percentage points. The capital gains from falling
nominal yield may make bonds portfolios outperform equities during this
adjustment.
The strength of the UK's ERM commitment remains a central uncertainty. If
tensions in Europe were to boil over, the ERM were to crumble and the UK
were to return to its inflationary ways, then the short-term case for bonds
would quickly disappear.
