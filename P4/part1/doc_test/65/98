GREAT Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, the US supermarket operator in which
Germany's Tengelmann group holds a majority stake, reported a Dollars 189.5m
loss after tax in the year to February 27.
The loss contrasts with a Dollars 70.7m profit in the previous 12 months,
and comes on sales of Dollars 10.5bn, down from Dollars 11.6bn in 1991-92.
Much of the deficit is the result of a Dollars 151.2m write-off of A&amp;P's
investment in Isosceles, the UK company which bought out Gateway in a
leveraged deal, and a Dollars 90.1m charge related to accounting changes.
However, even at the operating level, A&amp;P posted sharply lower profits -
down from Dollars 203.9m in 1991-92, to Dollars 44.3m last year.
In the final quarter of the year, A&amp;P said it saw 'a reversal of the
company's previous sales decline, particularly in Canada'.
It added that it had begun 'its new financial year with an improving sales
and bottom-line performance'.
Nevertheless, the company still reported a Dollars 40.1m loss after tax in
the final three months, compared with a Dollars 16.1m profit in the same
period a year earlier.
The operating profit fell to Dollars 18.9m from Dollars 46.4m.
Final-quarter sales were Dollars 2.38bn, compared with Dollars 2.74bn.
Shawmut National, the US bank, is to acquire New Dartmouth Bank of
Manchester, New Hampshire, for about Dollars 143m in an exchange of stock,
agencies report.
The bank said that the deal was expected to increase its earnings per share
in the fourth quarter.
