Abortion opponents, backed by the Bush Administration, today urged the Supreme 
Court to overturn its landmark 1973 ruling giving women the right to terminate 
their pregnancies. The showdown spilled into the streets, where more than two 
dozen demonstrators were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States asks this court to reconsider and overrule its decision in 
Roe vs. Wade," said Harvard law professor Charles Fried, the former solicitor 
general who was asked to return to Administration service for this case. 
</P>
<P>
Fried was one of three lawyers participating in an hourlong argument over 
disputed Missouri abortion regulations, a case that has become a focal point 
for the emotionally charged battle over a woman's right to end her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not asking the court to unravel the fabric" of individual privacy 
rights, Fried told the justices. "We are asking the court to pull this one 
thread." 
</P>
<P>
But St. Louis lawyer Frank Susman, representing those who successfully 
challenged the restrictive Missouri regulations in lower courts, responded, 
"When I pull a thread, my sleeve falls off. There is no stopping. It is not a 
thread he's after." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Agonize' 
</P>
<P>
Susman urged the justices to uphold the 1973 ruling, stating, "Women do not 
make these decisions lightly. They agonize over them. . . . State legislatures 
have no business invading this decision." 
</P>
<P>
Missouri Atty. Gen. William Webster, defending the state's abortion 
regulations, said, "The government certainly is not obligated to become an 
advocate for abortion." 
</P>
<P>
He contended that lower courts were "clearly wrong" when they struck down a 
state legislative declaration that "life begins at conception." 
</P>
<P>
As the justices, with questions from the bench, probed the positions of each 
lawyer, the usually tranquil scene outside the court building offered an 
indication of how deeply public opinion runs on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of demonstrators -- with the pro-choice faction outnumbering the 
anti-abortion side by about 10 to 1 -- carried competing banners and placards 
that said, "Keep Abortion Legal," "Women Must Have the Right to Choose" and 
"Abortion Is Murder." There were 27 arrests on charges of unlawful entry for 
crossing police lines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'To See History' 
</P>
<P>
Some people arrived at the court as early as Tuesday afternoon hoping to get a 
prized seat inside for the arguments. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here to see history," said Jordy Green, a sophomore at Dartmouth College 
who arrived at 6 p.m. Tuesday to assure himself a courtroom seat. He said he is 
neutral on the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
The justices will take their initial private vote in the Missouri case Friday, 
discussing their views and beginning the process of drafting and redrafting 
opinions to accompany the announcement of the court's decision, expected by 
July. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to sway the justices, Americans in record numbers have been 
writing and telephoning the court to express their views. Tens of thousands of 
letters arrive each day, and the court's two switchboards were so flooded with 
calls that a rarely used third board had to be activated.
