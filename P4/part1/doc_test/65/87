A University of California vice-chancellor was on the phone the other day 
recruiting a $100,000 scholar. Once upon a simpler time, only professors in 
business schools, medical schools and law schools could command such major 
academic salaries -- along with chancellors, vice chancellors and deans. Not 
these days. Free-agent humanists, like free-agent shortstops, are demanding 
upper incomes, too. 
</P>
<P>
Philosophers now find themselves in bidding wars for wise men with big names -- 
the university equivalent of "Star Search." 
</P>
<P>
This might seem silly to CEO headhunters or agents for athletes and 
entertainers, since the upper ranges of academic salaries are still much less 
than a successful Vegas lounge act will draw, not to mention an arbitrager or a 
kid fresh out of law school. But the fact is, having joined the money game, 
institutions of higher education display a greater love of reputation than a 
love of learning. The values of the star system corrode the life of mind. 
</P>
<P>
Plato wrote in "Republic" that the pursuit of wisdom was incompatible with the 
pursuit of fortune and glory. Try telling that to today's marketable humanists. 
Plato thought the effort necessary for achieving understanding was 
all-consuming, as it is with earning money or politics. The consolation of 
philosophy was supposed to be the wisdom it brought, wisdom that made public 
reputation or private wealth pale by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
So it was no accident that the scholar's life had always been a modest one. 
Throughout the Middle Ages, most scholars never married. They were poor. The 
1950s college teacher who wore out his corduroys was respected because of what 
that shiny seat said about his dedication. In time, as salaries rose, college 
teachers joined the middle class -- often apologetically. 
</P>
<P>
All this has now changed. The consolation of the academic life in higher 
education is no longer as rewarding as higher compensation. Then, when the push 
for pay begins, the pursuit of wisdom turns into a scramble for reputation. The 
importance of the classroom, higher education's high purpose, fades. 
</P>
<P>
A six-figure scholar is not the sort to spend his time grading papers or 
correcting student grammar. He or she is likely to demand a teaching load of a 
couple of courses a year, maybe less. Most of the major players prefer to teach 
the same old thing, at least to undergraduates. A UCLA philosopher tells me 
that he prepares his lectures on the way to class. University professors are 
more like talking heads than the real teachers who do all those boring things 
like writing comments on term papers or keeping office hours. And students who 
once wrote 25-page papers now do five-page briefs -- so much easier to read. 
</P>
<P>
An eminent British philologist describes his teaching in America as being on 
sabbatical. 
</P>

Established scholars devote their time to research, where they spend more time 
writing than reading, because reading is too time-consuming. Scholars simply 
could not write as often as they do if they had time for reading, too. To read 
everything that's been written, on whatever topic, would leave no time to 
publish one's own views. Consequently, the new way to read a book is to scan a 
book review or else read a single chapter, for cocktail party understanding. 
Salary and reputation cannot wait for years of contemplation. Yet distinguished 
journals often have subscription lists of less than 500 institutions and 
individuals; the publishing runs of prestigious academic presses can be even 
smaller. Scholarly writing is now a form of advertising, more to sell the 
scholar than ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Since professors are reading less, as more is being written, those on the way 
to fame and richness must parlay academic reputations by cultivating the VIPs 
-- Very Important Professors. This self-appointed group of scholars, at the 
better schools, are the arbiters of academic appointments all across the 
nation. Their judgment is trusted by those who have never read their work, who 
only know their fine reputations. 
</P>
<P>
We have a self-fulfilling cycle: Important scholars are important because they 
are said to be important by important scholars. This is most true of 
interpretive academic disciplines that have no independent measure, where 
professors are the measure of all things, functioning like literary critics. 
There are, doubtlessly, exceptions, but a scientist at Cal Tech recently told 
me that this is even how the Nobel Prize is won. It could, of course, be sour 
grapes. Yet wisdom does not lend itself to lists. Scholarship is more of a 
collegial, communal effort -- at least it ought to be. 
</P>
<P>
None of this enhances public confidence in higher education or in the use of 
taxes that pay those fancy salaries -- or the tuitions people pay to put their 
kids through school. Private liberal arts colleges may still do a good 
classroom job because their support depends on a loyal, generous alumni. In the 
public sector, the quality of undergraduate instruction is too often 
compromised; educated students are far less important in the scheme of pay and 
perquisites than the esteem of peers. A well-known linguist, teaching at an 
Eastern college, recently turned down big bucks from the University of 
California because he found undergraduate instruction so appalling and the 
faculty so indifferent to instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Presidents of public universities claim that they have to pay to field a 
distinguished faculty. They must compete for scholars if the campus reputation 
is to thrive. Research universities focus on graduate programs, training 
grounds for the next generation of scholars and college teachers. Scholars with 
reputations are said to be necessities as drawing cards for students. But as 
the quality of undergraduate instruction fades, so does the product of graduate 
schools -- Ph.D. dissertations little better than Master's theses, not to 
mention students without values. I suspect public campuses and even graduate 
schools would do better with professors dedicated to the life of the open mind 
rather than the open market. 
</P>
<P>
The baseball analogy proves instructive. Before free agency reached 1980s 
frenzy, only a superstar could command a few million dollars. Now someone who 
hits .250 does. The same phenomenon, minus a couple of zeros, will repeat 
itself with academic salaries as those scholars of repute discover the rewards 
of speed on the career paths. But how to measure a free-agent scholar? Where 
are the stats for a heavy-hitting historian? A smooth-fielding philosopher? The 
pursuit of wisdom has no box score. 
</P>
<P>
Higher education is best approached from the bottom up, not top down, by 
providing decent wages and working conditions to grammar school teachers first. 
That's where the real work begins. Distributing money more diffusely would also 
help, emphasizing community colleges and four year schools, instead of pouring 
so much of the pot into elite universities and the favored few. 
</P>
<P>
Directors of foundations and dispensers of federal grants who share complaints 
about America's universities ought to reexamine how they distribute funds, 
whether they themselves have been playing the fame-fortune game. The money 
given out, with all the best intentions, may be partly to blame for the loss of 
values in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
The great American superstar may be a natural in left field but he doesn't have 
a key position in the lecture hall. Educators ought to be coaching students to 
write real papers for real teachers who will really read them. 
</P>
<P>
America has the best universities money can buy; that may be the problem.
