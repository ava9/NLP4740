Bentley on the dangers of a politically correct definition

Few modern plays have generated as much controversy as David Mamet's
Oleanna. It portrayed a disastrous series of miscommunications between a
male college professor and a female student which finally destroyed the
professor's career.
In a disturbing example of life mimicking art, a male college professor at
the University of New Hampshire is now on indefinite suspension without pay
following a sequence of events remarkably like those portrayed in Mamet's
play. The events raise important questions about academic freedom,
individual rights and 'political correctness'.
Donald Silva, 59, pillar of the local Congregational Church, and a faculty
member at the University of New Hampshire since 1972, taught a course on
technical writing. In one of his lectures, he compared an aspect of the
creative process to sex. The simile was based on the to and fro quality of
the movement and the sense of fulfilment that came at the end.
On another occasion, when discussing the use of similes, he suggested that
the movement of a belly dancer might be described as being 'like Jell-O on a
plate with a vibrator under the plate'. These sexual allusions offended some
of the female students who complained to the university authorities.
Was this all there was to it? Apparently, yes. In subsequent enquiries it
was reported that some female students felt the professor stood too close to
them on certain occasions, but there was no definition of how close was too
close.
An administrative tribunal nonetheless found Professor Silva guilty of
sexual harassment, defined in this case as 'creating a hostile and
intimidating atmosphere' in his class. The professor was suspended without
pay for a year, during which time he was required to undergo psychotherapy -
at his own expense - to correct his supposedly deviant tendencies.
He chose instead to bring legal action against the university, demanding
reinstatement to the faculty, compensation for lost income and undisclosed
damages. He thus remains suspended without pay pending the outcome of his
law suit.
The Silva case has split the University of New Hampshire community into
those who see it as a question of academic freedom and those who see it as a
question of women's rights. Both positions have merit and are defended
passionately: an unlikely basis for rational dialogue.
The university administration is understandably reticent about discussing
the case but Eve Goodman, head of the university's sexual harassment and
rape prevention programme, is prepared to comment. She says that if female
students felt afraid to go to a professor's lecture, then 'we got a problem
here'.
We certainly have. As an American academic, I feel a personal interest in
the Silva case, but its ramifications extend far beyond the confines of
American academia. Sexual harassment is becoming an increasingly important
issue throughout the developed world and definitions of what may or may not
constitute sexual harassment have profound implications for working
relationships in general.
With attempts to define the limits of acceptable behaviour comes the image
of a society dominated by politically-correct thought police.
While such a prospect may be interesting as a dramatic premise, does it have
any basis in reality? In the light of events at the University of New
Hampshire, I am less complacent than I was. In my day-to-day dealings with
students, I find myself increasingly aware that even the perception of
'inappropriateness' could be disastrous. This is especially true with female
students, in whose company I now feel a level of personal vulnerability more
appropriate to a minefield than a classroom.
This is not paranoia. Official guidelines in most private and governmental
organisations in the US include 'creation of a hostile and intimidating
atmosphere' under the general heading of sexual harassment.
The Silva case shows clearly that even casual references to personal bodily
functions - especially those pertaining to reproduction - may be deemed to
create such an atmosphere, constituting grounds for censure. This censure
carries the same stigma as a conviction for indecent assault.
The question of stigma is crucial to this debate. What is important in the
Silva case is not what he was accused of but what he was not accused of.
There was no suggestion, for example, of improved grades in exchange for
sexual favours. No mention of groping, fondling or even 'inappropriate
touching'.
And if his similes generated an environment that his accusers found 'hostile
and intimidating', where might these women feel comfortable? Surely not on
the campus of a modern university, where ideas are expressed freely -
sometimes even offensively - and established opinions are open to constant
challenge. Most important of all: is the academic equivalent of a death
sentence reasonable punishment for the 'crime' of using sexually-suggestive
similes?
It is now up to the courts to decide. Meanwhile, I am reminded of a song,
extolling the politically-incorrect delights of 'standing on the corner
watching all the girls go by'. I remember particularly the line that goes
'you can't go to jail for what you're thinking'. Such optimism may soon be
out of date.
