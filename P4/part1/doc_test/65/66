HALIFAX, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A summer storm came swirling down, churning up leaves on the sidewalks and 
sending umbrellas tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
As sheets of rain obstructed the view, we sought shelter in the nearest 
building -- Halifax's central post office. There, a friendly security guard 
greeted all the familiar, wet faces passing through the stamp counters. He 
spotted us immediately; two unfamiliar faces glancing around. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello, you," he called out. "You must look at the mosaic under your feet of 
the famous Bluenose racing schooner." 
</P>
<P>
Stepping back, we gazed at the blue-and-gold tiles designed in the shape of the 
sleek yacht, which until then seemed nothing more than fashionable artwork. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see the replica of the original schooner moored at the Privateers' 
Wharf," the guard said proudly. "It's only a block away." 
</P>
<P>
Such is street life in Halifax, one of Canada's quaint, out-of-the-way 
provincial capitals. 
</P>
<P>
The warmth and friendliness of Nova Scotia is not lost here, but in a province 
known more for its craggy shoreline and hideaway inlets, Halifax is a haven for 
maritime history buffs. 
</P>
<P>
Nestled on a peninsula that forms a large natural harbor, Halifax is an 
ice-free port that is navigable year-round. As a result, the city is steeped in 
maritime marvels, not the least being the famous Bluenose. 
</P>
<P>
While walking along the renovated dock, we found the impressive Bluenose II 
resting peacefully in its berth. The 143-foot, two-masted schooner is a replica 
of the original built in 1921. The Bluenose plied the seas as a fishing ship, 
but her sleek design helped her win many international races. 
</P>
<P>
She was undefeated in 20 years of racing, and as a tribute, she was featured on 
a Canadian 10-cent silver coin. In 1946, the yacht met misfortune and sank off 
Haiti. The Halifax Herald proclaimed: "Her passing is a national sorrow; the 
ignominy of her death, a national shame." 
</P>
<P>
A replica of the Bluenose II was launched in 1963 and is permanently moored 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Life in Halifax begins at the wharf, a conglomeration of refurbished 
wood-and-stone buildings dating from 1800 to 1905. A waterfront boardwalk 
provides easy access to the many shops in the Historic Properties section. 
</P>
<P>
This is Halifax's original settlement, where pirates brought their cargo to 
peddle and store. Many of the buildings have been converted into tourist shops, 
boutiques, cafes, pubs and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The Old Red Store, once used for shipping operations with its hipped roof and 
large hoistway dormers, is now the Nova Scotia Tourist Center. The center has a 
wide selection of books from Nova Scotian authors, who bring the province's 
history of French and English pioneers to life. 
</P>
<P>
Halifax's city tourist bureau is downtown, at the corner of Duke and Barrington 
streets. Free city maps are offered in front of the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Halifax was first settled in 1749, when the British -- some 2,500 strong -- 
founded a military base here. The Halifax harbor was used as a British naval 
base during the American Revolution and the War of 1812. During both world 
wars, Halifax was a major supply center for ships heading to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Life in Halifax begins at the wharf, a conglomeration of refurbished 
wood-and-stone buildings dating from 1800 to 1905. A waterfront boardwalk 
provides easy access to the many shops in the Historic Properties section. 
</P>
<P>
In 1917, the biggest man-made explosion before the atomic bomb occurred when a 
French munitions ship, the Mont Blanc, carrying 4,000 tons of TNT, collided 
with the Imo in the harbor. Half of Halifax was laid to ruins and a reported 
2,000 died from the blast. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city has never come under attack, it has not lost its military 
presence, with the majestic old compound on Citadel Hill standing over Halifax 
like a great protective wall. 
</P>
<P>
The Citadel's landmark is the Old Town Clock, which sits in stately fashion on 
an emerald green hillside in front of the fort. 
</P>
<P>
The clock, shipped from England in 1803, was designed by the garrison 
commander, the Duke of Kent. It still chimes the correct time, the bells 
echoing across the city. 
</P>
<P>
The star-shaped garrison of Citadel Hill was constructed between 1829 and 1861, 
and is the fourth fortress built on the site. The fort is open free to the 
public from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. during the summer, and from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from 
September to June. 
</P>
<P>
Guided tours, lasting about three quarters of an hour, are given by Canadian 
park rangers, who offer detailed accounts of the fort's past. 
</P>
<P>
A highlight of the tour is the ceremonial changing of the guards and a 
traditional gun salute, as well as the playing of bagpipes by members of the 
Scottish Highlanders. 
</P>
<P>
Views from the fort's highest points are spectacular when looking across the 
harbor to Halifax's sister city of Dartmouth. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown, St. Paul's Church -- constructed in 1750 -- is said to be Canada's 
oldest Anglican church. St. Paul's epitomizes the British influence here. 
Whereas Quebec City feels as French as a boulangerie, Halifax is as English as 
tea and crumpets. 
</P>
<P>
Especially during a rainstorm. 
</P>
<P>
The best months to visit Halifax are June through October, when temperatures 
are mild. July and August are the warmest months, but September and October 
offer spectacular scenes of changing foliage. 
</P>
<P>
Halifax is host this year to the World Ice Skating Championships March 5-12 at 
the downtown Metro Center. The event is the sport's premier competition outside 
of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Summer tourists can enjoy two major events -- Festival '90 and the 
International Buskers Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Festival '90 -- a celebration of Halifax's birthday -- runs from July 27 to 
Aug. 6. Activities include fireworks shows, an Irish dance festival, a jazz 
festival, an international town cryer competition and a beach party. 
</P>
<P>
The Buskers competition, from Aug. 9-18, features street performers such as 
jugglers, puppeteers and magicians who ply their trade day and night along city 
streets. Spectators select their favorite act at the week's end. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended accommodations: 
</P>

breakfast inn in the back. 
</P>
<P>

The hotel's breakfast is worth a special note; it's as good as any we found in 
the Maritimes. Call (902) 423-8614.

inexpensive ferry service that has been operating since the 1750s.

As for food, Halifax offers international fare, though seafood is its 
specialty. Both the city center and Historic Properties section have a number 
of fine restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Halifax also has one of the finest pub districts in Canada. Most of the 50 pubs 
serve hearty food at modest prices in the early evening. The pubs, which 
resemble some of London's finest, are concentrated along Argyle Street in 
downtown or in the Historic Properties section. Most are restored 19th-Century 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Halifax has an international airport about 25 miles northwest of the city, 
along Route 102. Air Canada is the only carrier servicing Los Angeles to 
Halifax daily. All flights have stopovers in Montreal or Toronto. Round-trip 
fares are about $465 plus tax. For more information, call toll-free (800) 
424-3687. 
</P>
<P>
Bus service in the city is good, but visitors should have access to a car to 
drive through the spectacular countryside. 
</P>
