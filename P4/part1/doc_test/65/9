Alabama has struggled this season, but Saturday against Penn State the Crimson 
Tide might have hit rock bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Fayak kicked three field goals for Penn State as the Nittany Lions beat 
Alabama, 9-0, at Tuscaloosa, Ala. -- the Crimson Tide's first shutout defeat at 
home in 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State (5-2) held the Crimson Tide (3-4) to 141 yards, including only six 
on the ground, as the teams ended a 10-game series in which Alabama won six. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State was the first team to shut out Alabama at Bryant-Denny Stadium since 
1955, when TCU won, 21-0. The six yards rushing is an all-time low for the 
Tide. The previous low was 11 yards in a 27-7 loss to Tulane in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama, which has gone 11 quarters without scoring a touchdown, lost its only 
scoring opportunity when Philip Doyle missed a 43-yard field-goal attempt in 
the first quarter after Fayak had given Penn State a 3-0 lead with a 34-yard 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse 26, Army 14 -- David Walker scored on a three-yard run and Mark 
McDonald connected with Rob Carpenter on a 43-yard touchdown pass play as the 
Orangemen (4-2-2) came from behind to beat the Cadets (3-4) at West Point, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, who completed 17 of 22 passes for 229 yards, drove the Orangemen 80 
yards to set up Walker's touchdown run with 7:47 left, giving Syracuse a 14-13 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Mayweather, Army's all-time leading rusher, carried 32 times for 131 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Boston College 27, West Virginia 14 -- Kevin Pearson returned an interception 
31 yards for a touchdown and the Eagles (4-3) converted three other Mountaineer 
turnovers into scores in a nonconference game at Morgantown, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the game, West Virginia (3-4) had forced 18 turnovers and surrendered 
the ball four times -- the best turnover ratio in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Rutgers 20, Akron 17 -- Shaun Smith intercepted a pass in the end zone with 36 
seconds left to preserve the victory for the Scarlet Knights (3-5) at 
Piscataway, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Akron (3-5-1) had driven from its own 29 to the Rutgers' nine, but quarterback 
Wayne Wade's pass intended for Marcus Reliford was picked off by Smith. 
</P>
<P>
James Madison 16, Navy 7 -- The Dukes (5-3) sacked Navy quarterback Alton 
Grizzard seven times to take command of the Midshipmen (3-4) at Annapolis, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Senior fullback Willie Lanier gained only nine yards, but scored on two 
two-yard touchdown runs for the Dukes. 
</P>
<P>
Temple 30, East Carolina 27 -- Bob Wright kicked a 24-yard field goal with 1:16 
left to help the Owls (4-3) overcome two touchdown runs by Dion Johnson and 
defeat the Pirates (3-6) at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson returned a punt 53 yards for a touchdown and had a 90-yard kickoff 
return for a touchdown -- both in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Dartmouth 17, Harvard 0 -- Shon Page rushed for a school-record 222 yards and 
scored two touchdowns to lead the Big Green to an Ivy League victory over the 
Crimson at Hanover, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
Page, who scored on a 49-yard run in the first quarter and a 29-yard run midway 
through the second quarter, broke David Clark's school record of 219 yards set 
against Penn last year. 
</P>
<P>
Dartmouth, 4-2-1 overall and 3-1 in the Ivy League, shut out Harvard (4-3, 2-2) 
for the first time since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia 17, Princeton 15 -- Bruce Mayhew passed for one touchdown and scored

Yale 27, Pennsylvania 10 -- Darin Kehler passed for 128 yards and rushed for 69

</P>
<P>
Cornell 34, Brown 7 -- Linebacker Mark Broderick broke a 43-year-old school
