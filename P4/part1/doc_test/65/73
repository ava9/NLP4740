Although he taught high school math and science for 25 years, Joseph Hudock, 
75, always yearned to be an artist. After he retired from teaching, he finally 
fulfilled his dream and took up oil painting, drawing and lithography -- just 
for starters. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Bruce Crozat, 38, who has held a variety of jobs, never 
thought about being a professional photographer until he received a camera as a 
gift five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Today both men, along with 25 other Santa Monica College students, are involved 
in the SMC Arts Mentor Program, and both are busily preparing for upcoming 
exhibits of their works this summer. The present show at the college Art 
Gallery -- sculptures, drawings and paintings by Janet Kessler and an 
installation by James Linza featuring three-dimensional objects, paintings, 
music and smell -- runs through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Randal Lawson, dean of arts, the program is unique within the 
California community college system. It matches top students from nine 
categories -- art, architecture, photography, interior design, fashion design, 
graphic design, music, theater and dance -- with instructors or professionals 
in those fields for one-on-one counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Crozat works closely with SMC photography instructor Larry Jones, who provides 
him with advice during weekly meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"Bruce is one of our better success stories," Jones said. "I've watched him go 
through a series of changes over the years and now he's a slick product 
photographer. 
</P>
<P>
"With this program and his exhibit, he has a chance to put his name out there. 
Unless you're a fine art-oriented photographer, galleries won't show your work, 
so this is a way to showcase our top photography students." 
</P>
<P>
Said Crozat: "I've made a lot of progress in my mentor year in terms of 
refinement of work. I've expanded artistically. I've gone from doing mostly 
commercial product shots to doing art, design and still-life shots, too. This 
program prepares you for a professional career because everything has to be 
perfect. You know you're having a show so you put forth your best effort." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hudock: "I'm always experimenting with art and I've expanded even more 
since I've been in the program. My mentor, Dan Freeman, has a way of knowing if 
I'm progressing or not, and he gives me literature about the newest ideas in 
art. The program is doing a lot for all the students. You can tell by their 
shows. The expression in the art is different from what you'd get in an 
ordinary classroom situation." 
</P>
<P>
The mentor program was created by members of the SMC Professional Arts 
Committee in 1986 to provide individual instruction each semester for 25 to 30 
students "who are beyond the level of classes we offer in different 
disciplines," Lawson said. "Other community colleges offer private instruction, 
but I think we're the only one that requires an audition or portfolio review 
for entry and covers so many arts areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Each department has set up its own selection criteria and review process, 
under an umbrella of certain college-wide qualifications. In some cases, there 
are certain courses students need to have taken prior to being admitted. It 
wasn't at all difficult to set up this program, and there's been a lot of 
interest in it from all over the country." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson noted that while many mentor teachers are SMC faculty members, sometimes 
experts from the outside arts community are paired with students, which leads 
to expanded involvement for the mentors. 
</P>
<P>
"Professionals who have joined our program become a part of the department," he 
said. "They come to student juries, and many of them have recitals, 
performances or shows of their work on campus." (Past mentors have included 
members of the L.A. Philharmonic and the Sequoia String Quartet.) 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five students have been through the program since its inception, which 
allows them one to four semesters of involvement, with evaluation of their work 
required at the end of each semester. As for results, Lawson said: "As far as I 
know, all the students who have completed the program have gone on to do what 
they expected to do -- transfer to a four-year school, institute of arts or 
music conservatory or just to begin working in the profession." 
</P>
<P>
Glass blower Jeremy Cline, 24, has his goals planned. "This program has helped 
me get serious about art and prepare for the real world," he said. "In the fall 
I'm transferring to the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland and I 
may get" a master's degree in fine arts "so I can teach. Eventually I want to 
have my own studio and do fine art. 
</P>
<P>
"I work well with my mentor, Don Hartman, and I've learned how to stick with a 
problem and go all the way through the process," Cline said. "Often when you're 
doing art, you're too close to it to see it clearly. It's good to have someone 
else look at a project and open your eyes about it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hartman: "I try to let his ideas be his ideas and not change them. It's 
been stimulating for me to watch his work improve. It's an exciting program for 
a school like this, where most of the faculty are too busy to work individually 
with gifted students." 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Tina Blokh, 28, has literally traveled a long road to pursue her dream 
of becoming a concert performer and teacher. In an ironic twist of 
happenstance, she was matched with a mentor, USC instructor Konstantin 
Sirounian, who is from her home town, Tbilisi, in the Soviet state of Georgia 
-- a man unknown to her until she began the mentor program. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a professor from Moscow University and a wonderful teacher," she said. "I 
work with him at USC and I plan to get my master's degree there." 
</P>
<P>
Dance student Penny King, 40, has also traveled a long road from her childhood 
experience with Pacific Theater Ballet in Santa Monica to years of professional 
dance in Oregon, back to Santa Monica to study choreography with Linda Gold, 
coordinator of the SMC dance program. 
</P>
<P>
"I've found just what I needed here, and I'm blown away by my mentor," she 
said. "I thought this would be a nice little class on 'how to structure a 
dance,' but I didn't expect to have the opportunity to create in such a 
supportive atmosphere. Linda helps me clarify and whittle away excess movement, 
and I'm making a lot of progress with her." 
</P>
<P>
Gold is enthusiastic about the program. "It's an effective, self-directed 
teaching approach and with the extra time and attention given, the amount of 
progress that can happen is remarkable. The students become more independent 
artists. You can go to a different level with them, and that kind of evolving 
sophistication has been exciting to see. The students gain and so does the 
community because these are the artists who are serious, who want a chance and 
are willing to work for it." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson believes that the mentor program benefits more than SMC students. "It's 
brought new life to school departments and programs," he said. "And we've had a 
number of special art showings, concerts and performances that have resulted 
from it. Now we're working to better organize presentations and let the public 
know about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming shows include the work of Bruce Crozat (Friday to July 28), Santa 
Monica College Photography Gallery (Library Foyer), 1900 Pico Blvd., and Jeremy 
Cline and Joseph Hudock (July 7 to 21), Art Gallery, 1900 Pico Blvd.
