CRITICISM OF SDSU IMPERIAL VALLEY CAMPUS MAY BRING CHANGES 
</P>

A critical outside review of academic offerings and the physical plant at the 
Imperial Valley campus of San Diego State University will result in a 
reappraisal of the direction the Calexico facility should take and what 
additional state funding might be required. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU educators agreed this week with the sharp criticisms made last spring by 
the Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges that said the satellite campus offers 
too many courses with too few professors, has dilapidated buildings with 
peeling paint and poor acoustics, and an inadequate library to support its 
class offerings. The university commented publicly on the WASC findings for the 
first time this week. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Johnson, SDSU vice president for academic affairs, said many of the 
shortcomings were cited in an internal May, 1988, report by San Diego State 
educators trying to get a handle on problems in the Imperial Valley, which he 
called a "one of a kind" arrangement in the state. San Diego State is the only 
Cal State university with satellite campuses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Established in 1960 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said a special committee of San Diego State and California State 
University officials will look at short- and long-range ideas to improve the 
campus, which was established in 1960 to offer upper-division undergraduate 
courses and graduate courses in teacher education. Those recommendations could 
include closer ties with Imperial Community College, the region's only other 
post-secondary institution, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The dean of the Imperial Valley campus, David Ballesteros, said, "What needs to 
be emphasized is that we are part of the state of California, even though we 
happen to be along the border and have a large Hispanic population, and 
therefore we deserve the best in education just like everywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
The campus today offers nine undergraduate majors and a graduate degree in 
educational administration, with 21 full-time professors for 420 students, 
about 60% undergraduate, 73% women and 53% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the campus' small size -- San Diego State's main campus has 35,000 
students and its upper-division North County center 2,000 students -- it has 
found itself with several academic departments having only one full-time 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland-based WASC, which accredits universities in the West, said the tiny 
departments mean that students cannot receive the necessary depth in a 
particular field. In response, the university is attempting to merge department 
offerings into several interdisciplinary majors such as social studies or 
general humanities. In that manner, the school can offer thematic courses that 
draw upon a historian, a sociologist, a political scientist or an economist -- 
in contrast to a specific major such as economics, which would require several 
professors in the field to cover the courses necessary for the specialized 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stronger Curriculum 
</P>
<P>
"I think that is a realistic restructuring" to meet some of the concerns of the 
WASC, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Weiner, WASC executive director for university accrediting, agreed that a 
broader interdisciplinary offerings could result in a stronger curriculum 
without having to add substantially to the faculty. The WASC will review 
progress in three years. 
</P>
<P>
But Ballesteros cautioned that too few majors may cause problems with state 
requirements that teachers planning to work in secondary schools have academic 
majors in specific fields rather than across disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
And he said the larger issue is how to make the campus attractive to more 
students -- many of whom do not want to leave the valley -- by offering more 
majors and graduate degrees in subjects related to the growing binational ties 
between Mexicali and the Imperial Valley. Ballesteros suggested criminal 
justice, business, public administration and health as potential new 
disciplines that could meet valley needs. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are probably the four areas that are saleable in the valley," he said. 
"I don't think we're going to be able to propose a general (four-year) liberal 
arts/science curriculum" in the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros said "all of this comes down to money, staffing commitment and good 
will -- which goes beyond just San Diego State. . . . We have to interpret our 
needs" better to the CSU chancellor's office and to state legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that historically, there has been little or no pressure from the 
valley community for a greater share of resources, with the result that the 
number of high school students who attend either a Cal State or University of 
California campus is less than half the lowest figures in counties elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 4,000 students attend Imperial Valley Community College, but most take 
vocational courses and do not transfer to four-year institutions, Johnson said.
