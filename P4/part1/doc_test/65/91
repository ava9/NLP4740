Say "Chapman University." It doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. 
</P>
<P>
But if Chapman College President Allen E. Koenig has his way, the school will 
have a new name by 1992. And it is only one of the changes in store for the 
shady campus in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman College, a private, four-year, Christian institution of 2,200 students, 
boasts a 130-year history, small classes and an ecumenical sense of morality 
that pervades its curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig, the school's 11th president, created a stir on the quiet campus when he 
came to Chapman in October, 1989, after a decade as president of Boston's 
Emerson College. He left the East Coast as a controversial, pro-growth 
president criticized for his efforts to move the school from its urban home and 
arrived at Chapman with a long list of plans to expand and improve academic 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Some at Chapman worried that Koenig's goal to make the school a "medium-sized 
university" would lower the quality of education, with classes taught by 
professors who spent more time in the research lab than the classroom. Off 
campus, residents of the surrounding neighborhood feared that the school's 
growth would encroach on Old Towne, Orange's historical district. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig says Chapman is already a university in everything but name, and while 
he hopes the student body will grow to 3,000 in the next decade, he assures 
critics that growth will be gradual. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't consider us to be small now," Koenig said recently. "That is a 
stereotype perpetuated (by the media). We're really like a smaller university 
or perhaps a medium-sized university." 
</P>
<P>
The name change would be a way to "emphasize that we are small enough to be 
personal but large enough to be interesting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig also believes a new name could help enrollment and will recommend the 
change to the Board of Trustees, but he said that if he does not have sweeping 
support, he will drop the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he has implemented other, more substantive changes. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 administrative positions were cut or reorganized this summer so 
that funds could be freed to establish a center for ethics and values and a 
center for international studies. The school's Center for Economic Research is 
nationally recognized. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the faculty approved a new general-education curriculum that 
emphasizes "education for the global citizen." 
</P>
<P>
This month, groundbreaking took place for a new dorm, and construction of a 
student/faculty center is scheduled to begin in July. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, community leaders have fought construction at the college. They 
are protective of the area's early 20th-Century architecture and say Chapman 
has not included them in planning expansion of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
But Carole Walters, a community leader in the Chapman neighborhood, said 
working with the Koenig administration has been "like night and day." MARY
