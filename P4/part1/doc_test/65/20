PAUL AMADEUS PISK; 'MAN OF MUSIC,' SCHOENBERG PROTEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the last surviving students of renowned Austrian composer Arnold 
Schoenberg and Austrian musicologist Guido Adler has died at the age of 96. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Amadeus Pisk, an Austrian-American composer, pedagogue and musicologist, 
died at his Hollywood home late Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
With Pisk was his 71-year-old caretaker of nine years, Anna May Payne. 
</P>
<P>
Payne, who called Pisk "Papa," said: "What the world has lost is a great, 
wonderful man of music." A recurring back injury had left Pisk bedridden for 
the last 13 months, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Vienna in 1893, Pisk had been an accomplished pianist, composer, 
teacher and music critic for a newspaper before immigrating to the United 
States in 1936. Once here, Pisk taught at Dartmouth College, Washington 
University in St. Louis, University of Redlands, University of Texas at Austin, 
USC, UCLA and the University of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pisk's musical style, characterized by some experts as 
neo-renaissance, was not as popular as Schoenberg's, it was unique and widely 
respected by music scholars, said Dr. Ellis Kohs, a friend and colleague from 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his compositions, Pisk wrote numerous books and articles on 
music, said Nicolas Slonimsky, a friend and colleague of Pisk's. A founding 
member of the International Society for Contemporary Music, Pisk also belonged 
to the American Musicological Society, said Leonard Stein, director of the 
Arnold Schoenberg Institute at USC. 
</P>
<P>
A tribute concert of his work was held at Cal State Northridge on Pisk's 90th 
birthday, and the Schoenberg Institute at USC made Pisk an honorary life 
member, Stein said. Later this spring, Stein said, a concert will be held in 
Pisk's memory. 
</P>
<P>
Pisk is survived by a son, George, 55, of Austin, Tex.
