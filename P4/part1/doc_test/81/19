  [Text] Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Al 
Thani arrived in Amman this afternoon on a two-day visit to 
Jordan, during which he will hold talks on bolstering bilateral 
relations and the Arab situation. 
  On a statement to reporters on arrival, the Qatari minister 
said: 
  [Begin recording] [Al Thani] In the name of God, the 
merciful, the compassionate. I am grateful for the warm 
reception by the brothers in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. 
Of course, the visit comes within the framework of the 
long-standing fraternal bilateral relations. Today's visit aims 
to bolster this position, and if there is any misunderstanding 
or anything else to place things in a sound framework--a 
framework of brotherhood and cooperation, and within the 
framework of realizing Arab solidarity [sentence incomplete as 
heard]. 
  [Reporter] Your Excellency the Minister, what is the State 
of 
Qatar's view on Arab solidarity? 
  [Al Thani] We have stated several times that Arab solidarity 
is a necessity. If there is something to be discussed, in my 
view we can discuss it face to face as Arabs, and there is no 
need for estrangement. We should speak face to face and put 
things on the right track. 
  [Reporter] Are you carrying a message to his majesty the 
king 
from his highness the amir? 
  [Al Thani] Of course, I will convey the greetings of his 
highness the amir and his highness the heir apparent to his 
majesty the king and His Highness Prince Hasan. At the same 
time, I will convey a verbal message. 
  [Reporter] Your Excellency, would you sum up Qatar's 
position 
on the peace process, especially concerning holy Jerusalem? 
  [Al Thani] Since the very beginning of this problem with the 
Israeli occupation of Palestine, the State of Qatar has been 
adopting a clear position. Qatar supports the brothers, whether 
in Palestine or other Arab countries that were harmed by the 
[Israeli] occupation in 1967. We support the Palestinian 
people's peace understanding which they reached with Israel. It 
is a Palestinian affair, and we only support the brothers, 
whether in peace or in other conditions--we support them with 
the capabilities available to us. 
  [Reporter] What about holy Jerusalem? 
  [Al Thani] Of course, this is the first of the two qiblas, 
and it is important to us as Muslims. We do not want to see 
Jerusalem remain in non-Islamic or non-Arab hands. [end 
recording] 
  For his part, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for 
foreign affairs, said: 
  [Begin al-Hasan recording] I would like to point out the 
good 
and fraternal relations between Jordan and Qatar. These 
relations are long-standing and are developing, praise be to 
God. His Majesty King Husayn and his brother His Highness 
Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani have been eager to bolster 
these relations in various fields and on various levels. 
Undoubtedly, the visit of my brother and friend Qatari Foreign 
Minister Shaykh Hamad Al Thani to his country and kinsfolk in 
Jordan will bolster and develop these relations. The visit will 
surely lead to a qualitative shift concerning the implementation 
of all agreements and protocols annexed to them, which 
undoubtedly will foster fraternal relations. This is not 
restricted to the bilateral field. The visit of his excellency 
the minister will constitute a shift toward bolstering Arab 
ranks and Arab solidarity, which we hope to be in its best 
shape, God willing. [end recording]
