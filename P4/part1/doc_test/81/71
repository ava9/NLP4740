  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina Gonzalez 
concluded an official visit to Qatar on 6 June. The head of 
Cuban diplomacy said in the Qatari capital that the Qatari 
Government decided to establish diplomatic relations with Cuba 
despite foreign pressure. Robaina said that during his visit to 
the Persian Gulf country, negotiations were started for 
cooperation in the health, sports, biology, and medicine sectors. 
  Shortly before stating this in a news conference at Doha, 
Robaina met with Defense Minister Prince Hamad Bin-Khalifah Al 
Thani, to whom he delivered a letter from Cuban President Fidel 
Castro Ruz. The Qatari leader said his government wants to 
maintain independent relations with Cuba based on respect for 
sovereignty. Al Thani also accepted Robaina's invitation to 
visit Havana, adding that he will sponsor the visit of a 
delegation of Qatari businessmen to Havana. 
  Robaina also met with the ministers of foreign affairs, 
health, economy, finance, and trade to analyze the possibilities 
of bilateral cooperation.
