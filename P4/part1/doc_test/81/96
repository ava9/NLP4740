  [Text] Cairo, March 26 (AFP) -- Arab countries oppose 
efforts by Oman and Qatar to end a boycott on firms doing 
business with Israel, a diplomat close to the Arab League said 
Saturday [26 March]. 
  The two Gulf oil states recently began "intensive efforts" 
to 
ease the embargo, but "this campaign did not win the approval" 
of other Arab countries because of the February 25 Hebron 
massacre, the diplomat told AFP. 
  "All the other Arab countries want to maintain the indirect 
boycott" affecting companies dealing with Israel, the diplomat 
said on condition his name not be used. 
  Diplomats, who had expected the Arab League to agree to lift 
the indirect boycott, said Saturday the "climate was not 
favorable" because of the massacre of 30 Palestinians by a 
Jewish settler in the West Bank town of Hebron. 
  The United States had called on Arab states to ease their 
46-year-old trade boycott of Israel in recognition of the accord 
on Palestinian self-rule signed in September. 
  But Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said on arrival 
in 
Cairo for the Arab League meeting: "The boycott of Israel was 
decided because of its occupation of Arab lands. 
  "It cannot be lifted before Israel withdraws totally from 
occupied Arab territories and the Palestinians create their own 
state," al-Shar' said. 
  Syria made no distinction between the direct boycott of 
Israel and the indirect boycott, al-Shar' said. Apart from "one 
or two countries," other Arab states had the same view, he added. 
  Two-thirds of the Arab League's 22 members would have to 
support such a move if it came to a vote. 
  Since the Israeli-PLO accord was signed on September 13, 
Washington has called for the indirect boycott to be lifted in 
exchange for US participation in developing the Gaza Strip and 
West Bank town of Jericho where autonomy is to be launched. 
  Arab countries have boycotted Israel since it was created in 
1948. Three years later, they set up a body in charge of 
drawing up a "black list" of international firms with interests 
in Israel. 
  Apart from Egypt, which made peace with Israel in 1979, only 
Kuwait has lifted the indirect boycott, last year. 
  Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Al Thani met 
in London in January with Israeli counterpart Shim'on Peres and 
called for a lifting of the boycott. 
  Oman has invited Israel to attend a multilateral meeting on 
Middle East water resources on April 17 -- the first such move 
by a Gulf country.
