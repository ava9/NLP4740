  [Text] Cairo, 27 Mar (INA)--Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad 
Bin-Jasim Al Thani has reiterated his country's firm stand on 
the need to lift the embargo imposed on the people of Iraq. 
Speaking to reporters in Cairo today on the sidelines of the 
Arab League Council meeting, the Qatari foreign minister said 
that relations with Iraq are going well and are continuously 
developing in the interest of the Iraqi and Qatari peoples and 
the Arab nation. 
  Answering a question by an INA correspondent in Cairo on 
Qatar's stand vis-a-vis the attempts to prolong the embargo 
imposed on Iraq, the Qatari foreign minister said that Qatar is 
working toward ending the suffering of the Iraqi people as soon 
as possible because we cannot remain silent about the effects of 
the sanctions, adding that it is in the interest of the nation 
to end this situation. 
  The Qatari minister said that he met with [Iraqi] Foreign 
Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf and discussed with him issues 
related to lifting the blockade imposed on the people of Iraq, 
noting that Iraqi-Qatari relations have never ceased. 
  The Qatari minister said that Qatar is playing an Arab role 
to bring closer the viewpoints of the Arab parties and brothers 
everywhere in the interest of the nation's solidarity and 
strength.
