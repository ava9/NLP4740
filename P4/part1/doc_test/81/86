  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Damascus Declaration 
foreign ministers held a closed meeting this morning, during 
which they continued their discussion of the topics listed on 
the agenda. 
  In a statement to reporters this morning, Foreign Minister 
Faruq al-Shar' said: We are satisfied with the deliberations 
taking place among the foreign ministers of the Damascus 
Declaration states. The ministers expressed interest in the 
declaration and the need to activate it and implement its 
provisions in the various domains, particularly the political 
and economic ones. Moreover, all the ministers expressed a 
great deal of interest in the anticipated summit between 
Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. Al-Shar' stressed 
that the anticipated summit is very important, as admitted by 
several countries and nations in the region. Al-Shar' said: We 
look forward with optimism to the summit meeting in order to 
achieve results and successes that would help establish a just 
and comprehensive peace in the region on the basis of the 
resolutions of international legitimacy and the land-for-peace 
principle. He added: The topics the two presidents will 
discuss in Geneva are the peace process and the way to achieve a 
just and comprehensive peace, in addition to bilateral 
relations. An extensive discussion will be held on the overall 
situation in the region. 
  In a statement to reporters today, Egyptian Foreign Minister 
'Amr Musa stressed the need to implement the Damascus 
Declaration provisions, indicating that the current meeting of 
the declaration states' foreign ministers will boost the Syrian 
position on the restoration of the Golan. He called for seeking 
the best ways and means to serve the Arab economic situation. 
Musa paid tribute to the fraternal relations between Syria and 
Egypt and described them as strong. He said: Bilateral 
coordination exists and continues. 
  Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin Jabr Al Thani 
said the Damascus Declaration is not a bloc disconnected with 
the Arab League, but a group of principles agreed on by the 
eight states to provide an appropriate atmosphere for joint 
cooperation under all circumstances. In a radio statement 
today, Shaykh Hamad said he hoped that the Damascus Declaration 
will continue to exist and serve as a model for the other Arab 
states. The Qatari minister said that it is joint interests 
that determine cooperation among states. Hence, he said, the 
Damascus Declaration was ratified. He stressed his country's 
commitment to the joint Arab action regarding the Arab boycott 
of Israel.
