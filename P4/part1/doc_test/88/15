The far-right British National party, which won its first local authority
seat in a by-election at Tower Hamlets in September, will contest eight
seats in the east London borough in next month's council elections.
Tower Hamlets has the most decentralised structure of any local authority in
Britain - it is divided into seven largely autonomous neighbourhoods. BNP
candidates are concentrated in two of the seven - Isle of Dogs and Globe
Town.
The party's September by-election success was in the Isle of Dogs, where it
appears to have successfully exploited concerns about housing among the
predominantly white population. BNP activists have campaigned hard in the
area to consolidate their position.
The divisions and recriminations in the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties,
which hold all other seats on the council, are illustrated in yesterday's
nominations.
Mr James Hunt, the Labour by-election candidate who resigned from the party
after losing the seat to the BNP, is standing in the Isle of Dogs as an
independent.
Mr Jeremy Shaw, who resigned from the Liberal Democrats during an inquiry by
the national party which found that some Tower Hamlets' Liberal Democrat
leaflets had pandered to racism, is one of several independent Liberals
standing against official Liberal Democrat candidates.
At Westminster Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrat campaign chairman,
acknowledged that the independent Liberal Democrats might split the party's
vote in Tower Hamlets, David Owen writes. But he predicted the party would
keep control of the council.
If people did not agree with the way the party had handled things, they
should leave it, Mr Taylor said.
The 'overriding priority' in Tower Hamlets must be to stop the BNP from
getting elected, he added.
