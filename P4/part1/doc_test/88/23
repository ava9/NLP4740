Conservatives suffered unprecedented setbacks in London last night as both
Labour and the Liberal Democrats won control of a series of councils, many
of which were previously thought impregnable.
The most wounding results were in the suburbs, with the Conservatives losing
overall control of Bexley, Harrow, and Redbridge. They also came within one
seat of doing so in Bromley. Labour also came within one seat of taking
control of Havering, which was previously hung.
Labour took control of Ealing, Enfield, Croydon and Hillingdon (which had
already fallen in a by-election) from the Conservatives, while the Liberal
Democrats enjoyed their strongest ever showing in the capital, seizing
Kingston upon Thames and making double-figure gains in Bromley and Harrow.
The Conservatives also failed to take overall control of Brent, where they
had hoped to exploit memories of previous Labour administrations.
Labour's problems with a generalised 'London effect', with voters punishing
so-called 'loony left' councils, appeared to be at an end. Instead, this
effect was limited to Lambeth, where Labour lost overall control after a
succession of scandals, and Waltham Forest, where the party also lost
overall control.
Mr Tony Travers, head of the Greater London group at the London School of
Economics, said that London had over recent years been moving 'further and
further away from swingometer politics'.
He added: 'London is beginning to break into a kind of new politics of a
number of different two-way battles. It's the way the local electorate is
coming to terms with a two-party system when it wants to have a three-party
system.'
In Enfield, Labour won 10 seats, overturning a Conservative majority of two.
The borough, where Treasury chief secretary Mr Michael Portillo is an MP,
had been Conservative-held for more than 25 years. Liberal Democrats were
not a factor.
Ealing was particularly humiliating for the Conservatives, after they had
confidently predicted victory in the borough on the back of memories of past
Labour administrations. Instead, they lost about 20 seats, including that of
their leader, and Labour was able to crow that it was now trusted in a way
that the Conservatives were not.
But the 'London effect' seemed alive and well in Lambeth, where the Labour
council has been accused of making unlawful payments of more than Pounds
20m. Early results showed the Tories had gained three seats from Labour,
including that of the Labour leader, Mr Steve Whaley. The council seemed set
to be hung.
But in Kingston upon Thames the Liberal Democrats took control after a
straight fight with the Conservatives.
The Conservatives took limited solace from retaining Wandsworth, which has
been lauded by the national party as a 'flagship' council for its policies
for more than a decade. However, losing it would have been almost
unthinkably humiliating for the Conservatives, and Labour campaigners had
been careful to discount any suggestion that they could win the borough.
In Tower Hamlets, much attention focused on the far right British National
Party.
The first result involving a BNP candidate showed a substantial increase in
the far-right party's support since the last municipal elections 4 years
ago.
Although he did not win a seat the candidate achieved 653 votes compared
with the party's 93 in 1990.
But British National Party councillor Mr Derek Beackon, who won the
far-right party's first-ever council seat in a Tower Hamlets council
by-election last september, was defeated last night.
He increased his vote from 1,480 to 2,041 but three Labour candidates in the
Millwall ward all polled more than 3,000 each after a powerful campaign
involving national Labour party figures.
Tower Hamlet council's majority Liberal Democrat group, badly divided over
the ramifications of the BNP by-election win, lost control of the council to
Labour.
