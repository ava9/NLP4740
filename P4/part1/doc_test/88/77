Never mind about the hard words, I was told: there will be plenty of action,
a suicide and eight murders. I had been left in the charge of a female
cousin who had two tickets for a play which my parents told me they would
much rather go to than the comedy they had been invited to that evening.
My cousin explained anxiously that it was rather long, that it would not end
happily, but that there would be a sword-fight and a ghost. This, and the
fact that I had money to buy ice creams for both of us, induced a mood of
great solemnity.
But it did not prepare me for the magic of that cold autumn evening at the
Old Vic theatre 40 years ago. I was just 11 and the young Richard Burton was
being acclaimed as the remarkable new Hamlet. The audience was silent as
soon as he appeared, slim and powerful and in perfect black, restlessly
undermining Claudius's apologia for incest. By the time he strode forward to
the footlights, fixing his gaze on the gods for the great soliloquy, we were
all entranced.
Burton defied every one in the audience to savour every one of his words (as
he was to do much more aggressively in Look Back in Anger, and later as
Petruchio). To an 11-year old who had never before heard 'To be or not to be
. . .', his delivery said simply: 'Listen, I am going to tell you a great
mystery, in poetry.' What the words then meant, I have no idea. Looking back
through the veils of time, it seems I understood every one. But memory is
false: 'Who would fardels bear . . . the proud man's contumely . . . that
undiscovered country from whose bourn . . . Nymph, in thy orisons . . .'
Many hours with the glossary stand between me and that early innocence.
Yet it all made perfect sense, more in a way than many productions I saw
after long study of John Dover Wilson's What Happens in Hamlet and a
shelf-full of other explanatory works. This is not a trick of memory, for
although details decay a profound experience lives on.
It was an experience which not many people have these days, because, leaving
aside Burton's fiercely intelligent cadence, hardly anyone goes to Hamlet
now without first studying the text at school. So they miss the raw power
which Shakespeare exercised over the groundlings - the uneducated riff-raff
who stood in the open courtyard before the stage. They were no doubt quicker
than a 1950s 11-year old to catch the dirty puns ('Get thee to a nunnery' ie
brothel; 'Nothing . . . That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs'
etc, etc). But those groundlings must have had pretty much the same reaction
to the ghost.
Some people are a little embarrased by the ghost, but not I, ever since that
day. There was no messing about then with interpretations, allegories,
anachronisms or (as I once saw) a ghost in a greatcoat standing on a chair.
This one was completely real and terrifying: he rose pale and massive
straight out of the front stage amid billows of green smoke and eerie music.
The apparition explained everything: Hamlet's peculiar behaviour, his
despair and his determination all mixed up in wild and witty words, which
Burton delivered with supreme authority. And then, the sword fight . . . I
must not go on . . . but it was, I believe, superbly executed. Never, since,
have I been so sorry to see Hamlet die, nor felt so strongly the grim
exaltation of an audience facing up to the triumph of evil over good.
A more profound effect, though not realised until much later, was to
understand the power of imagination over facts, people and events. Producers
who try to 'explain' Shakespeare too often forget that, despite the amazing
complexities of his verse, he told a rattling good story which even a child
can enjoy; and that children, particularly, are thrilled by sonorous
language and tales of moral dilemma.
