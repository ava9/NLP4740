Voters on the Isle of Dogs, east London, yesterday came under strong
pressure to reject the far-right British National Party as they went to the
polls in an unusually tense atmosphere.
An increase in racial violence since the BNP won its first local authority
seat - in a Tower Hamlets council by-election on the island last September -
led to voting taking place under conditions of tight security. Large numbers
of police were visible near polling stations and on the streets of the
island.
Fears of intimidation led to a measure remarkable in a British election  -
legal monitors at polling stations. Liberty, the civil liberties
organisation, took the decision to station a team of 30 lawyers on the Isle
of Dogs after complaints by Asian residents that they had faced abuse and
threats during the by-election.
Party representatives, community workers and clergy yesterday all offered to
accompany voters who might fear intimidation.
The Rt Rev Richard Chartres, Anglican bishop of Stepney, and the Rt Rev
Victor Guazzelli, Roman Catholic bishop of East London, joined a vigil for
racial harmony at the Isle of Dogs parish church which included Christian,
Jewish and Islamic prayers. The bishops were among east London clergy who
put their names to a strongly-worded statement expressing concern at the
BNP, but adding: 'As church leaders in the East End we feel for all the
people of the area and their disillusionment with the political process,
which so far seems to have failed them.'
Part of the reason for the BNP finding acceptance, said the statement, was
that Tower Hamlets - one of the poorest areas in Europe - suffered high
unemployment and lack of housing. There was a stark contrast between office
development in Docklands and poverty and deprivation in the community.
The editors of the East End's two newspapers urged their readers to consider
the potentially negative consequences of voting BNP.
Mr Tom Duncan, editor of the Docklands Recorder, wrote: 'Vote if you feel
you must for the British National Party - but do so in the knowledge that
you are voting for people who have nothing to offer you other than hatred
and even more misery.'
As the polls closed and police reinforcements moved in, two fears hung over
east London. The more immediate was that the BNP might strengthen its
position, provoking further racial disharmony and violence in a borough
where a third of the population is from ethnic minorities.
The second was that the BNP would be resoundingly defeated - and that the
government and national political parties would see last year's by-election
result as an aberration with no lasting lessons. The problems facing east
London were 'beyond the capacity of local resources to solve,' warned the
clergy statement.
