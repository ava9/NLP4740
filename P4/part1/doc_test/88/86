The Everybody's Shakespeare International Festival shared by the Royal
Shakespeare Company and its host the Barbican Centre managed to run two
versions of Romeo and Juliet simultaneously on Wednesday and Thursday. While
the Dusseldorfer Schauspielhaus actors swinging on their swings were
presenting their German-speaking Romeo und Julia at Barbican Theatre, the
members of the London Symphony Orchestra under Mstislav Rostropovich in
Barbican Hall were playing a selection of Prokofiev's famous music for a
(1939) ballet of the play, with spoken commentaries interpolated between the
ten numbers by the actor Michael Feast.
Who selected the music from Prokofiev's own two suites and who the text  -
which melded prosaic summaries of the action with Shakepeare's glittering
poetry - we were not informed, but the result was a reasonably satisfying
dramatic whole, albeit marred by Feast's sometimes over-obvious actorly
pauses and by moments of brutal bathos. After the axe-like orchestral blows
of 'The Death of Tybalt' we did not need to be told that Tybalt had died.
The music is better left unglossed, especially as it was bringing out the
golden best of the orchestra. The beautifully soaring cellos, the melting
celesta, the guest leader Yuri Torchinsky's fetching solo contribution to an
altogether wonderfully realised balcony nocturne, the unprecedentedly
blood-curdling tuttis - all was sonorous magic in Rostropovich's carefully
measured account.
Earlier we had had Balakirev's rarely heard King Lear overture - an example
of the blunt Russification of Shakespeare to add to Tchaikovsky's powerfully
simplifying overtures - and Shostakovich's suite, Op. 32a, from his
incidental music to what apparently was a highly facetious (1932) production
of a Russian-speaking Hamlet by Nikolai Pavlovich Akimov. These 13 wittily
serviceable numbers are not much more interesting as pure music than
Shostakovich's 1959 musical Cheryomushki, recently revived at the
Hammersmith Lyric; but they deliver the authentic smart smack of early
Shostakovich, and are doubtless worth an occasional outing, certainly when
done with the LSO's verve.
