LEADERS of all the main political parties yesterday condemned the local
by-election victory of the far-right British National party.
But Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, was forced on to the
defensive by Labour accusations that his party had issued racist leaflets
during the by-election campaign in Tower Hamlets, east London. He announced
an inquiry into the activities of local party members.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said he hoped the BNP's first-ever
council success would not be repeated. 'I think it was an unfortunate result
and I want to make it clear that there is no place in our society for these
sort of policies,' he said.
Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, said the outcome represented 'a
deeply depressing day for democracy'.
In a strongly worded statement, the archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George
Carey, denounced racist policies as evil and emphasised: 'Christian people
should condemn and resist racism by all lawful means.'
The victory for Mr Derek Beackon, who won Millwall ward from Labour by seven
votes, has raised fears that the racial tensions that formed the backdrop to
the by-election campaign might erupt into violence again.
In a letter to the leaders of the Liberal Democrat group that runs Tower
Hamlets council, Mr Ashdown expressed grave concern yesterday that one of
the party leaflets 'could lend itself to a racist interpretation'.
He insisted that racism had no place in the Liberal Democrat party, and
emphasised that any party member who was proved to have acted in a racist
way would immediately be expelled.
The need for an investigation into the activities of Liberal Democrats is
particularly embarrassing for the party, which holds its annual conference
in Torquay next week. But party managers hope that by acting promptly they
will have succeeded in containing the setback.
Mr Jonathan Matthews, secretary of the Liberal Democrats' Tower Hamlets
branch, said local party members would go along with the investigation, but
vehemently denied that they were racist. 'We have a lot of Bangladeshi
members,' he said.
'We fought an extremely strong campaign and a very, very straight one. There
wasn't the slightest hint of trying to take advantage of any racial
tension.'
The immediate concern in Tower Hamlets is whether the BNP victory will lead
to an increase in the level of racially motivated violence on the streets.
Tomorrow the Bangladeshi Welfare Association has invited local MPs,
councillors and religious leaders to a meeting to protest against racial
attacks.
