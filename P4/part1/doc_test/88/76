FROM THE SYNAGOGUE TO A 'CRUSH' THAT TURNED WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE INTO AN 
OBSESSION

What's a nice Jewish boy like Ben Donenberg doing with a crush on William 
Shakespeare? 
</P>
<P>
"Shakespeare is my obsession," admits the actor-turned-entrepreneur. "I don't 
care if he really existed or not; I just love his plays." Under Donenberg's 
artistic directorship, Shakespeare Festival/LA has set out to spread that 
sentiment throughout Los Angeles; this weekend it launches a fifth season of 
free performances beginning at Hollywood's John Anson Ford Amphitheater 
(through July 14), followed by a July 18 to 28 run at Citicorp Plaza downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"It started around eight years ago," recalled Donenberg, 33, who trained as an 
actor at Juilliard. "I was playing a valet in 'Amadeus' on Broadway, and after 
about four months of moving furniture, I started needing a creative outlet." 
The idea of a community theater company was still bubbling in 1983 when he 
moved to Los Angeles to pursue a master's degree in philosophy at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking back at the Greeks -- 2,500 years ago, when Athens was a lot 
like Los Angeles," he said. "All the fields were just starting to develop -- 
business, commerce, art, mathematics -- and I think as people began to 
individuate themselves in these pursuits, they looked for ways to connect, to 
create community: 'Although we have different interests, we're still alike.' 
That's what the original Greek theater festivals must have been like: free, 
outdoors, and everybody attended." 
</P>
<P>
For Donenberg (whose space-age spoof "Starship Shakespeare" was a 1985 hit at 
Al's Bar downtown), that sense of community began in his native Skokie, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
"I hung out a lot at the synagogue as a child," he said. "My father died when I 
was very young, so becoming religious, was, I guess, a way of repairing the 
damage. I used to sit in the synagogue listening to the rabbi give his sermons 
and think, 'This is great.' But even though it was a noble thing -- to raise 
people's ethical and moral way of living -- there's a whole world out there 
that isn't Jewish; there should be a way of doing it that cuts across 
religion." 
</P>
<P>
The step into theater was a short one. "I was in the Hebrew school plays; I 
played Queen Esther with a wig on," he said with a chuckle, remembering an 
all-male production. "One time, we were given an extra credit assignment if we 
watched Olivier's 'Hamlet' on TV and wrote a report about it. I didn't 
understand much except that Hamlet's father died and came back as a ghost. I 
said, 'Hey, I can identify with that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Although he pursued acting steadily (including two summers at the National 
Shakespeare Conservatory in Woodstock, N.Y.), "It gradually became apparent to 
me that, although I had talent, the world didn't really need another great 
actor. What it needed was more people to create playgrounds for them to play 
in." Intuitively, he turned to Ira Gershwin's widow (for whom he'd been editing 
George and Ira's scrapbooks) and asked for her help in starting a community 
Shakespeare festival. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a Cinderella story," he said happily. Recalling that Citicorp had 
sponsored New York's Shakespeare in the Park, he picked up the phone book and 
called Citicorp. "I said, 'I have a little bit of help from Mrs. Gershwin, will 
you help?' and they said, 'Sure.' You know how people scramble around to raise 
money? Citicorp said, 'Come in right now, we want to talk to you.' They were 
new in town and wanted something they could be identified with -- and they've 
been a major funder ever since." 
</P>
<P>
Donenberg's first festival site was Pershing Square in the heart of downtown. 
At his urging, the Community Redevelopment Agency got on board -- as did Actors 
Equity, with whom he negotiated special contracts for his players, "because I 
don't think anybody should work for free." Shakespeare Festival/LA now also 
boasts a full-time, 14-member board of directors, additional corporate 
sponsorship and a new educational program for children. 
</P>
<P>
This year, "Shakespearience!" has traveled to elementary schools with a puppet 
adaptation of "A Midsummer Night's Dream." "We also send out a dance instructor 
who teaches the kids the Elizabethan Washerwoman's Brawl -- expose them to 
music and dance, costumes, Shakespeare's words. An actor pretends he's 
Shakespeare and talks about what it was like to live then." 
</P>
<P>
This summer, the main stage fare is "Much Ado About Nothing," a comedy, said 
the show's director Kevin Kelley, "that's very much about appearances -- very 
appropriate today in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the plots in the play have to do with the danger of denying true 
feelings for appearance's sake," added Kelley, who believes that "Much Ado's" 
inherent seriousness is often overlooked. "People wear masks of wit, social 
decorum, egotism. It's also about the privileged segments of society and the 
quality of language." He has set the play on a tony American island retreat in 
1932, and scored it with jazz of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Despite quality production values and professional actors, all plays are 
presented free. (Attendees are asked to bring a can of non-perishable goods for 
the needy; last year, a matching gift from Vons netted $40,000 worth of donated 
foodstuff.) "We want to be accessible and available to whoever wants to 
attend," Donenberg says. 
</P>
<P>
Proud though he is of the rapid rise of the Festival (no relation to the 
now-defunct L.A. Free Shakespeare Festival), Donenberg is still hustling for 
bigger and better. He's negotiating with USC for its 1,600-seat Embassy Theatre 
downtown; just this year, he began drawing a regular paycheck. All that 
activity leaves little time for a personal life. Even mom has stopped praying 
for him to find the perfect wife: "At this point, she says, 'Will you just find 
someone, please?" 
</P>
<P>
"Establishing a theatrical tradition is very difficult," he acknowledged. "It 
is an uphill battle. The paper work is oppressive; we're understaffed, 
overworked. I don't feel like I'm sacrificing -- really. It's more like I'm 
trading off. The trade-off is personal comforts for the feeling that comes from 
knowing you've helped culturally enrich your community, created a place where 
people from all walks of life can sit and breathe and laugh and cry together. 
When you see the reward, it's always worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Much Ado About Nothing" plays at 7:30 tonight, Friday and Saturday at the 
John Anson Ford Amphitheater, 2580 Cahuenga Blvd. East in Hollywood, and at 
Citicorp Plaza, 725 S. Figueroa Ave., at 6:45 p.m. July 18 to 28 (free 
parking). In lieu of an admission charge, donations of canned food for the 
needy will be accepted. General admission tickets are available at all Music 
Plus outlets and Ticketmaster locations in May Co. department stores. For 
membership information: (213) 489-1121.
