Big ceased to be beautiful long ago in Britain's town halls. For more than a
decade, decentralisation has been the craze in local government. But no
authority has taken it so far - or so fast - as Tower Hamlets, the Liberal
Democrat-controlled borough in London's East End.
The Liberals have divided the borough, London's poorest, into seven
'neighbourhood councils'. Each has its own staff, budget, offices and
elected committee responsible for executing most of the borough's functions
in its territory.
'Tower Hamlets only exists in name,' says Eric Flounders, the Liberals'
former leader - now chairman of Bow neighbourhood - who carried out the
dissection after defeating Labour in the 1986 borough elections. 'But that
was true before we acted: the constituent neighbourhoods were always the
real local communities.'
Tower Hamlets is a 1960s amalgamation of Bethnal Green, Stepney and Poplar.
Those names adorn three of the new neighbourhoods, but all seven are carved
from their territory. With 34,000 residents, the largest - Poplar - covers a
population greater than that of 27 district councils across the UK and would
be on the large side as a first-tier authority in France or Germany. But
with the smallest a mere 15,000-strong, even sympathetic observers think
there are a few neighbourhoods too many.
How was it done? At a stroke - almost literally. Amid uproar, the first
council meeting after the 1986 elections saw Flounders move sheaves of
amendments to council standing orders - creating the neighbourhoods and
disbanding most of the council's central committees. The central
administration was stripped to the bone and chief officers were obliged to
become neighbourhood chief executives. Few stayed long.
Neighbourhood units are not unique to Tower Hamlets. The model for less
radical reformers is Islington, in north London. Under a progressive Labour
administration, it has set up 24 neighbourhood offices across the borough:
all residents are within quarter of a mile of an office; each has a staff to
deal with queries - mainly housing - along with a small budget, and a forum
of local residents which meets every six weeks to discuss issues in its
area.
Yet Islington's central committee and administrative structure are still
intact. Tower Hamlets has largely disbanded both. Education, overall
budget-making and social service strategy remain with the centre; standard
terms and conditions are observed for employment contracts; beyond that,
everything - planning, parks-recreation, housing, highways, environmental
health, libraries, even most lawyers and accountants - has been handed down.
Political and administrative control within those spheres lies with the
neighbourhood councils, two of which are controlled by the 'opposition'
Labour party. Each neighbourhood has autonomy within its devolved sphere
unless its chief executive believes it 'is not in a sufficient state of
readiness' to implement a decision.
Even the direct labour-force has been divided, with seven separate depots.
Each neighbourhood has control over its own contracts: most have stayed
in-house, but Bethnal Green has awarded some to the private sector.
'It's a sham, of course', says John Biggs, the borough's Labour leader. 'We
run two neighbourhoods, but they set the annual budget, and that's clearly
fixed against us.' He condemns the devolved structure as 'massively
bureaucratic', pointing to the Pounds 700,000 salary bill for the borough's
chief executives alone.
Flounders denies the first claim: funds are allocated by formula, and losers
include Liberal neighbourhoods. He concedes that devolution may have
increased the administrative staff, but claims that this is balanced by
savings elsewhere.
'The positive advantages are enormous', he claims, citing the borough's rent
arrears. In 1985/6 arrears stood at the London average of 13 per cent of the
rent collectable. Now they are down to 6 per cent.
'It comes down to an argument about the cost of democracy itself', says Paul
Hoggett of Bristol University, who has made a detailed study. 'Neighbourhood
councils have to be serviced and administrative costs have gone up. But
service-delivery costs appear to be lower and the evidence suggests the
experiment has improved the quality of local democracy.' That is undeniable,
if turnout in local elections is a reliable guide: it is up from 31 per cent
in 1982 to 47 per cent in 1990 - a shift from well below to well above the
London average.
Clive Jacotine, Bow neighbourhood's chief executive and former assistant
director of housing in Lewisham, believes the experiment makes sound
management sense.
'The ability to bring everyone together easily, without having to get
involved in inter-departmental processes, is a great advantage,' he says.
Politics has changed too: 'The major conflict is between the neighbourhoods
and the centre, not between the political parties'.
Bow's management team comprises Jacotine and six 'service heads' - for
planning, highways, environmental services, economic development, housing,
and general-support services, including libraries. They all operate from the
Bow neighbourhood centre - a purpose-built block off Roman Road, which also
houses the local library, and a GP's practice. A gym and sauna are coming
soon.
The relationship between each neighbourhood's chief executive and committee
chairman is necessarily close. Flounders and Jacotine meet at least once a
fortnight. 'We get on well', says Jacotine. 'But if we didn't, I'd soon be
out: personal rapport is much more important than between a committee
chairman and a chief officer in a traditional authority.' Chief executives
are on three-year rolling contracts, renewable annually.
Tower Hamlets took control of eduction in the borough on the abolition of
the Inner London Education Authority in 1990. Under local management of
schools, most funds go direct to schools with the centre responsible for
strategy, inspection, and ensuring adequate servicing. But neighbourhoods
are still in the picture: they control the borough's Pounds 6m community
education budget, subject to oversight and inspection. They also provide
personnel and payroll services through 'service level agreements' with the
education department. 'But the position is clear,' says Anne Sofer, chief
education officer: 'The buck stops with the centre.'
Six years on, other councils have yet to copy Tower Hamlets. Even Liberal
Richmond, at the other, affluent end of the District Line, refuses to follow
suit. 'It's snobbery as much as anything', says Flounders. 'But don't worry:
give it a decade, and they'll all be doing it.'
