FT  20 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Jermyn Investment Pounds 0.77m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jermyn Investment Co, the shares and property investor, tumbled to a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 772,727 for the year to December 31 1991 compared with
profits of Pounds 267,538 in 1990.
The result was after an exceptional Pounds 650,000 write-down in the value
of investment properties.
The loss per share amounted to 49.75p (3.51p earnings) but a final dividend
of 1.5p (3p) is proposed as a 'measure of confidence in the future.'
Net property income rose to Pounds 123,672 (Pounds 106,722) while income
from fixed asset investments fell to Pounds 63,723 (Pounds 72,894).
