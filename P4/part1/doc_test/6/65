FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Embassy Property cuts loss to Pounds 1.45m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A significant reduction in losses in its property development and
residential divisions helped Embassy Property Group cut its pre-tax deficit
by Pounds 948,000 to Pounds 1.45m in the six months to September 30.
The divisions were free of the Pounds 3.75m provisions carried in 1991-92
against the value of work in progress and investment properties.
Overall sales of the USM-quoted group in the first half came to Pounds 5.91m
(Pounds 6.33m). The input from property development and trading fell to
Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 778,000). But residential development raised its
share to Pounds 2.39m (Pounds 1.38m).
Losses from the two areas fell to Pounds 563,000 (Pounds 1.32m) and Pounds
198,000 (Pounds 536,000) respectively.
Overhead and interest costs contracted to Pounds 351,000 (Pounds 416,000)
helped by the debt restructuring in September.
An extraordinary credit of Pounds 5.46m reflected completion of the
refinancing and connected share placing. The directors said the rights issue
was not reflected as the closing date was October 5.
This left a retained profit of Pounds 4.01m (Pounds 2m loss). On a much
increased capital base there was a loss per share of 9.9p (26.1p).
