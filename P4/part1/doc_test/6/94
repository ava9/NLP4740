FT  18 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Greycoat Pounds 40m in the red and calls
for Pounds 47m

Greycoat, the property developer rescued from the brink of collapse last
November, has launched a Pounds 47m rights issue to purchase and refinance
the remaining 50 per cent of 123/151 Buckingham Palace Road, London, which
has been valued at Pounds 159m.
It is paying Pounds 18.2m for Sir Robert McAlpine Group's half of the
386,600 sq ft office and retail property.
Greycoat also announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 40m (Pounds 167m) for the
year to end-March. However, the company returned to profitability in the
second half with Pounds 3.5m pre-tax. Losses per share were 10.5p (92.5p).
Mr Richard Guignard, joint managing director, described the latest
transaction as 'a housekeeping exercise'. A Pounds 125m loan attached to the
property was due for repayment next January, giving Greycoat the choice
between buying the remaining half, or selling the property. The loan will be
replaced with a Pounds 82.5m facility from Hypo Bank, and the remaining
Pounds 42.5m will be covered by the rights proceeds and internal resources.
The cash call will allow Greycoat to progress beyond mere survival, but the
stock market reacted unenthusiastically to the deal. The shares fell 1 1/2 p
to 15 1/2 p.
Some analysts expressed concern over the proximity to last November's
restructuring by Mr Brian Myerson and Mr Julian Treger, the South African
investors who enabled the company to avoid receivership.
Mr Treger said: 'It is a one-off opportunity to consolidate the portfolio,
as part of the ongoing restructuring of Greycoat.'
The offer is on a 3-for-8 basis at 13p, a discount of 24 per cent to the
previous closing price. The issue is underwritten by NM Rothschild and
Samuel Montagu.
The rights will dilute net asset value from 17.4p, as of March, to 15.9p,
but it is sufficiently above the rights price to encourage support for the
issue.
Gearing will fall from 152 per cent to 137 per cent.
Greycoat will emerge with 100 per cent ownership of two significant
properties, and an option on a third.
Britannic House, in London's Finsbury Circus, was effectively ring-fenced to
protect Greycoat, but the company can repurchase it up to 2002, at a price
which reflects the obligations of the debtors rather than the value of the
property.
Once the property value, currently Pounds 133m, exceeds the Pounds 150m
value of debt, virtually all additional valuation increase would accrue to
shareholders, Mr Guignard said.
In addition, Greycoat revealed that it planned to proceed with the
controversial Pounds 350m development of Paternoster Square in early 1995,
subject to securing development financing.
It owns 21 per cent of the City project, which last August received planning
consents. Its Pounds 15m investment has been written down to nothing, and Mr
Guignard was adamant that Greycoat would not invest further capital into
development projects. However, Greycoat's project management role could
leave it with a carrying stake in the largest new development in the City.
Following the rights issue, the company is proposing a 1-for-10 share
consolidation.
