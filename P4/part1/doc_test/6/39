FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Mowlem dives to Pounds 10m loss

JOHN MOWLEM, the house-builder and contractor, plunged to a Pounds 9.9m
pre-tax loss in the first half of 1992, partly reflecting a Pounds 2.5m
operating deficit on London City Airport and a Pounds 3m provision for
Canary Wharf, the insolvent Docklands office project.
The loss came on turnover of Pounds 669m, and compared with a pre-tax profit
of Pounds 7m on sales of Pounds 697m. Losses per share were 9.2p (earnings
4.7p).
The interim dividend is cut by 65 per cent to 2p (5.65p). But the group
emphasised that it remained in a sound financial position, with strong
positive cash flows.
At the operating level there was a loss of Pounds 1.9m (profit Pounds 8.9m).
The main businesses of contracting, housing, scaffolding and equipment hire
in the UK all made profits although, with the exception of scaffolding, less
than in either of the previous two half years.
Operating loss at London City Airport, in which Mowlem has a 90 per cent
stake, had previously been covered by a Pounds 33m provision set up in 1989,
but this was used up last year. Earlier this month Mowlem announced plans to
sell part of its airport stake and Sir Philip Beck, chairman, said yesterday
that there had been 'a lot of interest' expressed
Commenting on the group's performance, Sir Philip said attention had been
focused on cost reductions in all areas, the disposal of non-core assets and
businesses, cash control within all companies and the maintenance of the
strong and cash positive contracting business.
Cash flow was bolstered by sales of private houses, and the disposal of
non-core businesses and property sales from the discontinued property
development side raised Pounds 23m.
However, as a result of a short-term increase in borrowings, net interest
charges rose to Pounds 5.1m (Pounds 1.9m).
Borrowings will be reduced by the Dollars 30m proceeds of the disposal of
the North American scaffolding business, a sale which provides a premium to
net asset value.
As part of this process of withdrawal from North America, Mowlem was also
closing its Canadian operation which would result in an extraordinary loss.
These decisions, together with costs and possible tax liability, would
result in an extraordinary loss of Pounds 4.3m in the year's accounts.
COMMENT
Mowlem has pulled out of commercial property, run down its housing landbank,
quit North American scaffolding and is looking for a City Airport partner.
The company says that the remaining core contracting business is performing
well in terms of profits, cash generation and relatively well in orders won.
End-year gearing likely to be closer to 30 per cent than 40 per cent. But
most analysts are in the sceptical camp. Pre-tax losses could be Pounds
15m-Pounds 20m this year, and losses will continue at least in 1993 given
the dearth of big projects. Further cuts in the core are likely so perhaps
Mowlem should not be paying dividends out of reserves. It is no surprise the
shares are trading just above their all-time low.
