FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Provisions cut Bryant to Pounds 7.5m

BRYANT GROUP, the West Midlands-based construction company, confirmed
yesterday that consumer confidence was improving and that there were signs
of re-kindled purchaser interest in new homes.
The announcement accompanied the group's interim results, which showed that
pre-tax profits had fallen from Pounds 9.8m to Pounds 7.5m for the half year
to November 30.
Bryant is the latest housebuilder to suggest that the combination of low
interest rates, falling prices and 'the favourable affordability ratio,' is
tempting buyers to return to the market.
Mr Andrew MacKenzie, chief executive, said the company had seen 'a 30 per
cent year-on-year increase in both visitors and net house reservations' in
the last two months.
These early signs of recovery were strongest in the south-east, but had also
begun to feed through to the Midlands, he said.
Despite depressed market conditions last year, Bryant's housebuilding
division managed to perform well helping the group to maintain operating
profits in the opening half at Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 10.9m) on turnover which
fell by 15 per cent from Pounds 163.5m to Pounds 138.4m.
However, a Pounds 1.9m loss in the group's associated undertakings, which
mainly reflected Pounds 1.5m in provisions against the group's interest in
property developments in Dublin and Birmingham, was behind the fall in
profits at the pre-tax level.
Total provisions of Pounds 3.5m included Pounds 1m against assets in each of
the property and housing divisions.
Earnings per share fell to 1.9p (2.5p). However, based on the more positive
outlook the interim dividend is maintained at 1.4p.
In the first half the homes division increased sales by almost 5 per cent to
Pounds 100.9m (Pounds 96.3m) and operating profits from Pounds 7.9m to
Pounds 8.7m.
The number of house completions jumped by more than 13 per cent to 1,290.
Turnover in the property division fell to Pounds 7.1m (Pounds 10.8m)
reflecting the harsh trading environment in both the UK and Ireland.
The division incurred an operating loss of Pounds 600,000 (profit Pounds
300,000).
The group said it planned to further reduce the level of its investment in
property.
Turnover in the construction side of Pounds 30.8m (Pounds 57.1m) was in line
with expectations and operating profits of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 2.7m)
reflected a number of settlements related to old contracts.
The division continued to reject work where margins were inadequate.
COMMENT
Bryant's upbeat market assessment, following similar optimistic noises from
other builders, helped the shares jump 7p to 124p yesterday. Despite the
recession and falling prices the management has succeeded in maintaining
housebuilding volumes and margins, while making prudent provisions where
necessary. The balance sheet shows group borrowings of Pounds 9.3m,
representing gearing of 5 per cent, a level which will enable the group to
fund land purchases to support its expanding regional house-building
activities. Of more concern are the Pounds 52m of associated companies'
borrowings, some Pounds 20m of which are attributable to Bryant but which
are due to decline. Providing there are no surprise provisions pre-tax
profits should reach about Pounds 17m this year and Pounds 25m next. But
with earnings this year of about 4.4p the recent run-up in the share price
makes even this quality stock look expensive. Nevertheless, it is a buy on
signs of price weakness.
