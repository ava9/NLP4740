SCOTTISH Metropolitan Property, Scotland's leading property investment
company, made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 489,563 and passed its final dividend
for the year ended August 15.
This compares with a loss of Pounds 8.37m after an exceptional charge of
Pounds 11.6m to cover write-downs and bank fees for renegotiating debt
payments in the previous year.
Net asset value per share fell to 113.8p from 145.4p. The main reason for
this year's loss is the increase in the net interest charge to Pounds 20.7m
(Pounds 14m) charged through the profit and loss account.
Only Pounds 860,000 of interest was capitalised, compared to Pounds 8.86m,
following completion of the group's development programme.
Mr Scott Calms, who was appointed managing director in January, said the
accounting policy was not to capitalise interest beyond practical completion
of a development.
The developments include Saltire Court, 66 per cent let and Hay Weight
House, unlet, in Edinburgh, and National House, 5 per cent let, in
Manchester.
'If we increase letting revenue it will flow directly to the profit and loss
account,' said Mr Calms.
In spite of net property sales of Pounds 31.8m, rental income rose by 16 per
cent to Pounds 22.6m (Pounds 19.4m) with revenue from properties up from
Pounds 18.7m to Pounds 21.4m.
The valuation of the group's properties at August 15 was Pounds 285.7m,
which reflected an overall decline of 8 per cent compared with the book
value.
As the group warned at the end of September, there is no final dividend. An
interim of 1.5p (2.53p) was paid in August.
Borrowings were Pounds 170.3m (Pounds 201.3m).
There were losses per share of 0.89p compared with losses of 9.93p.
