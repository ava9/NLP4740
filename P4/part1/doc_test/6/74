THE DIRECTORS of Thorn EMI, the electrical and entertainment group, have
paid themselves on average more than the board of any other quoted company
reporting during the past year, according to the latest issue of the
Performance Rankings Guide issued yesterday.
Average remuneration for directors earning more than Pounds 20,000 in the
company was Pounds 850,000 for the year to March 31 1992.
Next highest was the board of Tiphook, the freight container and trailer
leasing group, which awarded the average director Pounds 616,000 in its most
recent financial year, followed by Lonrho, the international conglomerate,
which paid an average Pounds 597,000.
The figures come from a quarterly guide published by Hemmington Scott, the
corporate information supplier, which analyses dozens of trends revealed in
the most recent annual reports released by 1,802 UK-quoted companies.
Lonrho has the largest differential between the average amount it pays its
directors and that paid to its employees. The difference is 165 times, with
the average director receiving Pounds 597,000 and the average employee
Pounds 3,630, explained in part by Lonrho's large African operations.
It also has the highest paid director, Mr 'Tiny' Rowland, at Pounds 1.6m in
the year to September 30 1991. Five other directors received more than
Pounds 1m a year in their most recent reports: at Hanson, SmithKline
Beecham, Tesco, Glaxo and BOC.
However, the greatest absolute increase in salary of a director was Mr Mike
Hennessy of Kalon, the paint maker. His remuneration rose by Pounds 618,000
to Pounds 784,000 in the year to December 31 last year, thanks to a
performance-related bonus.
The highest average pay for employees was Pounds 70,100 at Candover, the
investment trust. It was lowest at Inch Kenneth Kajang, which grows oil
palms in Malaysia, at Pounds 150 a year.
Sterling Trust, the USM-quoted financial services company, covered its
liabilities by assets by the highest ratio, at 28.3 times, while the lowest
was Jermyn Investment, the shares and property investor, at 0.04.
Jupiter Tyndall, the fund management group, had the greatest liquidity -
measured by the proportion of capital employed in cash and current asset
investments - while Erskine House, the office equipment services company,
had the highest gearing - or ratio of debt to equity - at 17,531 per cent.
The largest growth in earnings per share over the past five years was at
Vodafone, the mobile telephone company, at an average of 291 per cent a
year.
A separate publication also released yesterday by Hemmington Scott, called
the Company Guide, shows that 52 companies have been removed from a Stock
Exchange quotation during the four months period from April to June, and 11
new ones joined. Ten quoted companies were acquired during the quarter, and
22 changed their names.
Among professional advisers, Cazenove and Rowe &amp; Pitman are the stockbrokers
which have both the most quoted clients by number and those making the most
profit. Rowe &amp; Pitman and de Zoete &amp; Bevan have the clients with fastest
growth in pre-tax profits and earnings per share (which meant the smallest
decline for the period).
For solicitors, Slaughter &amp; May and Linklaters &amp; Paines have most quoted
clients and those making most profit. Slaughter &amp; May and McKenna have both
the fastest earnings and profits growth.
Among financial advisers, SG Warburg has the largest number and the most
profitable clients, followed by Lazard Brothers and Schroders respectively.
Robert Fleming and Barings have those with fastest earnings and profits
growth.
For auditors, Coopers &amp; Lybrand has clients making the most profit. KPMG
Peat Marwick has the most stock market clients by number, and Ernst &amp; Young
the clients with fastest pre-tax profits growth.
However, Robson Rhodes - which is only the 14th largest firm by fee income -
had the quoted clients with fastest earnings growth.
