MOUNTLEIGH GROUP, the debt-laden property company, yesterday announced
pre-tax losses of Pounds 73.7m for the six months to October 31 and passed
its interim dividend. A year earlier, it made a Pounds 12m pre-tax profit
and declared a 1.25p interim pay-out.
These heavy losses are the latest in a series of announcements by the
company. Last summer, it announced a Pounds 96.1m annual pre-tax loss and
the breach of its banking covenants.
It launched a Pounds 96m rights issue, which provoked a public censure by
the stock exchange. In October, the chairman and three joint managing
directors resigned before the company's annual meeting, as a result of the
change of strategy.
About half the loss was due to a provision taken on its Merry Hill shopping
centre in the West Midlands, which it has agreed to sell for Pounds 125m to
investors led by the O'Connor Group, a US pension fund adviser, in
partnership with Hammerson property group. The deal is likely to take
several weeks to complete.
The difference between Merry Hill's book value of Pounds 160.4m and the sale
price was the main cause of a Pounds 40.1m exceptional charge. In addition,
the exceptional charge included Pounds 6.5m of the Pounds 9.8m costs of last
summer's Pounds 96m rights issue.
The interim results suffered from an increase in the interest charge from
Pounds 26m to Pounds 35.5m, largely because it has stopped capitalising
interest. Net borrowings stood at Pounds 526.4m at October 31 compared with
Pounds 641.1m at May 31. Operating profits in the UK fell from Pounds 11.2m
to Pounds 7.9m. Property sales dropped from Pounds 116.7m to Pounds 48.6m
with a further Pounds 22m raised from the sale of investment properties in
Spain. Rents and service charges increased from Pounds 10.7m to Pounds
13.3m. The sale of Merry Hill, which has a rent roll of Pounds 10.8m, will
significantly reduce rental income in future.
Galerias, the Spanish department store, made a Pounds 1.9m loss, as
increases in operating costs offset an increase in sales and gross margins.
Sir Ian MacGregor, chairman, who is recovering from heart surgery,
reiterated Mountleigh's objectives of reducing debt by selling its UK and
continental property portfolio and positioning Galerias Preciados as a high
quality Spanish retail business. There was a loss per share of 20.1p,
compared with earnings per share of 4.7p a year earlier.
