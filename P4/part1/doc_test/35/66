Most of the day's excitement takes place around breakfast time as the
Olympic athletics competition gets under way with the heats of the 100
metres and Linford Christie starting his quest for a medal. Other fancied
Britons competing today include javelin thrower Tessa Sanderson and Tom
McKean in the 800 metres. BBC 1 starts transmissions at 8.25am.
It's amazing how Alan Whicker maintains his enthusiasm for travel but here
he is accompanying 87 mainly elderly high fliers on the ultimate package
tour of 14 countries in 34 days. They pop in at the Taj Mahal and the Great
Wall of China before settling with relief on Hong Kong for some serious
shopping. ITV at 8.00pm.
The Player is presently one of the most beguiling movies on the circuit and
its subject matter, the vulnerable position in a Hollywood studio of the
screen writer, is topically investigated for real in Naked Hollywood (BBC 2
at 9.30). Writers are treated incredibly badly but in compensation get rich
financial rewards. This is the first in a repeat of an excellent series.
East, the programme devoted to Asian affairs, returns to BBC 2 at 8.00pm.
