Amid signs that Donald J. Trump's financial problems are worsening, a report 
released Thursday shows that the deal maker is in danger of missing a 
$47-million junk-bond payment due Nov. 15 on the Taj Mahal casino hotel in 
Atlantic City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The report, released by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, is a 
scathing assessment of the finances of Trump's most costly and lavish 
investment, the opulent $1-billion gaming palace that opened in April. It also 
says the Trump Shuttle is dangerously low on cash and the Trump Castle casino 
hotel, which got an 11th-hour rescue in June, may face a repeat crisis next 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, asked at the New Jersey Casino Control Commission hearings about a 
possible default on the Taj Mahal bond payment, responded with a terse, "No 
comment."
