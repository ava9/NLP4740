By fall 1987, not even all the king's horses and all the king's men could have 
helped unpaid creditors put Wieboldt Stores back together again. The venerable 
Chicago retailer was more than bankrupt; its merchandise had been liquidated, 
and its dozen or so stores shuttered early that summer. 
</P>
<P>
So the creditors did the next best thing: They staked their claim to the 
shattered pieces by suing the financiers, executives and even public 
shareholders who had made possible or profited from the leveraged buyout of 
Wieboldt in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
And in so doing, the Wieboldt creditors pulled a string that many believe could 
unravel some of the business excesses of the 1980s -- an intricate weave of 
LBOs, greenmail, golden handshakes and junk bond financing -- and at the end, 
find and hold liable those responsible for the loss of jobs, profits and whole 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
The Wieboldt case was the first significant application of a simple, 
centuries-old legal concept called fraudulent conveyance to that most modern 
and sophisticated of financial transactions, the leveraged buyout of a publicly 
traded company. In an LBO, the buyers raise money to take over a company by 
mortgaging or selling its assets and using the proceeds to buy out the other 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, dozens of fraudulent conveyance suits have been filed or 
threatened in the wake of failed LBOs. Already they have proven to be powerful 
tools in creditors' hands. And, bankruptcy experts believe, as more companies 
face the bills on their buyout debt in an economic downturn, the stage is set 
for a staggering amount of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
"This . . . is going to be the dominant issue in insolvency in the next five 
years as more and more of the LBOs hit the wall," said Dan S. Schechter, 
professor at Loyola Law School at Loyola-Marymount University in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Simply put, the fraudulent conveyance suits seek to undo heavily leveraged 
takeovers, arguing that companies such as Wieboldt didn't get a fair exchange 
when their assets were mortgaged and that the deals left them too crippled to 
continue to operate. Creditors are claiming that money owed them went instead 
to pay the people involved in the deals -- not just shareholders, but 
investment bankers, lawyers and other advisers. 
</P>
<P>
There are still many questions about how far a fraudulent conveyance suit can 
go in undoing an LBO or in roping back assets and money that have long since 
been distributed. Allan Dinkoff, a New York lawyer representing defendants in 
another LBO-related lawsuit, said: "Once an egg is scrambled, it's hard to 
unscramble it." 
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission finds especially troublesome the 
prospect that years down the road, shareholders who had nothing to do with 
running the companies could be forced to return money they received in the 
deals. Successful suits, the SEC warned in arguments it filed last month in a 
case involving the 1984 sale of Kaiser Steel, could wreak havoc in the stock 
markets and cause investments to wither. 
</P>
<P>
The suits that have been pursued are still dragging through the courts, with no 
end in sight. With potentially thousands of defendants and hundreds of 
cross-claims for each case, "it will be a terrible mess," Schechter of Loyola 
said, "and no one is going to benefit except the lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than risk doubtful outcomes after lengthy and costly court battles, many 
players on both sides of the suit have chosen to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
In the Wieboldt case, claims against lenders who financed the deal have been 
settled, with the proceeds going to other creditors. Additional claims, 
including those against directors and inside shareholders -- company 
executives, for example -- are pending. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any clear path yet; everyone seems to be feeling their 
way," said Joel M. Wolosky, a New York lawyer who represents Wieboldt 
defendants. "Right now it's being used as a wedge in order to get settlements 
in the bankruptcy court." 
</P>
<P>
Even though these settlements often net only a fraction of the sums involved, 
there have been major victories for creditors -- especially unsecured creditors 
who traditionally stand near the end of the line in bankruptcy payouts. Some 
include: 
</P>
<P>
* Creditors of now-bankrupt Revco D.S., an Ohio-based drugstore chain that was 
taken private in a $1.25-billion buyout in 1986 and into bankruptcy court in 
1988, say their suit, which includes claims against 7,000 holders of junk bonds 
used to finance the buyout, helped prompt acceptance of their plan for the 
company's reorganization. Some creditors who would have been paid only 50 cents 
on the dollar under earlier proposals now expect close to 67 cents. 
</P>
<P>
* Bondholders first forced Resorts International into bankruptcy and then 
expedited the company's reorganization, saving time and costly fees, after a 
fraudulent conveyance suit was threatened. The reorganization set up a 
$5-million fund to pursue a fraudulent conveyance suit against Donald J. Trump, 
who made $150 million in the sale to Merv Griffin. Creditors may also ask the 
courts to force Trump to turn the Taj Mahal casino back over to Resorts. 
</P>
<P>
* Earlier this year, Texas Air Corp. agreed to pay $280 million to bankrupt 
Eastern Air Lines, which it took over in 1986. Eastern labor unions had filed 
suit, and the bankruptcy examiner found that Texas Air may have illegally 
transferred more than $400 million of Eastern's assets. 
</P>
<P>
* In a settlement that eventually led to Coleco's sale to Hasbro Inc., 
unsecured creditors who had been owed $420 million triumphed in a $71-million 
fraudulent conveyance claim against secured lenders who had helped finance 
Coleco's LBO. 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, victims of failed LBOs are still waiting to realize benefits 
from their suits. This includes sufferers of asbestos-caused diseases who had 
thousands of claims against Jim Walter Co. and its Celotex subsidiary, a major 
producer of asbestos. The asbestos claimants sued in Texas after Jim Walter was 
taken over in an LBO led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., but they have 
made no progress since the company -- minus a newly spun-off Celotex -- was 
taken into bankruptcy in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Kaiser Steel Resources, the reorganized survivor of old Kaiser 
Steel, administrative costs and attorneys fees ate up most of the $27 million 
that Kaiser received in settlement of several claims relating to the steel 
company's sale. Former employees, who lost their promised lifetime medical 
benefits when Kaiser Steel declared bankruptcy in 1987, recently got a 
$3-million chunk of a settlement and are hoping future proceeds will help fund 
much reduced medical and pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers and bankruptcy negotiators have been closely watching the Kaiser 
fraudulent conveyance litigation, anticipating that upcoming decisions will 
influence the course of other such suits. 
</P>
<P>
Although many attorneys say settling such claims is in the best interest of the 
companies and creditors, they admit that they would like to see a few cases go 
through litigation. "Between the financiers, banks and bondholders, the selling 
and buying shareholders, who should bear the loss? These are important 
questions and they ought to be resolved," said Kenneth N. Klee, a noted Los 
Angeles bankruptcy lawyer involved in cases of Campeau Corp. and Resorts 
International. 
</P>
<P>
Before certain rulings were made in the Wieboldt case, much of the debate had 
concerned whether fraudulent conveyance statutes even applied to such modern 
transactions as takeovers and leveraged buyouts. The laws date back to 
Elizabethan England and were designed to cope with fairly simple situations. 
Suppose, for instance, that a financially strapped farmer on the verge of 
bankruptcy gave his possessions to friends or family members for little or no 
payment. With his assets parceled out, the farmer's bankruptcy would be all but 
assured. But his creditors -- butchers, bakers, landlords and the like -- would 
have no way of collecting from him. 
</P>
<P>
The Elizabethans declared that pre-bankruptcy deals in which assets changed 
hands without a fair-value exchange were "fraudulent conveyances." The butcher 
or baker who could prove that a fraudulent transfer of a debtor's assets had 
taken place could then, through the courts, force the family and friends to 
return the possessions, which then would be used to pay off the farmer's debts. 
</P>
<P>
In such cases, it was assumed that the farmer had intended to defraud his 
creditors. But as fraudulent conveyance statutes have been written in the 
United States, they have been expanded to cover such transfers regardless of 
intent. It is this "constructive" fraud -- where there may have been no intent 
to defraud -- that has been applied to many of the LBO cases. 
</P>
<P>
Wieboldt was the first significant constructive fraud case involving an LBO. 
Two important tests of whether the law could be applied to LBOs were met when 
the court found reason to support the creditors' claim that the company did not 
receive a fair-value exchange in the deal and that the complicated LBO 
financial transactions -- although seemingly separate -- were in fact all 
linked. 
</P>
<P>
According to attorney Wolosky, who represents two Wieboldt directors and an 
inside shareholder, if courts follow the reasoning of the Wieboldt case, 
fraudulent conveyance laws could be applied to "virtually every failed LBO." 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser Steel Resources is the fraudulent conveyance case now capturing the most 
attention. The reorganized company claimed that Kaiser was left insolvent by 
its sale in 1984 to a group led by Denver coal man Monty Rial and Tulsa 
businessman Joseph A. Frates. In 1985, Rial bought out Frates, who received 
additional payments and Kaiser property. 
</P>
<P>
While still under bankruptcy court protection, Kaiser began planning suits 
against officers and directors who approved the sale and firms that provided 
advice. Kaiser has already gained settlements with many defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser also sued Kaiser Steel's public shareholders -- those outside the 
company -- who accepted the buyout offer and the brokerages that handled their 
shares. The 10th Circuit Court in Denver has already upheld a lower court's 
dismissal of claims against the brokers, saying they were not parties to the 
transfer but merely conduits for the payments to shareholders. And the court is 
expected to dismiss claims against the public shareholders as well. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser's attorneys are already preparing a Supreme Court appeal. 
</P>
<P>
One of Kaiser's main contentions is that a failed LBO cheats a company's 
creditors because the shareholders got their money first, thwarting a 
well-established principle of corporate law. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Joseph L. Cosetti, chief bankruptcy judge in the Western District of 
Pennsylvania and president of the National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges, 
said: "In priority, generally speaking, common shareholders are at the bottom. 
Secured creditors are first, then unsecured, then shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser President Daniel Larson said it is a question not so much whether there 
was intentional wrongdoing by the public shareholders but of who should be paid 
first. "It's always been the creditors," he said, "and if the shareholders get 
paid first, those are ill-gotten gains whether there was intent (to defraud) or 
not on the part of the shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Constructive fraudulent conveyance: A transfer, or sale, can be ruled a 
constructive fraud if it is determined that the company resulting from the 
buyout received less than a "reasonably equivalent" value for the payments it 
made to shareholders and meets one of the following criteria: It became 
insolvent because of those payments, was too cash-poor to conduct its regular 
business or was taking on debts that it couldn't pay as they came due.
