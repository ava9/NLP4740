For the millions of Americans who want to make a fortune overnight, toy maker 
Milton Bradley and real estate tycoon Donald J. Trump will soon allow them to 
negotiate blockbuster deals in their living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, the flashy billionaire who recently published the autobiography "Trump: 
The Art of the Deal," is now the subject of a new $25 board game, "Trump the 
Game," Milton Bradley announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
The game, which will go on sale in the spring, is patterned after Monopoly and 
Trump's own career. Trump's well-publicized face, which was recently on the 
cover of Time magazine, appears on the game's play money, board, outer box and 
Trump cards. 
</P>
<P>
In the game, players compete to buy eight lucrative real estate properties such 
as hotels, casinos or convention centers with play money starting in 
denominations of $10 million. Trump said he has lost the game a few times 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"The game is based on the high stakes world of wheeling and dealing and 'The 
Art of the Deal,' " Milton Bradley President George Ditomassi told reporters. 
The toy maker, a unit of Hasbro Inc., also makes the games "Life," "A Question 
of Scruples" and "Win, Lose or Draw." 
</P>
<P>
"I really like the game," said Trump, who rolled 14-karat gold dice at a 
ceremonial "closing of the deal" in Manhattan's sumptuous Trump Tower. "It's 
much more sophisticated than Monopoly, which I've played all my life." 
</P>
<P>
Trump's percentage of the game's profits, which he did not disclose, will go to 
charities such as cerebral palsy, AIDS research and help for the homeless, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the game makes many millions of dollars," said Trump, who owns the 
Plaza Hotel, Trump Tower, Trump Plaza and Grand Hyatt in Manhattan, and Trump 
Plaza &amp; Casino in Atlantic City.
