The damage that Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. may suffer from criminal charges 
began to spread Tuesday as New Jersey gaming officials asked the state's Casino 
Control Commission to bar the investment firm at least temporarily from doing 
business with Atlantic City casinos. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel estimates that it has provided 70% of the long-term financing for the 
New Jersey gaming industry since casino gambling started in Atlantic City in 
1979. Most of the financing was provided through the sale of high-yield, 
high-risk "junk bonds." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, Nevada's top gaming regulator said in an interview 
that his state's authorities also are examining Drexel's suitability as a 
lender to casinos. But he declined to predict whether Nevada will take any 
action. 
</P>
<P>
In papers filed Tuesday with the New Jersey casino commission, Anthony J. 
Parrillo, director of the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, said he 
was seeking to ban Drexel from financing any casino deals because of the six 
criminal charges filed against Drexel by the U.S. Attorney's Office in 
Manhattan on Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Parrillo asked for the ban while a review is completed of Drexel's November, 
1987, application for a casino service industry license, which is required of 
companies doing business with casino operators. Under New Jersey law, 
applicants normally may continue to conduct that business while their 
applications are pending. But Parrillo said the right can be revoked if the 
firms are accused of serious crimes. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Parrillo said Tuesday's action was "designed to effect 
a severance of Drexel from casino business in New Jersey" until the criminal 
case is disposed of and the state's license application has been fully 
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel also is heavily involved in financing the gaming industry in Nevada. Its 
combined financing of purchases, construction or reorganizations of Las Vegas 
and Atlantic City casinos is estimated at $5 billion. William Bible, chairman 
of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, said in an interview that the board was 
collecting information on the pending criminal and Securities and Exchange 
Commission charges against Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Bible said the Nevada board's review was in connection with Interface Group 
Inc.'s application for a license to operate the Sands hotel-casino in Las 
Vegas. Drexel provided much of the financing for the Massachusetts-based 
company's recent purchase of the Sands for $110 million. 
</P>
<P>
Bible said that if the board finds Drexel an unsuitable lender in the Sands 
deal, it would "send a message" that the board might not approve similar deals 
involving Drexel. But he said he didn't know yet if such action was likely. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel is expected to plead guilty to the six federal criminal charges in New 
York as soon as it completes talks with the SEC on settling separate civil 
charges of stock market manipulation and defrauding clients. Criminal 
indictments are expected to be filed against junk bond king Michael Milken and 
several other Drexel employees. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the fallout from Drexel's decision to plead guilty to criminal charges 
has been relatively mild. The New York City government and the state of 
Wisconsin banned the firm from participating in the sale of a small number of 
new issues of municipal bonds. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. 
barred the firm from underwriting junk bond issues to bail out insolvent Texas 
savings and loan institutions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increased Market Share 
</P>
<P>
And one prominent corporate client of Drexel's, Stone Container Corp., 
reportedly has said it is unlikely to hire Drexel again to bring to market new 
issues of securities because of the criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
But the overall effect on Drexel's profits is believed to be negligible. 
Despite the publicity surrounding the investigation of the firm, last year it 
increased its dominance of the hugely profitable junk bond business to a 42.8% 
share of the market from 40% in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't clear whether the New Jersey action or possible action in Nevada 
might have a more significant effect on the firm. A Drexel spokesman declined 
to say how much profit the firm has earned from its investment banking services 
to Atlantic City casino companies. But the documents filed by New Jersey gaming 
officials state that the firm has earned fees "in excess of $120 million" over 
the past 10 years from the companies. If so, that would represent only a tiny 
portion of Drexel's profits. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Drexel noted Tuesday that the firm would be granted a 
hearing by the New Jersey commission before it acts on Parrillo's request 
within the next few weeks. The firm said that "since Drexel has provided more 
than $2.5 billion of capital -- 70% of all permanent funds raised -- for the 
New Jersey gaming industry, we know that public confidence and trust in the 
regulatory process is essential." 
</P>
<P>
Drexel said that, based on new procedures it will be implementing on its own 
and because of the current negotiations with the SEC, "we believe that we will 
be able to qualify for licensure shortly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reversed Position 
</P>
<P>
Parrillo declined to estimate how long the full review of Drexel may take. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel initially balked at New Jersey gaming authorities' request that it apply 
for a license. The firm originally had maintained that it wasn't required to do 
so under New Jersey law. But it reversed its position in 1987 and filed an 
application. 
</P>
<P>
Among the big deals that Drexel has helped finance in Atlantic City were Golden 
Nugget Inc.'s construction of a casino in 1980. Since then, Drexel has been 
involved in many transactions, including marketing securities worth more than 
$1.3 billion to finance Holiday Inns Inc.'s casino ventures, and securities 
worth $325 million in 1988 to finance Griffin Resorts Inc.'s acquisition of 
Resorts International Inc.
