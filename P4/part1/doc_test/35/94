INDIAN Railways has enough track to wrap twice around the Earth and enough
red tape to entangle a considerably larger planet. However, it remains an
extraordinary way to explore the subcontinent - warts, beauty spots and all.
There are several options for the rail enthusiast. The first is simply to
turn up in Delhi or Bombay and book each leg of your journey as the fancy
takes you. This provides maximum flexibility but will thrust you into the
heart of railway bureaucracy. You will need a timetable (Trains at a Glance,
available all over India) and the patience of Mother Teresa.
Securing a reservation is always a problem. Try to go to the station at
least a few days in advance; if nothing is available, ask if there is a
tourist/VIP quota, or speak to the station superintendent. As a last resort,
buy an unreserved ticket for any class, get on the train and ask the
conductor about unclaimed reservations.
The hierarchy of carriage-classes is matched only by that of India's
stratified social structure. With few exceptions, what you want are first
class air-con or ordinary first class tickets for mail or express trains.
Anything else is likely to be very cheap, very slow and very uncomfortable.
Sleeper carriages are more spartan than in Europe; bedding is available but
you will need to ask for it. Better still, take a sheet sleeping bag.
An alternative to tackling this railway obstacle course unaided is to seek
the advice of Dr Swaminath Dandipani, who runs S D Enterprises (tel:
081-903-3411) from a small office in Wembley, west London. Dr Dandipani is
the sole UK agent for Indrail passes which facilitate unlimited nationwide
travel, including sleepers. A seven-day first class pass costs a humble
Pounds 77; 15 days is Pounds 94; 90 days: Pounds 274.
Dr Dandipani, who claims to have memorised the entire Indian rail timetable,
will sort out an itinerary with you. All reservations are telexed through
from London and neatly laid out on a computer printout. By all accounts the
system is remarkably efficient. Dr Dandipani's service includes a list of 20
or 30 practical tips, including a reminder to take your own toilet paper and
to drink 20 glasses of purified water a day.
The third option is to book a complete tour. Butterfield's Railway Tours
(0262-470-230) has operated for 17 years, using its own refurbished carriage
which is attached to local trains. The carriage, which accommodates up to 26
people, comprises two sitting rooms, a dining room, kitchen, washrooms and
lavatories. There is even a library. Roy Butterfield, who runs the Yorkshire
office, describes it as a 'home from home', but insists his company provides
a true picture of the subcontinent, shunning the more westernised version
favoured by some operators.
Butterfield's runs two itineraries: the Great Indian Railway Tour, which
covers, in a breathless 21 days, the 3,000 miles between Delhi and Cochin
via Agra (for the Taj Mahal), Lucknow, Hyderabad, Bangalore, and a host of
other cities and costs Pounds 775, flights not included; and, more leisurely
and luxurious, the South India Tour from Madras to Bombay, which works out
at Pounds 1,750 all inclusive.
More upmarket still are tours offered by Cox &amp; Kings (071-931-9106). The
Palace on Wheels, a sort of rolling re-enactment of the Raj, is run by
Indian Railways and takes in the justly-famous sights of Rajasthan. The
one-week schedule, which allows little time for exploration, costs Pounds
595, flights not included. Cox &amp; Kings runs its own trip from Delhi to
Calcutta on express trains, with stops including Agra, Gwalior, and
Varanasi, the holy city on the Ganges. All-inclusive price: Pounds 1,455.
Cox &amp; Kings and other operators, such as Abercrombie &amp; Kent (071-730-7795),
will organise bespoke tours incorporating train journeys. You might consider
routes such as Quilon to Madurai, which starts on the humid Kerelan coast
before climbing into the cool Cardamom hills; the toy train up to Ooty hill
station (where snooker was invented), or the narrow-gauge Darjeeling
Himalayan Railway. The latter is especially unreliable, but then that is
half the fun.
