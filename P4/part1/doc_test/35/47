Devout followers of art do a good bit of grumping these days about the ways 
their sacred objects are being used. Junk bond traders use art to gain cultural 
prestige. Corporations finance luster-lending exhibitions. Right-wing 
legislators threaten to sanitize the National Endowment for the Arts. Art, in 
short, is being transformed from a garden of cultural insight into a political 
plow. 
</P>
<P>
A remarkable exhibition opening today at the County Museum of Art proves -- if 
it is any comfort -- that this is not the first time art has been put to work 
to tart up someone's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, on view to Nov. 15, is called "Timur and the Princely Vision" 
and concerns Persian art and culture in the 15th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibitions about the Middle East tend to get Westerners balled up on account 
of current hostility and ignorance, plus real historical complications, all 
compounded by changes in scholarly convention. The lands that used to be known 
as Persia are now roughly encompassed by Iran. The tyrant here called Timur 
might be more readily recognized by his old occidental handle: Tamerlane the 
Great, or sometimes Tamerlane the Lame. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, him. Sure, I knew it all the time. He was the most awesome conqueror of the 
Middle East after his own hero Genghis Khan. 
</P>
<P>
Timur -- born in 1336 -- came roaring out of Transoxonia with his 
Turco-Mongolian hordes pillaging and plundering until he controlled an empire 
that gobbled up all of what is now Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq and chunks of 
India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, China and the U.S.S.R. 
</P>
<P>
Timur used terror systematically. One favorite trick was to mass the skulls of 
thousands of victims into huge columns outside the gates of cities he wished to 
impress. 
</P>
<P>
Decidedly not a nice guy, but a charismatic leader capable of unifying factions 
and a shrewd politician who used the arts to impress the rubes, mollify the 
opposition and, naturally, glorify his glorious self. 
</P>
<P>
This cultural manipulation is what the exhibition is all about, and it is a 
first. Put together by LACMA curator Thomas Lentz and Glenn D. Lowry, curator 
at the Freer and Sackler Galleries in Washington D.C., it is an understated 
triumph of organization. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone expecting to be bowled over by gallons of gold and cornucopias of 
precious stones as they walk into the exhibition should be forewarned. In the 
first place, the most grandiose Timurid art is its architectural monuments such 
as the sanctuary dome of the masjid-i jami of Timur in Samarqand, which can be 
shown only in photographic murals. In the second place, this is one of those 
revelatory pieces of scholarship whose very fine catalogue is a virtual must 
for getting the best from the show. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition includes stunning objects such as Chinese-style jade cups and 
sections of architectural mosaics, but the largest number of works are 
drawings, calligraphic sheets and illustrated manuscripts that include some of 
the greatest known examples. Artistic pleasure here comes from such rarefied 
masterpieces as a bookbinding as delicate as lace where silhouettes of plants 
and animals have been cut from a single piece of leather. That's just a trick, 
of course, as is the calligraphic page where microscopic arabesques are 
individually cut from paper. What makes them work is an exquisite sense of 
refinement that turns work after work into delicate visual poetry akin to 
patterns in a kaleidoscope. 
</P>
<P>
Such attenuated elegance did not represent Timur's personal taste, which tended 
to run to powerful candlesticks the size of cannon and Koran pages as big as 
pup tents. One hapless artist made Timur the Islamic version of the New 
Testament engraved on the head of a pin and he drummed the poor chap out of 
court. Who needs this little-bitty stuff? We need something huge to awe the 
plebes. The Trump Mosque. 
</P>
<P>
There were buildings aplenty and luckily Timur's vision was better than his 
taste. He needed the fealty of his Islamic subjects and so incorporated their 
literature, poetry and beliefs. He established Kitabkhana -- royal libraries or 
workshops that became the centers of art, literature and learning. (Many a 
Timurid noble paid pious patronage and lip service to Islam while violating 
most of its codes in private.) 
</P>
<P>
Timur introduced elaborate ritual codes into courtly ceremonies all designed to 
enhance his own awesomeness. Court etiquette was so complex that visitors had 
to be manhandled through the ceremonies to make sure they groveled correctly. 
This sense of convoluted correctness comes across in an art so intensely 
stylized it is a wonder it is often as fine as it is. 
</P>
<P>
Timur died in 1405 at age 69. Without his leadership the empire came unglued, 
potential successors scrapping bloodily. When the dust settled the emergent 
leader was called Shahrukh. Until 1447 he ruled over an empire that was as 
fragmented within as it was opulent without. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly the empire eroded into the kind of dalliance that is bad for politics 
and terrific for art. Manuscript illuminations and scalpel-sharp drawings tell 
the story in their style. They depict a world of disembodied pleasure where 
concubines loll in patterned rose gardens while the prince hunts, composes 
poetry, studies the Koran or consults his astrologer. (The stars were taken 
seriously. One prince drank himself to death after receiving a bad horoscope.) 
</P>
<P>
The pictures may seem unreal but they are the precise metaphor of the reigning 
ideal of the princely world -- separate, private and luxurious. As time wore 
on, cultural refinement held such sway that reputations were made and broken 
with literary quips and elaborate word games. During one of these literary 
jousts a noted social arbiter and wit became simultaneously annoyed at a door 
that was banging in the wind and another guest who was just as noisy. The wit 
asked someone to bolt the door. When the man rose to comply the wit said, "I 
meant to bolt it from the other side." 
</P>
<P>
There is a kind of predictability to histories of crumbling empires. As the 
Timurids lost yet more power they had to cultivate the good will of religious 
men, and we see a series of paintings of bedizened nobles visiting hermit 
monks. As things got even more out of hand there was a Reagan-style revival of 
The Good Old Days where Timur is depicted as the great hero -- the George 
Washington of his day, strong and wise. The paintings are as magnificent as 
their motive impulse is sentimental. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the ferocious Uzbeks became belligerent in 1507, former Timurid 
boldness had given way to refinement. The empire was done for. Or was it? 
Timur's manipulative and eclectic artistic program turned out to be his 
greatest legacy. It set a standard for urbane refinement that held sway through 
four Turkish dynasties from the Uzbeks to the Mughals. Timurid aesthetics were 
so widespread that they mark one of the world's most fabled palaces. We think 
of the Taj Mahal as quintessentially Indian. As the show's curators whisper 
enticingly: "Hey, folks, the Taj Mahal is a Timurid-style building."
