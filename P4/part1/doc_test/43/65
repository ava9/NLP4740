Growing up, trumpet and fluegelhorn player Stacy Rowles was jazzed early on. 
Her father, pianist Jimmy Rowles, played host to a steady stream of famous 
visitors at their home in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
"Ben Webster used to sit me on his knee when I was 4. Billie Holiday held me 
when I was 6 months old," said Rowles, who takes the stage with her father at 8 
p.m. Friday and Saturday at All That Jazz, the new club adjoining the Wall St. 
Cafe in Rancho Bernardo. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Rowles is 72 and in precarious health. He seldom plays clubs, so this is 
a rare opportunity to hear an authentic original who came up in the big bands 
of Benny Goodman, Woody Herman, Tommy Dorsey and Bob Crosby. He went on to 
accompany such great singers as Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1960s, Rowles spent a good portion of his time working on movie 
soundtracks before going back to jazz full-time in the mid-'70s and building on 
his reputation for Ellington-inspired piano work on a variety of compositions 
by the Duke and his associate, Billy Strayhorn. 
</P>
<P>
Rowles has recorded as a leader and with Stan Getz, Zoot Sims, Ray Brown, 
George Mraz and others. He's been up for a Grammy five times, including a 
nomination for his 1982 solo piano album of music by Ellington and Strayhorn. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his daughter's career is picking up steam. Stacy Rowles' resume is 
almost as extensive as her father's, including work with bandleader Herman, Joe 
Pass, Marian McPartland, Red Callender and Tommy Flanagan. In September, she 
toured Europe with the Jazz Tap Ensemble and during October, played several 
dates in France. 
</P>
<P>
She alternates between fluegelhorn and trumpet. She likes the rich, velvety 
sound of the fluegelhorn, and when she plays trumpet, she usually tempers its 
bite with a mute. She names Freddie Hubbard, Clark Terry, Art Farmer and Chuck 
Mangione as influences. 
</P>
<P>
Her last album "Looking Back," released a year ago, includes her father plus 
Donald Bailey on drums and Eric Von Essen on bass. 
</P>
<P>
Rowles said she expects this weekend's fare to consist primarily of standard -- 
"jazz standards, not pop, rooted in be-bop. Dad has such a great knowledge of 
tunes that he has written me a beautiful library of tunes you just don't hear 
anymore, standards most people don't remember." 
</P>
<P>
Elario's makes a significant break with tradition this week by featuring fusion 
keyboardist Rob Mullins for five nights, beginning tomorrow. Actually, Mullins 
doesn't like to label his music, and considers himself a jazz player first and 
foremost, but this is the first time Elario's has headlined an electric jazz 
band with a commercial radio following in one of its prime five-night slots. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy playing a lot of different styles of music," Mullins said. "I'm sure a 
lot of people are going to come in and wonder, 'Can these guys play?' and 'Is 
this jazz?' We would say 'Yes' to both. The way that I look at jazz, I think 
it's still growing and didn't stop developing in the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a great amount of cultural diversity in America, and I try and draw on 
everything I've been exposed to. The first two albums I bought when I was 13 or 
14 were 'Big Swing Face' by Buddy Rich and the debut album by the Doors." 
</P>
<P>
Mullins said he has been most influenced by artists who are "great technicians 
but play with a lot of heart," naming Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea, McCoy Tyner 
and Bruce Hornsby. 
</P>
<P>
His newest album "Tokyo Nights" marks a return to electric jazz following last 
year's "Jazz Jazz," an all-acoustic album. At Elario's, his band will include 
former Crusaders saxman Wilton Felder plus bassist Dave Carpenter and drummer 
Joel Taylor. Mullins will play both acoustic piano and electric keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
Shows begin at 8:30 and 10 Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday nights and at 9, 
10:30 and midnight Friday and Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
Now settled in Portland, Ore., after a September move from San Diego, pianist 
Randy Porter teams up with fellow Portlander bassist Leroy Vinnegar and San 
Diego flutist Holly Hofmann this Friday and Saturday night at 8:30 at the 
Horton Grand Hotel downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Porter reports a lively jazz scene in Portland. He has already picked up 
regular work including Tuesday night date at a club called The Hobbit. 
</P>
<P>
Vinnegar, 62, is a polished player and composer. He has recorded several albums 
of his own and played on many others, including the incredibly popular late 
1960s album "Swiss Movement" with Les McCann and Eddie Harris. Vinnegar has 
never worked with Porter and Hofmann, so the music will consist primarily of 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: A recent article by this writer reported that Steve Allen wrote the song 
"South Rampart Street Parade." While Allen is multitalented, his publicity 
material exaggerated his credits a bit, as was pointed out by local musician 
and jazz critic Murray Davison. The traditional jazz number credited to Allen 
was actually penned by bassist Bob Haggart, a former La Costan. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Fluegelhorn player Burnett Anderson, the ex-Texan now in Daniel Jackson's Real 
Jazz Band at Croce's, which is featured at Croce's Monday nights, also plays 
with a trio on Friday and Saturday nights at La Maze in National City (1441 
Highland Ave.). . . . 
</P>
<P>
This Friday and next at 8 p.m., guitarist Peter Sprague and a few friends play 
jazz at The Roxy restaurant in Encinitas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Hollis Gentry takes a break from touring with guitarist Larry Carlton to appear 
Saturday nights at 8 during November in the Grant Lounge at the U.S. Grant 
Hotel downtown. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tobacco Road plays traditional jazz during its Thursday night "Let The Good 
Times Roll" shows this month beginning at 8 at Top of the Kingston, 1055 1st 
Ave. downtown.
