Blood Wedding (1933) is the earliest of the 'Spanish Earth' trilogy by
Frederico Garcia Lorca (1898-1936), preceding Yerma (1934) and The House of
Bernarda Alba (1935). Its violence is wedded to a surrealism that connects
Lorca and his other work to the wider influences of 1920s Madrid and the
specific influences of his friends Salvador Dali and Luis Bunuel.
The Lyric Hammersmith (with Odyssey Theatre) has now staged a fine, powerful
and unsettling production of the play by balancing its tragedy and
surrealism.
Lorca wrote Blood Wedding from a 1928 newspaper report of a Granadan bride
who eloped with her lover on the wedding night. Her family pursued them; the
groom and the lover killed each other. Behind the violence lie old family
vendettas, and above it surreal preternatural forces: blood, death, time.
Garcia Marquez used the same resonant themes in Chronicle of a Death
Foretold, set in a small Colombian pueblo.
The strength of the Odyssey Theatre's Blood Wedding comes from its
collaboration with Cumbre Flamenca. The music and dance fill out the
concentrated action on the large stage at the Lyric. The flamenco brings
mystery and intensity as well as authentic 'cante jondo' (deep song),
sadness and joy in a poised hand or a turned head. Ian Davies' fine guitar
accompaniment creates the atmosphere, conjuring a hot July in Granada from a
cold March in Hammersmith.
The play's surreal second part, where Death and the Moon preside over the
bride and her lover, is beautifully handled by Helen Turner's design and
Peter Mumford's lighting. The naturalistic hacienda interior of the opening
gives way to a vertiginous effect with columns of light and falling sand, as
if the stage itself was dropping away from gravity and reality towards the
strange benediction and coda.
Nigel Jamieson's direction lets each of Lorca's tense, unfinished scenes
engender the next, so the play develops rhythm and pace. The balance of a
Lorca scene can change quickly, so pared down is the writing. He wrote
strong parts for women, and the actors here respond well. Frances Tomelty
(substituting at short notice for Sofia Kalinska) as the groom's mother is a
stern, terse woman in a hard world, the crack in the strong voice with 'My
tears will come when I am alone.' Opposite her, Rosario Serrano as the
Mother-in-Law moves easily and expertly between song, dance and speech; and
Rosalind Bennett is a prim bride in black, a sexy lover, and a desperate
fugitive.
However, the patchy translation misses Lorca's visceral expression. 'Aren't
you happy with so many riches heaped upon you?' looks mannered alongside the
bleak picture of marriage elsewhere: 'A man, some children and a wall two
feet thick. Nothing more.'
