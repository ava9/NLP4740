'Woody affair' in perspective

WHEN WB Yeats wrote that the 'ceremony of innocence is drowned,' Woody Allen
was not in the poet's mind. But the words could be a copyline pasted onto
the latest showbiz scandal to shake the modern world.
'World' is not overstating it, nor is 'shake.' They talk of it in Italy,
where TV stations have been in a pother about showing Allen's series of
Italian supermarket commercials. They talk of it in France where l'affaire
Woody is taken as seriously as l'affaire Dreyfus. And in New York and Los
Angeles they talk of almost nothing else; though time out is sometimes
allowed for the Presidential election to be mentioned.
As for Britain, we will no doubt join the chat-wagon next week when Husbands
And Wives opens. This is Allen's supposedly semi-autobiographical account of
his relationship with Mia Farrow, already breaking up if we believe our
screens before all the talk of nude photos, affairs with youngsters and
video testimony.
As anyone knows who has followed this story, picking the facts from the
furore is about as easy - and as enjoyable - as taking the bones out of a
rabbit stew. Public knowledge stretches to the fact that Allen's longtime
girlfriend Mia Farrow blew the whistle on his affair with Farrow's adopted
daughter Sun-Li shortly after discovering nude photos of Sun-Li in Woody's
apartment.
If this had happened to any VIP other than a movie star, we might have had a
few week's statutory brouhaha and then the matter would have been ploughed
over by history. But scandals in the cinema have a special impact, for we
feel we know the performer as a friend. He or she struts before us, blown up
to a size where we can examine and approve every physical or moral pore. In
comedy this approval is crucial, since with rare sourpuss exceptions like
Groucho Marx and WC Fields the comedy star is an innocent who wins laughter
by straying into accidents.
What happens when they stray into the buckshot of personal scandal we know
from movie precedents no less momentous in their day than the Allen affair.
Silent comedy star Fatty Arbuckle was ruined by a rape case. Chaplin's
conjugal love life was impaled on the front pages when he defended cruelty
charges from his wife. (Inter alia, he was obliged publicly to defend oral
sex as a legitimate marital practice). And recently America's Pee Wee
Herman, cinema and TV's Mr Innocence to a generation of sub-teeners, was
arrested outside a Florida porn cinema and swiftly subjected to career
dismemberment.
Woody Allen, even in this company, is something special. More than a comic,
he has presented himself as a social philosopher: giving us highly-wrought
moral fables like September and Crimes And Misdemeanors. And not content
with the arm's-length lampoonery of early genre spoofs like Bananas and
Sleeper, Allen has more and more put his own life on screen, barely
transmuted in films like Annie Hall, Manhattan and Stardust Memories.
No wonder his fans were doubly scandalised when news broke of his affair
with a virtual foster-daughter, soon followed by other salacious rumours.
Those fans felt twice conned. First: for them Allen's acting persona had
always been that of a bug-eyed sexual incompetent. Second: no get-out clause
was available establishing that Allen the man was different from Allen the
movie-maker since his own life, not least his own love life and
actress-lovers, kept crowding up the screen.
We could say that the Allen scandal, subjected to tabloid microscopy and
impending video testimony, is just one piece in an expanding mosaic of
disillusioning exposes precipitated by our closed-circuit communications
world. What ever goes on today, in any room in the house called Planet
Earth, we can see it on the monitor. Fergie topless by the pool; Diana's
errant emotional life picked up by a radio ham; Rock Hudson's sexuality
rumbled by a state-of-the-art disease. Who can be innocent in a world with
such sleepless, sophisticated surveillance powers?
But it's a measure of Allen's own perverse honesty, as his career has
evolved, that he has presented himself and the world less and less as a
simple collision between primary forces: innocence (himself) and the
bewilderments of evil or of mature experience (the world).
As early as Manhattan Allen the 'innocent' was having a full-blown romance
with an under-age girl (Mariel Hemingway). A year later in Stardust Memories
Allen was a prickly film-maker snapping at his fans and juggling with three
love affairs, including another young girl (Jessica Harper). And as if the
shrugging off of sexual commandments was not enough, in Hannah And Her
Sisters we watched Allen shrug off God himself: boldly stepping into a
comedy of heresy where he tried and rejected every brand name in the
superstore of world religions.
More recently, September and Crimes And Misdemeanors were all about guilt,
and about modern man's agonised oscillation between honesty and concealment
in a world where the 'eyes of God' might have closed but where other eyes
keep eternal watch.
Yet we are still asked by many to believe that Allen's oeuvre is all about
knockabout innocence. For the professional moralists who shrill their
disappointment at a one-time idol's fall from grace, Moviedom's eternal
schoolboy has been caught doing naughty things behind the bike shed. Or
worse, that schoolkid has grown up without telling us and is now interfering
with other schoolkids.
But those who believe Woody Allen is an artist of innocence stopped watching
his films years ago, even if they technically saw them. They arrested time
in the late 1960s, circa Take The Money And Run, when they first fell in
love with a gesticulating human insect gifted with querulous one-liners.
They ignored the darker sexual shadings of Manhattan and Stardust Memories
and they shunned overwrought thinkfests like Interiors and Another Woman.
In some cases they have this critic's sympathy. Allen in earnest mood is not
the modern-day Ibsen he thinks he is. But equally he cannot be blamed for
presenting an 'innocent' persona when that persona was laid off years ago.
None of this would excuse Allen for being less than an 'innocent' in real
life. But then that is not the real charge movie fans are levelling for the
wound they feel he has inflicted on them. They believe that Woody Allen's
function and achievement was to go on providing them with ceremonies of
innocence: to spin an eternal childhood of lovable, stammering
incomprehension confronting a wicked, implacable world. For them that
ceremony of innocence has been drowned by the scandal. In cinema, once the
world's audiences have decided that an artist cannot grow up, he does so
only at his own, possibly terminal peril.
