If the leader of a young Minneapolis-area band was trying to be super-cool in 
his group's Los Angeles debut, he might throw in an overlooked Bob Dylan song 
or obscure Paul Westerberg tune to document his savvy rock tastes. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Gear Daddies' Martin Zellar augmented his own songs Thursday night 
at the Whisky with a well-known hit by Neil Diamond, a move that caused about 
half the audience to assume initially that it was a joke. No one has called 
Diamond hip in a long time and Minneapolis bands are known for sly, irreverent 
wit. 
</P>
<P>
But it was soon clear from Zellar's gently affectionate rendition of "Sweet 
Caroline" -- one of many wonderfully appealing songs Diamond wrote early in his 
career -- that he wasn't trying to be humorous. 
</P>
<P>
Zellar was, however, sending out a signal that the Gear Daddies are an 
independent bunch -- prone to take chances. And it wasn't the only sign in the 
40-minute set that suggested this is a band with integrity and vision. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't much flash about the group -- even by often anti-glitter 
college/alternative rock standards. They didn't attack the stage with a 
feverish intensity or play at break-neck, post-punk speed. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they performed the songs with a natural, almost back-porch demeanor 
that underscored the convincing observations about trying to sort out some of 
life's everyday complications. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweet Caroline" -- an endearing celebration of good times after some bad ones 
-- isn't the kind of song that Zellar would write. 
</P>
<P>
He tends to write songs that James Dean might have favored if he had ever led a 
rock group: lean, melodic, almost understated tales of wondering why you don't 
fit in and trying to figure out if you ever will -- tales that often involve 
fractured relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I feel sick and I feel used / You ain't the boy I thought I knew," he 
sings in one song. He adds in another, "I don't want to wear your crown / 
'Cause I'd only let you down." Yet elsewhere, he pleads, "Don't give up on me 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, a young band with a new, just-released album would make sure it 
crammed as many songs as possible from the album into its performance. Tours 
are designed to promote the album, right? 
</P>
<P>
But Zellar and the Gear Daddies -- whose soulful, stripped-down approach 
combines the softer moments of the Replacements with a bit of the country 
coloring of the early BoDeans' albums -- didn't concentrate on songs from the 
album. 
</P>
<P>
Opening for the far more energetic and much-admired Soul Asylum (whose latest 
A&amp;M album is a hit on the alternative-radio circuit and who'll open for the 
Pixies on Dec. 13 at the Universal Amphitheatre), the Gear Daddies came across 
almost as a tortoise in a rock world more accustomed to hares. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a growing yearning in the rock community for new voices and 
approaches, and this is a potentially great band -- one whose underlying sense 
of heart and craft may eventually make it one of the winners of the '90s.
