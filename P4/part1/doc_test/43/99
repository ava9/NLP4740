In most places without cable, Channel 3 on the television dial leaves you in a 
video void of white noise and static. 
</P>
<P>
That image had its appeal a decade ago for Mike Magrann and Kimm Gardener, two 
young punk rockers who grew up together in Cerritos. They dubbed their band 
Channel Three and began playing songs full of noisy commentary about some of 
the pictures in society, in the punk rock scene and in themselves that they 
thought needed adjusting. 
</P>
<P>
After a seven-year career that saw the release of three albums and two EPs, 
several national tours and considerable musical maturation beyond those dark, 
hollering hard-core punk beginnings, Channel Three went blank in 1987. But 
recent developments have prompted Magrann and Gardener to switch the picture 
back on, at least temporarily. Channel Three will stage a reunion show Friday 
night at Bogart's in Long Beach. They also will make a live television 
appearance Friday at 4:30 p.m. on the "Request Video" show on Anaheim-based 
KDOC Channel 56. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion for the reunion concert is the recent release of "Rejected," a 
wryly titled collection of demo recordings that Channel Three made from 1985 to 
1987 in a foiled bid to land a major-label contract. Released on Lone Wolf 
Records, a custom label owned by a Canadian fan of the band, "Rejected" is a 
welcome addition to the Channel Three file, full of boisterous, Rolling 
Stones-style rock and well-wrought lyrics by Magrann, one of the best musical 
storytellers to come out of the early '80s Southern California punk boom. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview this week in Magrann's apartment in Seal Beach -- a spacious, 
airy place with a skylight and contemporary, pastel decor upstairs; a shrine to 
Elvis Presley and assorted punk rockers in a small den downstairs -- the two 
Channel Three founders said they are not trying to jump back into the rock 'n' 
roll success sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
Magrann, who fronted the band as its singer, and Gardener, who played guitar, 
think it's fun that Channel Three has found a cult audience in Europe, where 
its early, hard-core recordings were released last year on a CD called "The 
Skinhead Years." They also are happy that two of their old punk anthems turned 
up recently on an episode of the television show "21 Jump Street." 
</P>
<P>
But Magrann, 29, and Gardener, 28, aren't keen about renewing their pursuit of 
a full-time rock 'n' roll career. Weariness with the careerist aspects of rock 
music caused Channel Three to break up the first time around. 
</P>
<P>
"It got so business-oriented that it just wasn't fun anymore," recalled the 
tall, deep-voiced Magrann, whose black hair sweeps upward in a modified version 
of a Presley pompadour. "That's part of the reason we drifted apart. When it 
got to the point where the band was a deal to be offered to people and argued 
over the phone, it wasn't the band anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Channel Three had no trouble building a following in its early days on the punk 
scene, where it first emerged with shows at Orange County's early-'80s punk 
breeding ground, the Cuckoo's Nest in Costa Mesa. Channel Three's blazing-fast 
music and rebellious themes fit right in with what slam-dancing, stage-diving 
young audiences were looking for. But as time went on, Channel Three found 
itself in a dilemma faced by many of the early punk bands: should it keep 
playing hard and fast, thereby guaranteeing it a solid following, or should it 
follow the inner voices that said there must be more to musical life than 
hollered vocals and racing tempos? 
</P>
<P>
Channel Three's break with hard-core came when it shifted from Posh Boy 
Records, the label that first recorded such bands as T.S.O.L., Agent Orange, 
the Adolescents and Social Distortion, to Enigma Records. A 1984 EP, 
"Airborne," and the 1985 album "Last Time I Drank" were melodic hard-rock 
albums, not punk records. 
</P>
<P>
"They're both deleted," Magrann said. "We were more or less in confrontation 
with Enigma before ('Last Time I Drank') even came out, which does wonders for 
your marketing. They were expecting to take over a punk band which was a proven 
seller. We wanted to experiment." 
</P>
<P>
The experimentation continued with the tapes now collected on "Rejected." 
Originally inspired by the Ramones' breakneck pop, the members of Channel Three 
became interested in exploring such influences as the Rolling Stones, the Band, 
and country music. Magrann's creative writing studies at Cal State Long Beach 
came in handy as he crafted literate but unpretentious lyrics such as the 
half-funny, half-pathetic relationship crackup ballad "Gone Drinkin'." Several 
other songs honed in on a recurring theme that runs through all of Channel 
Three's releases -- the fear that life is going to grow stale and soggy as time 
goes on, making it hard to keep a youthful spark lit. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Three's shift in style made it a hard band to sell, said Steve Rennie, 
the former Avalon Attractions vice president who took over as the band's 
manager in the mid-'80s and tried unsuccessfully to sign it to a new recording 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they alienated some of the punk fans, and they weren't quite 
mainstream enough" for major labels, Rennie said. Maybe if Channel Three could 
have kept playing and recording for a few more years, Rennie suggested, it 
could have caught the same wave that has elevated Social Distortion from a 
former cult band for hard-core punks to mainstream-contender status. 
</P>
<P>
"People were saying, 'Is it a punk band, or is it a rock 'n' roll band?' 
recalled Gardener, who still wears punkish spikes in his long, reddish-blond 
hair. "If we had waited three years down the line, the timing would have been 
better." 
</P>
<P>
The two Channel Three founders, friends since second grade, don't see their 
reunion as the start of another all-out attempt to land a recording deal and 
revitalize their rock careers. 
</P>
<P>
Gardener and Magrann both said they are happy with less ambition-driven forms 
of music making. Besides working a daytime job in a metal shop, Magrann knocks 
out blues and rockabilly sets with a band called Blue Diamonds, which sometimes 
appears at the cozy Sunset Pub in Sunset Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Gardener, a manager for a La Palma computer company, played in a band called 
Bulldog until a year ago. Now that he is out of the rock scene and no longer 
has to devote time to booking shows and paying attention to band business 
affairs (a role he played in Channel Three), Gardener said he has the time to 
polish his guitar technique by taking lessons. Both former punkers are engaged 
to be married. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Magrann and Gardener, the Channel Three lineup for the show at Bogart's 
features Ron Wood (the last of the band's 11 drummers), guitarist Mike Dimkich, 
who played bass in the final incarnation of Channel Three, and bassist Alan 
Bloch, late of Concrete Blonde, who is filling in for longtime member James 
Lansford, who last year moved to West Germany to work for a record company. 
</P>
<P>
Magrann and Gardener said that Lansford, who co-wrote the songs on "Rejected," 
has suggested doing a new album for his German label, and perhaps staging a 
Channel Three tour of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of talk," said Magrann. "The possibility of recording in the 
future seems real attractive, because we all have tons of songs ready to go. 
Promoters are calling. It's apparently a valuable commodity now. But if 
anything comes, it has to be on our terms." 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't see that the end of the rainbow is driving around in a van for 10 
months of the year," Gardener said. "We did that." 
</P>
<P>
Channel Three, Rhythm &amp; Booze and the Cause play Friday at 9 p.m. at 
Bogart's in the Marina Pacifica Mall, 6288 E. Pacific Coast Highway, Long 
Beach. Tickets: $10. Information: (213) 594-8975.

 PUNK FLASHBACK: Frontier Records will finally issue a CD version of "The 
Adolescents," the bracing debut album by one of the key bands of the Orange 
County punk-rock boom. The release is scheduled for next month, according to 
label head Lisa Fancher. It is part of a CD-reissue program for Frontier, with 
distribution through its major-label partner, RCA/BMG. Regrettably, the late, 
lamented Pontiac Brothers won't be part of the CD reissue effort, because their 
first two Frontier albums, "Doll Hut" and "Fiesta en la Biblioteca," never sold 
more than a pittance when they first appeared, Fancher said. 
</P>
<P>
GOSPEL OF THE BLUES: Borrowing a chapter from the Cowboy Junkies, who recorded 
their acclaimed album "The Trinity Sessions" in a church, Huntington Beach 
bluesman Robert Lucas is going to record his first full-length album live in a 
cathedral in Montecito, near Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, who sings and plays guitar and harmonica, will be accompanied by bass, 
mandolin and violin in the sessions, which are scheduled for July 1 through 3. 
The album will be released this fall by AudioQuest, a new label that is an 
offshoot of a San Clemente-based maker of high-tech sound components geared for 
the audiophile market. Lucas will be playing solo shows every Tuesday night 
through July and August at Takao in San Clemente, and every Thursday at 
Cagney's in Huntington Beach.
