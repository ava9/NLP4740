HANSEN STILL LICENSED BY STATE BOARD

The banning of jockey Ron Hansen by Golden Gate Fields last Sunday apparently 
was the result of an investigation into Bay Area racing that began about a 
month ago when two Las Vegas race books suspended betting on Bay Meadows 
thoroughbred races after recorded losses estimated at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
The two books, at the Stardust and the Desert Inn, said they had noticed 
unusual betting patterns on races, and Scotty Schettler, manager of the book at 
the Stardust, said, "I'd rather book wrestling than racing from Bay Meadows." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen's case is complicated. Although he has been banned from competing at 
Golden Gate -- under what race tracks generally refer to as the exclusion rule 
-- he is still licensed by the state racing board. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen's attorney has asked the racing board to issue a stay order, which would 
suspend Golden Gate's action and enable Hansen to ride there, pending a 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Stetson, a racing board investigator, said Wednesday that the board is 
trying to determine whether it has jurisdiction to review an order issued by a 
track's management. The Golden Gate stewards, who are responsible to the racing 
board, have not issued a ruling against Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
Since signing the ban against Hansen that went into effect Sunday night, Peter 
Tunney, the track's general manager, has declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne McDonnell, Hansen's agent, has called the ban "the biggest joke I've ever 
heard." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen, 30, who has averaged almost 220 thoroughbred winners a year for the 
last seven years, rode 147 in the 109-day season that ended Jan. 22 at Bay 
Meadows, another Bay Area track. Hansen also was the leading rider early this 
season at Golden Gate with 18 winners. 
</P>
<P>
Several attempts to reach Hansen, McDonnell and Hansen's attorney were 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen, a native of Logan, Utah, rode his first winner in 1976 in Idaho. He was 
voted the top apprentice in Canada in 1978, when he finished third among North 
American apprentices in wins. 
</P>
<P>
He was Canada's leading rider in 1979 and 1980 but failed in an attempt to 
crack the tough Santa Anita-Hollywood Park-Del Mar circuit in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
He has been successful almost everywhere else, though. He was the leading rider 
at Pomona for four consecutive years and has been among the leaders at 
Sportsman's Park in Illinois, Canterbury Downs in Minnesota and Longacres near 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
When Russell Baze, the perennial Bay Area riding champion, moved to Southern 
California, Hansen became his successor, winning 111 races at Bay Meadows in 
1988 and '89 and riding Simply Majestic to three stakes victories at Golden 
Gate. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, Hansen has won at least 207 races a year. His best year was 1989 
when he had more than 230 wins and purses worth $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The banning of Hansen is the latest in a series of problems at Bay Area tracks. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1988, Tony Diaz, a six-time Bay Meadows riding champion, was 
caught carrying an electrical prod -- known as a battery -- after winning a 
race at the San Mateo track. Diaz was given a two-year suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Early last year, jockey Bryan Campbell reported that jockey Doug Schrick had 
offered him $1,000 to lose a race. The racing board has suspended Schrick for 
10 years, and he also faces criminal charges for attempted bribery in a trial 
that began this week.
