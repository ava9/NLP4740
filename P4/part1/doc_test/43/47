THUNDERS TRIES TO ERASE DRUG-CLOUDED MEMORIES;

One of Johnny Thunders' leading claims to a place in rock history is a song 
called "You Can't Put Your Arms Round a Memory," the affecting lament of a man 
who knows that the deck in life and love is stacked against him. 
</P>
<P>
Erasing memories can be even harder than holding onto them. In Thunders' case, 
his audience's collective memory is full of images of an erratic performer 
known almost as much for his bouts with drug addiction as for the musical 
accomplishments in a career that began in the early 1970s with the influential 
glam-rock band, the New York Dolls. 
</P>
<P>
"If I live 100 years, it's going to be there," Thunders, 37, said of his 
reputation as a walking heroin casualty. But, speaking over the phone recently 
from Philadelphia, Thunders, who once put out an album called "Too Much Junkie 
Business," said that he has been straight since 1986. He described the 
Oddballs, the five-member backing band he has been working with for the past 
two years, as "the band that, when I'm 80, I'll remember as the one that was 
the most fun." 
</P>
<P>
Thunders hopes his current series of Southern California shows (including 
performances Sunday at the Coach House and Wednesday at Bogart's) will serve 
notice that he is out of the junkie business and deserving of a higher profile 
in the music business. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to think I had to take drugs to be happy and to play. I was so wrong," 
Thunders said. "I want to invite the music industry down to the shows. I'd 
really like to call 'em out. Come to a show, and I'll show you what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
Over the phone, Thunders seemed like a Dead End Kid arrived at middle age as he 
spoke in a worn voice that nevertheless was ready with a quip or a freewheeling 
opinion. The New York Dolls -- something of a rock-and-roll version of the Dead 
End Kids -- were a brash bunch of New York City rockers who got together in 
1971 and gained notoriety (if not wide success) with their androgynous look and 
a sloppy but boisterous raunch-rock sound inspired mainly by the Rolling 
Stones. 
</P>
<P>
Thunders was known as John Genzale when he was growing up in Queens. "I was 
going to be a baseball player," he said. "I made the varsity baseball team as a 
freshman. I was scouted by the L.A. Dodgers." He said his baseball career ended 
when "they told me to cut my hair and I (emphatically refused). I started a 
band then." 
</P>
<P>
With their lipstick, platform shoes and feather boas, the Dolls were part of 
the glam-rock movement of the early 1970s that aimed to shock with 
gender-bending appearances and behavior (Alice Cooper, David Bowie and Marc 
Bolan were others who did it with a good deal more commercial success). 
</P>
<P>
The band's rowdy, funny songs about life on New York's seamier side proved more 
enduring than its image, and the Dolls gained significance as a precursor for 
the punk-rock movement that came later in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the New York Dolls in 1975, Thunders and Dolls drummer Jerry 
Nolan formed a band called the Heartbreakers. Thunders launched his solo career 
in 1978 with a strong album called "So Alone." By 1981, he was being 
prematurely eulogized by the Replacements, whose 1981 debut album included a 
song called "Johnny's Gonna Die" in which singer Paul Westerberg expressed 
affection for Thunders, mixed with pity and anger over what seemed to be his 
imminent fate. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard it," Thunders said. But a few months ago, he shared a bill 
with the Replacements and Westerberg approached him. "The singer's a nice guy. 
The rest of 'em should read some books," said Thunders. "He told me he wrote 
this song, and told me some of the words." Thunders said he didn't have much of 
a reaction to what really is a remarkable song. "I was yawning, actually," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Thunders, however, sounds lively enough on "Copy Cats," a new album on which he 
shares billing with Patti Palladin, a fellow New Yorker based in London. The 
album features punchy cover versions of mostly obscure R&amp;B oldies, with 
Thunders using his thin, nasal voice to humorous effect with theatrical 
mannerisms. It's slightly reminiscent of his old Dolls partner David Johansen's 
popular new incarnation as Buster Poindexter, a comical lounge belter 
specializing in R&amp;B oldies. 
</P>
<P>
Thunders, who returned to New York City about a year ago after spending most of 
the '80s in France and Sweden, said that some of his new songs take a more 
serious, socially conscious tack. He eagerly began reciting the lyrics to a 
song he has written about homelessness. "I'm not one to lend my name to causes, 
but in justice I intercede," he began. "Hurting the hurt -- is this America? 
Tell me please." 
</P>
<P>
"I also have a new song about battered children called 'Children Are People 
Too,' " Thunders said, as well as a gospel song singing the praises of Jesse 
Jackson. "And I have one about critics called "I Tell the Truth Even When I'm 
Lying.' " A few months ago, Thunders said, an offer came through for him to 
join two other former New York Dolls, Jerry Nolan and Sylvain Sylvain, on what 
would have amounted to a nostalgia tour for the alternative-rock set. But he 
couldn't see trying to put his arms around that memory, especially with 
Johansen not involved. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was silly. I'd be a hypocrite if I did it. The only thing I've 
got is my music, so I can't see selling that out." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the Dolls will reunite in the year 2000, Thunders said jokingly. For now, 
he just wants to follow his own relatively modest goals. "As long as I can play 
and make records, that's all I want. I play to please my band and myself. If I 
can take kids' problems away for two hours, I did my job." 
</P>
