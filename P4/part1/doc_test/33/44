Global Warming: Are We Entering the Greenhouse Century? by Stephen H. Schneider 
(Sierra Club Books: $18.95; 336 pages; illustrated). 
</P>
<P>
If you are in the natural sciences, "global climate change" is just about the 
most exciting jingle -- and perhaps the hottest meal ticket -- to hit the 
catch-phrase circuit since "survival of the fittest." 
</P>
<P>
And well it should be. For once, a distinct majority of climatologists are in 
agreement about the weather prediction: It is -- as you well know unless you 
have been off the planet the last couple of years -- a warming trend. A rather 
quick one, with no end in sight. And with consequences for humanity and the 
remainder of the Earth's fellow travelers that threaten to be rather 
interesting. 
</P>
<P>
If I were forced to select but one chronicler for this new adventure we are 
undertaking, it would be Stephen Schneider. For a scientist he is too glib; for 
a journalist he is too technical. He has a leg firmly insinuated into each camp 
-- and that's no pedestrian accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider is head of "Interdisciplinary Climate Systems" at the National Center 
for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., a National Science 
Foundation-sponsored institution that has consistently been at the cutting edge 
of research and policy. 
</P>
<P>
A few years back, Schneider co-authored a book -- also published by the Sierra 
Club -- entitled "The Co-Evolution of Climate and Life" that offered a 
thrilling reconstruction of the Earth's past climates and the newly emerging 
science of global future climate modeling for those sufficiently brave to 
tackle a little chemistry and some complex graphs. Schneider wasn't afraid to 
say to his non-scientific readers, "Come on, work a little and I'll make it 
worth your while." And he was right. For serious fans of weather who have 
graduated from cumulus and occluded front, it's the best thing in print. 
</P>
<P>
The modest-appearing predicted increases of 3 to 5 degrees (Celsius) over the 
next century would be unprecedented in human history. The average increases 
obscure the way we will perceive climatic change: more heat waves, more 
droughts, more floods, more extreme weather. 
</P>
<P>
Today, scientific, public and -- belatedly -- governmental concern about the 
nature and consequences of "the greenhouse effect" is beginning to drive myriad 
research programs: If you are a climatologist, you are examining polar ice 
cores for evidence of past climates and the gas concentrations that accompanied 
them. You are using supercomputers to run increasingly complex models of ocean 
and atmospheric circulation and evaporation/condensation cycles that attempt to 
factor in changes in the Earth's potential for retaining the sun's heat. And 
you are looking at other anthropogenic greenhouse gases -- CFCs, ozone, oxides 
of nitrogen -- to try to figure how these may contribute to the equation in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
If you are an agricultural scientist, you may well be using the first uncertain 
maps predicting temperature zones and precipitation to estimate changes in the 
kinds of crops and their production that will take place in each region. 
Meanwhile, foresters are conducting parallel exercises for timber. 
</P>
<P>
If you are an ecologist, you are predicting the distribution of future natural 
plant communities, perhaps borrowing data that paleontologists are extracting 
from fossil pollen in lake bottoms on the kinds of vegetation that accompanied 
past climates, and how fast it could migrate with climatic change. 
</P>
<P>
Plant physiologists are attempting to calculate what stimulating effect 
increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide may have on plant growth, and the degree 
to which increased growth could then transfer carbon from the atmosphere to 
plant tissue reservoirs -- a negative-feedback or homeostatic loop. 
</P>
<P>
Conservation biologists, meanwhile, remind their colleagues that the biggest 
such carbon pool lies in the tropical rain forests, which are rapidly being 
converted back to CO2 (carbon dioxide) themselves, and wonder what the 
extinction price of global warming may be as thousands or millions of species 
discover their habitats are becoming less habitable and there is no place left 
to move. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanographers ponder what dimensions the oceans will assume as they expand 
with increasing temperature, and what additional volume may be added by melting 
polar ice caps. On the other hand, the enormous mass of the world's oceans may 
well absorb some of the greenhouse gases, and may act as a thermal ballast to 
slow atmospheric warming. 
</P>
<P>
Regional planners in some places are contemplating the redistribution of 
available water through changes in precipitation patterns, while those in 
places like San Francisco, New York, Calcutta, Holland or Indonesia nervously 
study the oceanographers' estimates of sea-level rise. 
</P>
<P>
The economists, of course, are beginning to add all of the potential costs and 
benefits together for each regional and national economy. And they are likewise 
starting to weigh the costs of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, which come 
mostly from the burning of coal, oil and wood, against the burden of global 
climate change. Sociologists wonder what these changes portend for people's 
lives, and the political scientists ponder future conflicts arising from 
economic or social dislocations. 
</P>
<P>
That's a taste of "Global Warming." Schneider is not certain of the greenhouse 
effect, but he's sufficiently convinced -- he provides the evidence that 
convinces him -- that he argues forcefully for investing in more research and 
better planning. And he is less than kindly toward bureaucrats and politicians 
who resisted such efforts during much of the past Administration. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of puzzles he leaves unresolved. For example, there is an 
excellent correlation in climatic record between past temperatures and levels 
of methane and carbon dioxide, but there are also mechanisms by which these 
gases could have been the product, rather than the cause, of higher 
temperatures. We are almost certainly in between periods of glacial advance and 
retreat. There is a link between global activity, but Schneider does not fully 
explain this as he summarizes the most popular theories of "intrinsic" 
(Earth-bound) and "extrinsic" (solar or orbital fluctuations) forcing of 
climatic change. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, this is an exceedingly complex-albeit fasinating-topic. The hottest 
years of the century have occurred in the 1980s. Are they the beginnings of the 
greenhouse or some other climatic process? 
</P>
<P>
Schneider tantalizes, but remembers his scientific credentials. He does observe 
that the best available analyses of global records dating back many decades do 
show a regular rise in temperature, but at only half the rate predicted by 
levels of the greenhouse gases. Does this invalidate the model? 
</P>
<P>
There is more. A little backpatting history of research and politics provides 
levening. A modest chapter suggests how we may mitigate and cope with the 
greenhouse century-chiefly by becoming more energy-efficient. 
</P>
<P>
And there are good footnotes and a good index. This is a complex book, but 
because Schneider clearly has the gift of gab and a touch of the prophet, it 
works and works well.
