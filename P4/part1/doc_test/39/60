<F P=106> [Report by "eli/mes": "Geissler Warns of Growing </F>
Nationalism"] 
  [Text] Heiner Geissler, acting chairman of the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU] faction, has issued a warning about 
increasing nationalism and a return to thinking in nationalist 
terms. In an interview with SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, he said that 
nationalist thinking has moved to the forefront since 
unification. But, he said, Germany's future lies not in the 
reestablishment of a national state, but in opening up to other 
ideas, and in the creation of a federal European structure. "A 
national state is too little for big things and too big for 
little things," he said. 
  With his statements, Geissler confirmed similar opinions by 
CDU politicians recently expressed at the traditional 
"Roemeberg" talks in Frankfurt. The CDU had reacted with some 
concern to these opinions because Wolfgang Schaeuble, 
CDU/Christian-Social Union [CSU] chairman, wrote in his book 
that the nation's thoughts must be filled with vitality to 
prevent society from drifting apart. Schaueble's book is to be 
presented by Chancellor Kohl this Monday [20 Jun]. 
  Geissler said that although he agrees with Schaueble that 
society is splitting up into groups, "nationalist feelings as a 
collective ethnic emotion cannot be considered the basis of 
collective responsibility. One must love one's neighbor, not 
one's people." 
  "The citizens of East Berlin and Leipzig did not create the 
revolution in 1989 to reestablish the nationalist state, but to 
push through democracy, freedom, and justice," Geissler 
continues. "But, in 1990, the center of gravity changed. 
Nationalist feelings moved to the forefront." Although equality 
and justice still form the mainstays of internal unity, "we will 
never attain them by means of nationalist feelings, but by means 
of a feeling of responsibility toward one's fellow man," said 
Geissler. 
  Geissler does not think the CDU is full of nationalist 
sentiment. "Were it not for Helmut Kohl, the situation would 
certainly have been more difficult," he says. Geissler does not 
think it is necessary to seek an identity in Germany. "That is 
an artificial task. Nationalist feelings are good only if they 
are premeditated and restrained. The idea of nationalism has 
been discredited, and rightly so. Nationalism is an ideological 
plague, just like fundamentalism, fascism, and communism." 
  Geissler calls for "unity, justice, and freedom, instead of 
Germany above all else. When the flag flutters in the air, 
one's mind lies in the trumpet that blows the fanfare," he says. 
"The patrons of the new Germany are not Kaiser Wilhelm or Otto 
von Bismarck, but Konrad Adenauer, Willy Brandt, Richard von 
Weizsaecker, and Helmut Kohl."
