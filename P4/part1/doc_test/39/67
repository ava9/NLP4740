<F P=106> [Report signed "tom/APA": "Klestil: `Not a Moment of Lone </F>
Action'"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Regarding Austria's membership in the 
European Union [EU], the Austrian people will be exposed to a 
serious test of their identity. It will also show their 
contradictory character. 
  On the one hand, the people are "European champions 
regarding 
patriotism." As many as 79 percent see themselves "solely as 
Austrians," no more than 17 percent "also as Europeans." On the 
other hand, only one-third of the citizens (two-thirds in 
Switzerland) believe that "their own political system is very 
good." One-third of the Austrians even find "their system" bad. 
  This information was given by university professors Fritz 
Plasser and Ernst Bruckmueller at the beginning of a symposium 
of the Industrialists' Association (IV) in Vienna on "Austria's 
Identity in a Larger Europe." The consequences are obvious for 
political scientists and historians. They say that there is 
remarkable "inner resistance" against the EU and against what is 
new. 
<H5>  Excessive Burden </H5>
  The European integration process calls the image Austrians 
have of themselves (culture, great scenery, but not quite the 
managerial skills of the Germans) into question and will lead to 
"an excessive burden on decisionmaking." 
  Against this background, outstanding individuals made 
statements in the discussion -- Cardinal Franz Koenig, Theo 
Sommer, publisher of DIE ZEIT and a former planning chief in the 
Bonn Defense Ministry under chancellor Willy Brandt, the 
historian Brigitte Hamann, director Helmut Felderer of the 
Institute for Higher Studies, and Polish Ambassador Bartoszewski. 
  President Thomas Klestil made his first comprehensive 
statement prior to the referendum and called upon Austrians to 
demonstrate solidarity. He said that this was "not the time of 
pursuing party politics or acquiring personal status at the 
expense of European policy." Nor was it "a test run" for 
parliamentary elections or a "reminder regarding problems that 
are not at issue." 
  The president said he wished to see "all those" gather "who 
are convinced of the urgency of a larger, common Europe" and 
form a "group of responsible and farsighted Austrians." In the 
postwar era, the Austrians in particular had proved to 
themselves and to the world that unity is strength. This had 
been demonstrated most recently in Brussels when the agreement 
was concluded. 
<H5>  Developing Tolerance </H5>
  Klestil said the Austrians did not have to be afraid of 
Europe, because "no other membership candidate has ever been 
better prepared than we." It should also be stressed that "we 
will not lose our identity." The "really great task" in the EU 
would be that Austria "will bring in the values of tolerance and 
the many colors of a multicultural society." 
  Industry Association secretary general Franz Ceska warned 
about "a strange mixture" of "fearfulness and pompousness." 
People should not let themselves be influenced by a feeling of 
uncertainty. However, EU membership was "indispensable" for the 
country's industry, he said. 
  Johannes Voggenhuber, spokesman for the Greens on EU 
affairs, 
on 30 May criticized the government once again for "making 
propaganda instead of providing real information." He said that 
copies of the membership treaties for the citizens were out of 
print. 
  Freedom Party secretary general Karl-Heinz Grasser spoke 
about attempts at blackmailing the citizens. "Regarding 
democracy," EU membership would be "a relapse into the 19th 
century."
