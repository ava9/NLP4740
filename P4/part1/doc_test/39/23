<P>
Less than one week before German unification, the East and West German Social 
Democratic parties merged into a single organization and pledged to help the 
new Germany "find its place in a peaceful Europe." 
</P>
<P>
When the two countries unite next Wednesday, the Social Democratic Party, or 
SPD, will be the largest opposition group to the conservative-led government of 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in December elections. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of more than 550 delegates at the SPD's reunification congress voted 
against the new party's rules. 
</P>
<P>
"Together we start work, so that for the first time in history Germany can find 
its place in a peaceful Europe," the party said in its new manifesto. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither national self-contentment nor even nationalistic exuberance are needed 
now, but rather solidarity of Germans among themselves," the statement said. 
"What is also needed is solidarity with the peoples of Central and Eastern 
Europe who are treading a new path, and with the majority of mankind, which is 
faced with bitter poverty," 
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt told the delegates 
that "Germany . . . needs social democracy."
