challenges ahead for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government

In the small hours of Germany's Monday morning, any normal political animal
would have been wide awake, frantically following every last election return
to determine the fate of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government.
Computer predictions put his overall majority at two seats, a cliff-hanging
result well within any normal margin of error. Only three-quarters of the
seats were counted by midnight, and most of the remainder were in
unpredictable territory in east Germany. On the face of it, it could have
gone either way.
But in Bonn, at midnight, most German political animals were in bed.
In the first place, Mr Kohl had said he had won, so they believed it.
Indeed, Mr Rudolf Scharping, the leader of the opposition Social Democratic
Party (SPD), had virtually admitted defeat. And secondly, they knew that
even a two-vote majority would not necessarily spell chaos and instability
in the German political system.
Long past bedtime, it emerged that the chancellor's conservative-liberal
coalition had actually survived with a 10-seat majority, a dramatic drop
from its lead of 134 in the outgoing parliament, but, in Mr Kohl's words, 'a
perfectly good working majority'.
Yesterday, the markets took it all in their stride. The Frankfurt stock
exchange put on an initial 2 per cent, before falling back later in the day
in 'muted' trade. The bond market was up. The atmosphere was relaxed.
But the political establishment was split down the middle over whether the
current coalition would survive its full four-year term.
'They won't even last a year,' Mr Rudolf Dressler, social affairs spokesman
of the SPD, said yesterday. 'There is no reason why they shouldn't survive a
full term,' said Mr Klaus Beck, head of the Bonn liaison office of the trade
union federation.
Everyone accepts that a tiny majority is not in itself a disaster. Former
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt survived with a 10-seat majority from 1976-1980,
and his predecessor, Mr Willy Brandt, had a 12-seat margin from 1969-1972.
The government of the north German state of Schleswig-Holstein has been in
power with a one-seat majority since 1992. There are no mid-term
by-elections, and German governments are anyway slow-moving, consensus-based
creatures, which avoid conflicts at all costs.
The trouble for Mr Kohl is that his coalition contains political strains
which have been under pressure for several years and the finely-balanced
election result could just bring them to breaking point. And the government
agenda in the coming four years is certain to include some issues that could
provide the material for deep divisions.
For a start, it must tackle the question of tax reform, of both income tax,
which is the chancellor's priority, and company tax. Another key question is
the soaring cost of the welfare state, and how to control it. Privatisation
and deregulation are also potentially divisive issues for the members of the
coalition. And so is the need to take tougher action to enforce law and
order, and cope with organised crime.
Only foreign policy looks to be an area of relative harmony.
Everything depends on the highly unpredictable Free Democratic Party (FDP),
the liberal minority partner in the ruling coalition, and the big loser in
Sunday's general election. It emerged from the poll with just 47 members in
the 672-seat Bundestag, compared with 79 in the previous parliament. But it
still holds the balance of power between Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats and
the opposition SPD.
The party, led by Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, has fought a string
of disastrous election campaigns during the year, losing all its seats in 10
state parliaments, and in the European parliament, because it failed to get
more than the required 5 per cent minimum share of the vote. In east
Germany, in particular, its philosophy of free market liberalism has failed
to find any response.
It scraped into the Bundestag on Sunday night, largely thanks to votes
transferred by CDU supporters. People who said they voted FDP as they
emerged from the polling stations were asked which party they really
favoured. No fewer than 63 per cent said CDU, compared with only 16 per cent
for the FDP itself.
The FDP is now the smallest member of the coalition - the Bavaria-based
Christian Social Union (CSU) has 50 seats. Yet the irony is that it is more
politically powerful, because of the paper-thin majority, than it was over
the past four years.
Mr Kinkel is totally committed to the current coalition. He fought the
entire election on that basis. But he knows that over the next four years he
has to win a clear political profile for his own party if it is to survive
the next election at all. The FDP has to take a clear, independent position
on issues. The question is whether it can best do that within the ruling
coalition, or outside it.
On tax reform, the FDP, the CDU and the CSU are not too far apart, although
the FDP is clearly more radical in the reduction it would wish to see in
company tax.
It is also more potentially radical on deregulation and privatisation. A big
issue for Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, has been the need to
make the energy market more competitive, and another has been to deregulate
the retail sector - both issues on which he has met solid opposition from
the more conservative CDU/CSU.
But the most potentially contentious area is social spending cuts, where the
FDP is also more radical than its more powerful partners.
'The dilemma of the FDP is that they will be tempted to try to get more
profile by being in the forefront of moves to deregulation and to slim the
welfare state,' according to one top political adviser. 'But they know first
of all that the CDU is much more cautious. And Mr Kohl knows that these are
issues on which he needs the support of the Bundesrat (the second house of
parliament representing the 16 federal states). The Bundesrat has an SPD
majority, and on such issues, he will never get that support. So he has to
resist the FDP.'
Social spending issues nearly brought disaster during the past four years,
first over reform of the health service, and then over setting up a new
insurance scheme to finance nursing care for the old and handicapped. The
FDP backed down, but next time, it might decide not to.
The other key area of contention could be law and order, for the FDP still
contains a strong libertarian wing, committed to generous immigration
policies, good race relations, and a determined resistance to police
surveillance, such as bugging telephone lines. Mr Kohl will be pushing for
tougher action on law and order, to fulfil his election promises.
Only on Europe are the coalition members in broad agreement, although Mr
Kohl is perhaps more passionate about the need for further European
integration.
But any of those issues could be the one the FDP chooses to use to seek a
new profile, if the party leadership decides that is the best strategy.
Mr Kohl, on the other hand, will bend over backwards to keep his coalition
together. He knows that the alternative - a grand coalition with the SPD -
was a disaster for his party before, when it paved the way for a change of
power to an SPD-FDP alliance. He will thus seek to accommodate the liberals,
within the limits of his need to work with the SPD majority in the
Bundesrat. That is where a de facto grand coalition already exists.
That is perhaps why the German body politic, and the financial markets, can
afford to be so relaxed about such a close election result. But it still
leaves the future clouded by uncertainty, and the fate of Mr Kohl in the
hands of his unreliable partner, Mr Kinkel.
