<F P=106> [Interview with President Richard von Weizsaecker by Gerhard </F>
Spoerl and Dirk Koch in Berlin; date not given: "Often We Were 
Not Ready To Risk Anything"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. President, are you an unorthodox 
thinker? 
  [Weizsaecker] I do not know what an unorthodox thinker is. 
The term is used in such a way that one could only choose 
between thinking and obeying. I do not consider this contrast 
very useful. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] According to Chancellor Kohl, an unorthodox 
thinker is a "very well disguised conformist." 
  [Weizsaecker] In that case, an unorthodox thinker would not 
be a thinker at all. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Does this mean that you did not assume that 
the chancellor's statement was addressed to you? 
  [Weizsaecker] Why should I? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Because it might have been addressed to you. 
  [Weizsaecker] There is no reason for that. We are not 
fixated on each other. We assume our joint responsibility in 
different roles, as is our duty. 
  [Weizsaecker] You have often expressed controversial views 
in your statements and speeches during your term of office. 
  [Weizsaecker] Thinking and adaptation do not belong 
together. Someone can adapt himself or contradict constantly 
without having any ideas of his own. Thinking is linked with 
the task of being and remaining independent. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Federal presidents mainly deliver speeches. 
Should they be given more power in the future? 
  [Weizsaecker] I do not consider this a major issue. We are 
living in a period of change after the end of the Cold War -- 
not only in Germany but in the whole world. The former rigid 
fronts that determined our thinking and actions no longer exist. 
We need a new orientation. Whoever can should contribute to 
this. It will have an impact, no matter what constitutional 
power he holds. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you advocate upgrading the president's 
office? 
  [Weizsaecker] It would not be a bad idea to strengthen 
suprapartisan elements in our constitution. The president's 
office might be enabled to submit proposals for nominations of 
judges of the Supreme Court, for example. It would be useful to 
provide the president with instruments that make it possible for 
him to discuss issues concerning the orientation of the liberal 
democracy with independent public figures and to submit 
proposals -- naturally without infringing the responsibility and 
the competence of the other constitutional bodies. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Despite the melancholy of the farewell, do you 
get an uneasy feeling when you look at the country's situation? 
  [Weizsaecker] Generally, we are going through a period of 
change -- in both parts of Germany, in united Germany, in 
Europe, and in other parts of the world. We are facing new 
opportunities, but it is also more difficult to find a path. 
This is a big challenge. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Complaints about too much narrow-mindedness 
and reluctance to carry out reforms are widespread. For 
instance, this applies to the relationship between the Germans 
and the foreigners living here whose naturalization is difficult 
and who are deprived of the right to vote. 
  [Weizsaecker] In this respect, too, we are living in a 
transition period. During the Cold War, the borders were 
largely closed for immigrants. Only citizens from the European 
Community were exempted. This has changed completely. Habits 
change in our country. This process cannot take place 
overnight, but progress is noticeable. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Does the required progress include the right 
of foreigners to dual citizenship? 
  [Weizsaecker] I remember an exemplary case from my term of 
office as Berlin mayor, which shows the importance of this 
problem. If young Turkish girls are born in Berlin who undergo 
vocational training and who prepare themselves for a life here 
and who have neither the intention nor the practical opportunity 
of returning to Anatolia, they will sooner or later have the 
desire to participate not only in the obligations but also in 
the rights of the citizens living here. At the same time, they 
live with their parents or grandparents who still know their 
home country and long to see it again, and who are often worried 
about he future of their daughters. It would be painful for 
them if their daughters would simply give up the citizenship of 
their ancestors. This should be prevented. 
  Is this understandable from a human viewpoint? Does it do us 
any harm if young Turkish girls hold both citizenships? I do 
not claim that one can generalize here. However, against the 
backdrop of a generalizing, rigid, and administrative tradition, 
we should also see specific human fates and adapt our rules in a 
more efficient manner to them than in the past. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are you satisfied with the implementation of 
the asylum law? 
  [Weizsaecker] What was particularly important was not to 
reduce and limit the immigration issue to the asylum issue, as 
we have done for a long time. Immigrants may include 
asylum-seekers, civil war refugees, resettlers from the former 
Soviet Union, or people who have other motives. Thus, not all 
possible immigrants are asylum-seekers. A discussion on this 
topic has been initiated. We will adopt rules that serve the 
goal of regulating immigration in accordance with our interests 
and obligations. This is what other countries with whom we have 
very close relations have been doing for a long time on the 
basis of their experiences. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You were opposed to amendments to the asylum 
law. Now you have had to sign an asylum law that practically 
abolishes the basic right to asylum. Does this tarnish your 
term of office? 
  [Weizsaecker] The constitutional idea embodied in the asylum 
law will be implemented more effectively once it is part of an 
overall immigration law. It is being drafted but has not yet 
been completed. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Why not? 
  [Weizsaecker] In no country in the world has the 
relationship between emigration and immigration changed so 
quickly within such a short period. We have accepted more 
people than any other country. Thus, we are in the middle of a 
longer public discussion to which I am also contributing. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are the Germans also learning from their 
neighbors how a relaxed nation should behave, as your successor 
Roman Herzog has suggested? 
  [Weizsaecker] In my view, this topic is not as serious as it 
sometimes seems in discussions. Every nation has its 
peculiarities. One of our special features is that, situated in 
the middle of the continent, we are surrounded by more neighbors 
than all other European nations. On the other hand, Germany has 
more inhabitants than any of our neighboring countries. 
However, we are not different from the people of other nations. 
  The nations will continue to exist and be needed in the 
foreseeable future --for the democratic control of the path 
toward Europe on which we have embarked, for example. This path 
leads us to joint institutions of European cooperation that are 
based on a secure legal foundation. 
  This is not in contradiction with the concerns of our 
nation. 
Quite the contrary: It is in our national interest for this 
process to continue. Particularly because we are situated in 
the middle of the continent, it is more logical and easy for us 
Germans to link the well-being of our country with the progress 
of European unification. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is the strong emphasis on the national element 
intended as a cohesive factor, as suggested by some parties? Is 
it possible to hold the diverging society together? 
  [Weizsaecker] There are different aspects. First: There is 
no doubt that the distance between the state and the citizens 
has increased, that a process of privatization is under way. 
Second: As far as the rights of the laender vis-a-vis the 
government are concerned, federalism is a completely undisputed 
and healthy element of our state structure. Third: Only 
appealing to national feelings with the aim of shutting 
ourselves off from the outside and of developing a special 
political role of national isolation because of our central 
geographical position would be dangerous. However, such ideas 
fortunately do not stand a chance of being realized. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How would you define the term nation? 
  [Weizsaecker] It is the joint responsibility for the past 
and the joint will to live, and the will to tackle the problems 
of the present and the future. Spiritual elements form the 
basis of a nation, not skin color or even the language. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. President, views on the joint basis in 
united Germany differ greatly. There was a vehement controversy 
at the Bundestag recently when the commission of inquiry 
presented its report on the dictatorship of the Socialist Unity 
Party of Germany. It was sparked off by a member of the Party 
of Democratic Socialism who reported about the antifascism at 
the beginning of the German Democratic Republic that inspired 
the resistance fighters and emigrants. Was he not right? 
  [Weizsaecker] In any event, such debates are urgently needed 
and very useful. Everyone should tell his biography. Then we 
will learn how to make the necessary differentiations. There 
were certainly die-hard Stalinists whose antifascism must not be 
seen as an excuse for the prolonged suppression of freedom with 
other instruments. On the other hand, there were emigrants who 
returned to divided Germany and made a new beginning with 
sincere convictions on the soil of the old GDR. Just think of 
Hans Mayer or Stefan Heym. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you believe that the demonization of the 
GDR leads to a nostalgia for the former east German state, as 
Pastor Friedrich Schorlemmer stated? 
  [Weizsaecker] Those who have lived all their lives in the 
West are well advised to listen to Friedrich Schorlemmer. They 
can learn a great deal. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The central topic during your 10 years of 
office was the German past. Your views focused on guilt, shame, 
and responsibility. One always noticed your personal 
commitment, which may have been the reason for the positive 
response. You, born in 1920, were a soldier after 1938. You 
knew some of the men who attacked Hitler on 20 July 1944. In 
retrospect, do you wish you had been more courageous? 
  [Weizsaecker] We did not hold very important positions. We 
were constantly exposed to one-sided propaganda. However, often 
we were not ready to risk anything and not courageous enough to 
really open our eyes and follow the signs of injustice. I was 
most impressed by the students of the White Rose in Munich or 
the Quangel workers in Berlin-Wedding who did nothing but name 
the traces of Nazi crimes and give evidence for the truth while 
risking their lives. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Did you feel guilty because you survived? 
  [Weizsaecker] There were such moments. But then one wants 
to continue to live as decently as possible. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. President, at the end of their terms of 
office, politicians usually think about what will be written 
about them in the history books. Willy Brandt used to say: "I 
tried hard." Helmut Schmidt said in an equally dry manner that 
he would like to read the following about himself: "He carried 
out his task in a decent manner." What do you want the 
historians to write about you? 
  [Weizsaecker] If the historians are interested, they should 
do this job. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Thank you very much for the interview.
