No intelligent consumer would buy a car without first taking it for a
test-drive. So what about computer products? Car buyers go to a showroom
when they want to try a new model, but buyers of computer systems can now
evaluate hardware or software without ever leaving their desks.
Digital Equipment Corporation, the US computer maker, is allowing users of
the Internet, the self-regulating global computer network, to test the
company's Alpha computers by using their own software programs on its
hardware. Without having to go near the machines, users, via the Internet,
can tap into one of four Alpha computers located in the US.
By activating a standard Internet file transfer protocol, they can then
transfer their software to a DEC machine and effectively use the hardware
from any range.
So far, more than 7,500 users internationally have logged-on to try out DEC
machines and test its product claims of speed and efficiency.
James Bishop, faculty fellow in the department of physics at the University
of Notre Dame, Indiana, says that when hardware had to be shipped to
customers for testing, time was wasted.
The scheme also reduces DEC's marketing costs. 'We only have to manage a
handful of machines connected to the Internet, rather than running many
systems in the marketplace, or loaning out a large inventory,' says Russ
Jones, DEC's marketing manager. Some users log on to the Alpha system in
order to test their own programs. Software developers, for example, use DEC
machinery to evaluate new codes before attempting to market them, while
software users use Alpha equipment to check for bugs in their own systems.
'We have been encountering problems in running certain software on our
systems,' says Ignacio Lizardo, an engineer at United Technologies
Corporation's chemical systems division in San Jose, California. 'By
transferring our program codes to the DEC systems we can determine if it is
a problem with our system or see if we need to make hardware upgrades.'
DEC believes the Internet allows for more rigorous testing of its products.
'The fact that it is in the public domain on the Internet allows people to
satisfy themselves that it is a robust system when they combine the hardware
with their own software,' says Olivier DeWandre, programme manager for
education and research at DEC Europe.
Software buyers can also test packages before they hand over their cash.
Unipalm, the UK's largest provider of Internet connections, allows network
users to run several programs via the Internet before deciding to purchase.
Users who want an evaluation copy of a software program are given a 'key' -
not unlike an ATM pin number - that allows them to download programs on to
their systems. The programs are 'time-bombed' so that they work only for a
limited period. 'If you like the program you get in touch with us and we
will sell you a permanent key,' says a Unipalm spokesman.
