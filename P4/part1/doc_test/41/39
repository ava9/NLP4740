The surge of interest in the Internet has prompted manufacturers to launch
equipment designed to give novices easier access.
Compaq, which believes it is the first large computer company to launch an
Internet-ready PC, will supply all its Presario computers with Easynet
software, which provides Internet access, from December 1. Prices range from
Pounds 1,399 to Pounds 1,799.
Carrera Technology, a UK company, has already launched a range of
Internet-ready PCs. A modem, Easynet software and a year's subscription to
the Internet adds an additional Pounds 349 to the cost of the computer.
