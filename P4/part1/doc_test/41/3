A massive electronic network linking more than 60,000 computers remains 
vulnerable to potentially crippling attack by computer "viruses," the General 
Accounting Office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said the White House science adviser 
should oversee efforts to help protect the network, Internet, from sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
In a report, the agency said lax security procedures on Internet contributed to 
the severity of problems that resulted when a software virus "infected" the 
system last November, crippling thousands of computers. 
</P>
<P>
Internet, the main computer network used by the U.S. research community, is 
composed of more than 500 national, regional and local networks nationwide and 
overseas handling unclassified information. Two of the largest component 
networks are sponsored by the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency and the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO report was released at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee on telecommunications and finance. 
</P>
<P>
Jack L. Brock Jr., director of the GAO's government information and financial 
management division, told the panel that since the virus attack last fall, 
security has been strengthened on many computers connected to Internet. 
</P>
<P>
However, "we still feel that the lack of central control (over security) . . . 
remains a problem," he testified. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the subcommittee, asked Brock 
whether Internet was still vulnerable to computer viruses and other types of 
software sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO official responded: "Sure. . . . No open system can ever be completely 
secure." 
</P>
<P>
Computer viruses are generally small strings of computer codes that can 
infiltrate software programs and replicate themselves thousands of times, 
causing computer systems to "crash." In some cases, they can surreptitiously 
alter or destroy computer data. 
</P>
<P>
Also testifying at the hearing was John Landry, appearing on behalf of ADAPSO, 
the Computer Software and Services Industry Assn.
