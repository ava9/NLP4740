  [Text] Corporate and individual PC users here will have 
easier access to a vast library of high-quality information 
possessed by renowned foreign research institutes as Korea 
Telecom (KT) launched a commercial Internet service in Seoul 
yesterday. 
  Internet is the world's largest academic computer 
communications network linking 63,000 host computers and LANs in 
60 countries. 
  More than 2 million PCs are connected with each other 
through 
Internet and about 10 million subscribers are currently using 
the service all over the world. 
  The new service, dubbed Kornet, is expected to provide 
Korea's ordinary PC users with up-to-the minute information in 
such fields as economics, culture, science and technology, by 
way of E-mail, remote login, or file transfer, a KT spokesman 
said. 
  The remote login service, for example, will enable Internet 
subscribers in Seoul to freely operate super computers in the 
United States. 
  "High-class information made public by world-class think 
tanks such as NASA, Bell Laboratories, MIT, FDA, and Harvard and 
Stanford Universities will be conveniently available to PCs at 
home and offices here," he said. 
  The Kornet service will most certainly provide a turning 
point in the upgrading of the nation's economic and 
technological bases and form an important part of the proposed 
information super-highway project, he noted. 
  So far, the Internet service has been offered to only a 
small 
number of state-run research centers. 
  Critics, however, say that Kornet's service charges ranging 
from 25,000 won to 5.2 million won per month are "too expensive." 
  They also fear that a flood of "unhealthy" information would 
be indiscriminately imported from abroad. 
  KT plans to expand the Kornet service by the end of this 
year 
to cover Pusan, Taegu and other large cities, the spokesman said. 
  Meanwhile, the state-funded telecom giant yesterday began to 
offer a new DB (data base) service to help parents locate their 
missing children through its PC communications network, Hitel. 
  "Parents whose children are missing can send their 
children's 
picture, age and address to Hitel and simultaneously check the 
network's list of lost children through PCs. 
  A KT official said Hitel has been linked with police 
computer 
networks and a children's foundation responsible for taking care 
of lost children, adding that information on a total of 8,000 
missing children is currently available.
