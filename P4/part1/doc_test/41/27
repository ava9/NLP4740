Major computer companies say they are taking seriously the threat of a computer 
virus attack later this week and are advising employees to take precautions to 
protect their systems. 
</P>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and International Business Machines 
Corp. have both issued internal memos warning staff about the impending virus, 
called Datacrime, which is expected to be activated Thursday or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A computer virus is a destructive program in a computer system that can damage 
or destroy data. It is called a virus because it acts like a biological virus 
-- it can travel from an "infected" disk or program and infect other computers. 
</P>
<P>
Computer industry experts say Datacrime is an especially dangerous virus that 
could infect older IBM personal computers and compatibles based on Intel 
Corp.'s 8086 chip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Puts Organization at Risk 
</P>
<P>
"It's very, very rare but very destructive," said Russell Brand, chief 
technical adviser at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, 
Calif. Brand said his group has examined Datacrime in an infected computer. 
</P>
<P>
Since networked computer systems are so widely used by major corporations, 
universities and the government, a virus could disrupt thousands of machines. A 
virus also puts an organization at risk if its computer is penetrated by 
outsiders or exposed to programs of unknown origin. 
</P>
<P>
Brand said Datacrime is unique because it can wipe out a complete hard disk. 
"Most viruses, you can put the data back together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Without a hard disk drive, there is no way of getting to information on the 
disk, except to re-format that sector -- thus destroying all the files. 
</P>
<P>
At AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, employees were warned not to use software from 
unknown sources and to back up data. 
</P>
<P>
IBM, which introduced an anti-viral software product last week, said it is 
advising its employees to begin using its new software, and make copies of 
their data. 
</P>
<P>
IBM's product scans IBM compatible computer programs, looking for a change in 
programming patterns that may signify a computer virus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Source Is Unknown 
</P>
<P>
Datacrime, also dubbed the Columbus Day virus because of this week's Columbus 
Day holiday, has already infected a number of corporate systems and government 
installations. 
</P>
<P>
Experts do not know the source of Datacrime, except that it was first discussed 
publicly at a conference for computer hackers in Europe this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Brand and other experts said there are other viruses rumored among computer 
hackers -- one estimate is that about 77 viruses are in circulation. 
</P>
<P>
One of the oldest viruses is called Jerusalem and has about 12 strains, or 
variations. Jerusalem, which was discovered by a professor at Hebrew 
University, may also awaken later this week. 
</P>
<P>
Computer viruses became international news last November when Robert Morris, a 
Cornell University graduate student, wrote and unleashed a program that 
eventually got into one of the largest computer networks in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"People are worried about (viruses), especially those that rely on their PCs," 
said Michael Riemer, executive vice president of Foundationware Inc., a 
consulting firm in Cleveland. "But what viruses have done is forced people to 
look at security and system management in place." 
</P>
<P>
Increased concern about viruses has led to more anti-viral software programs on 
the market, some available at no cost through software-sharing programs.
