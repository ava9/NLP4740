Of the four men who have been engaged to conduct the Santa Monica Symphony this 
season -- ergo, the four contenders for the post of music director -- John 
Barnett, who led the orchestra Sunday evening at Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, 
has the longest resume, having conducted in too many cities to list here. 
</P>
<P>
At 72, Barnett is also the oldest. 
</P>
<P>
That may or may not affect his chances to succeed Yehuda Gilad as the 
orchestra's sixth conductor; although Gilad was the youngest of five candidates 
in 1981-82, Victor Bay, Gilad's predecessor, began his 16-year tenure at the 
age of 69. 
</P>
<P>
As his calling card, Barnett chose an all-orchestral program of music by 
Beethoven, Elgar and Strauss. Following a serviceable reading of the "Leonore" 
Overture No. 1, he presided over a generally respectable, utterly conventional 
account of Beethoven's First Symphony. Barnett's Beethoven proved pleasant 
enough, but not especially exciting. He infused too little brio into the score, 
de-emphasizing, for instance, the syncopated accents in the Scherzo, and doing 
little to instill the music with a sense of momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Though the strings found themselves scrambling more than a few times, the winds 
remained in good form, even if the woodwind solos were difficult to hear in the 
barn-like hall. 
</P>
<P>
Balance problems proved even more bothersome in the Suite from Richard Strauss' 
"Der Rosenkavalier," where individual lines, during the tutti sections, 
dissolved into a kind of murky fog of sound. Surely, Civic Auditorium was not 
entirely to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Still, one found much to admire in this "Rosenkavalier" Suite: Barnett 
generated exciting contrasts and paced the 20-minute work intelligently; 
moreover, the solos were executed brilliantly. 
</P>
<P>
Before the suite, Barnett conducted the orchestra's strings in an imperfect but 
elegantly phrased reading of Elgar's Serenade in E minor.TERRY McQUILKIN
