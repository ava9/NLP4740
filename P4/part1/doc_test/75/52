The policy was always that the resident orchestra at the Royal Festival
Hall, whichever it may be, would offer more adventurous programmes than were
usual in the past. Now that the London Philharmonic is installed in the
position, the programmes we are getting are certainly different, although
some logic in the way they are put together would also help.
There was no musical link between the items in Wednesday's concert. Only the
orchestra's own activities provided some connection. In its other residency
at Glyndebourne the London Philharmonic took part in some of the wind
serenades commissioned to mark the Mozart bicentenary last year. Robert
Saxton's Paraphrase on Mozart's Idomeneo was the one most obviously based on
a drama and it came over with fine dramatic punch here, conducted by Jeremy
Jackman.
From wind serenade to a capella chorus. The London Philharmonic Choir also
wanted to play its part and the next piece was Mendelssohn's Psalm 2: 'Warum
toben die Heiden', after the Saxton a very comfortable Victorian setting for
double choir, in which the chorus sounded less confident than it was to do
later.
From these two openers it would be impossible to guess the main work of the
evening: Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The orchestra come on cold for the
symphony, which was an obvious risk. The opening movement gave us a big,
romantic orchestra let loose, with roaring horns and thunderous timpani
obscuring the rest, but then clarifying what is going on in a tidy fashion
has never been among Klaus Tennstedt's primary objectives in Beethoven.
Tennstedt now looks to be one of the last purveyors of the German classics
as they used to be, grand, awesome, inspirational. Or, at least, he is one
of the last who can take the liberties with the music which that style
presupposes and make it work. No matter how extreme a pulling-around of the
tempo is dared, Tennstedt convinces the listener for that moment that the
music is being genuinely felt and communicated.
In the earlier movements spontaneity of feeling was at the expense of
symphonic logic. But the arrival of the imposing bass Rene Pape to announce
the 'Ode to Joy' dispelled any lingering doubts. The finale, well sung by
the London Philharmonic Choir and supported by the other three soloists,
Lucia Popp, Ann Murray and Anthony Rolfe Johnson, found majesty and mystery
in plenty. Tennstedt remains the London Philharmonic's trump card.
