At the Wigmore Hall Marks &amp; Spencer is sponsoring a three-concert series,
'Outstanding Young Artists'. The second concert was given on Thursday by the
20-year-old pianist Leon McCawley, who failed to win the Leeds competition
last September. The jury was widely thought to have made the wrong choice -
especially because McCawley was roughly ten times as creatively illuminating
in Beethoven's First as the eventual winner was (his name escapes me) in the
'Emperor'.
My own vote would have gone, like the BBC-2 viewers' ballot, to the American
Mark Anderson - unmatched for 'mature range and communicative power', I
wrote here at the time. McCawley's virtues were more specialised, though
brightly original and winning in the right repertoire. An 'outstanding young
artist' he certainly is; but his Wigmore recital made one reflect once again
that the best thing for most OYAs would be to emerge for public appearances
just a few times per year, and then return to private, self-critical
development.
The recital's best moments had a true first-water sparkle, above all in four
Scarlatti sonatas. McCawley turned period-ornamental passages with rare
grace and feeling, as he had done at Leeds in Haydn and early Beethoven.
Though he was artfully tender with the rubato breaks, he indulged too many
of them for the good of Scarlatti's brilliant energy - and he varied them
hardly at all in the many repeats.
Instead of more Haydn or early Beethoven, McCawley chose to offer us the
last and most monumental of Beethoven's sonatas, op. 111 in C minor. Only in
the last generation or two have ambitious young pianists taken to displaying
themselves in late Beethoven, like novice conductors undertaking late
Bruckner or Mahler symphonies because those are famous test-pieces.
The trouble is that late Beethoven is neither very showy nor outstandingly
tuneful. McCawley's op. 111 was sincere and thoughtful, not much more. A
fine sense of the near-orchestral muscle in the Allegro, once past a pallid
prologue; then some moments of shining simplicity in the Adagio variations,
not threaded upon any continuous, compelling purpose.
After the interval he played Skryabin's moonstruck op. 57 pieces exquisitely
and bloodlessly (which may be right). The earlier, more robust op. 42 Etudes
had sensitive moments, but in no. 1 the tune disappeared altogether.
In Liszt's Venezia e Napoli suite, McCawley delivered the gloomy central
'Canzone' louder than almost anything else in his programme, and the
showpiece fizz of the final Tarantella never accumulated the head of steam
it deserves. (Balasz Szokolay, a 1990 Leeds competitor, made something
memorably electrifying of it, despite far more fingerslips.) If McCawley
were to concentrate for the moment on the rich range of what he does best,
that would be far better than trying to stake claims to the whole virtuoso
repertoire.
