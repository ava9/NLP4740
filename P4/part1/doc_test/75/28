Of the many things which the world does not need, a new recording of
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony ranks right up there, along with Prozac, pet
rocks and party conferences. I know Herbert von Karajan advised young
conductors to throw away their first 100 versions of the work (pity the poor
audiences) but there comes a point when enough is enough, when the obsessive
pursuit of perfection becomes a futile exercise in megalomania.
I was forced to pause, however, when Franz Welser-Most's new interpretation
of this classic work with the London Philharmonic popped through the post
this week. It was not the gaudy fireworks-by-moonlight scene adorning the
sleeve, nor the performance itself, which is more than competent. It was the
obtrusive white sticker on the front of the compact disc cover: 'Includes
music from Hovis and Pedigree Chum TV ads'.
I know that in the age of the sound-bite and the sample, in a world where
you can walk into a record shop and buy an album called Bach to Basics, this
should not come as a shock; but it did. This is Beethoven's Fifth, for
goodness sake, probably the most famous piece of music in the western world,
and someone is honestly trying to use it to sell brown bread and dog food?
And worse still, someone is trying to sell the compact disc by advertising
that it is used to advertise brown bread and dog food?
My mind reeled as I tried to recall the offending items but my memory, and
my imagination, drew a blank. Hovis: a wholesome family sits at the kitchen
table glowing with health and well-regulated fibre intake - da-da-da-da. It
just didn't pan out. Pedigree Chum: a cuddly spaniel bounds towards its bowl
of nourishing goodies - da-da-da-da. No way. These are the opening bars
which Beethoven reputedly described as 'fate knocking at the door'; could he
really have been referring to a kennel?
My curiosity was getting the better of me; I had to make a few calls. The
man from Hovis was brisk and confident. 'No, we've never used Beethoven's
Fifth, nor any Beethoven for that matter. We use Dvorak, the second movement
of the New World Symphony.'
He was so assertive, it sounded like the most logical pairing in the world.
'And there are no plans to use Beethoven?' 'None.' There was no doubt in
this man's mind, Hovis and Dvorak was a marriage baked in heaven, and any
interlopers were not welcome.
The woman from Pedigree Chum was less strident, and had to check: 'No, there
is no record of us having used Beethoven at all.' She sounded relieved. 'I
mean it just doesn't seem like music for one of our ads. It's a bit heavy,
isn't it?'
I nervously agreed that, yes indeed, it was a bit heavy, but in truth I had
lost all confidence in my ability to match world-famous pieces of music with
pet food products. If she had said that Pedigree Chum had been using
Siegfried's Funeral March for the last 20 years, I would not have batted an
eyelid. But she did not say that; instead she added that the music they were
'famous for' (where have I been all these years?) was Dvorak's New World
Symphony.
The mystery was solved. It was a cock-up, the right sticker on the wrong
compact disc cover. My instincts were proved correct; no-one can use the
music of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony to push products. My ideals remained
intact, the great man could once again bask in the purity of his genius. A
final call, to EMI, and the end to my nightmare: the sticker was an innocent
mistake, and should not be appearing in the shops. Simple as that.
But the issue will not go away. Does listening to snatches of classical (or,
as some would have it, 'serious') music as an inducement to buy essentially
trivial products really do any harm?
The reason we, as a culture, continue to churn out Beethoven Fifths is in
ritualistic affirmation of our sophistication and love of high art. This, we
continually tell ourselves, is what we are capable of; this is the peak of
human achievement. It may have taken place some 200 years ago, but we are
still recording it, still travelling to see it performed, still discussing
it.
Are these sentiments not infected when such works of sublime intent are
wrung through the warped minds of some crazed creative department? Or is it
just a 'harmless bit of fun', that clarion-call of our times? Beethoven, a
most complex man, lived in a much simpler world. I find it difficult to
conceive of how fate knocking at the door would sound in 1994, but I have
the horrible feeling that after the first two notes, there would be a
commercial break.
