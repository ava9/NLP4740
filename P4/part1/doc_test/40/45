biotechnology network

The most ambitious commercial network dedicated to research and development
in genetic medicine so far was announced yesterday by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer,
the Franco-American pharmaceutical group.
RPR has set up collaborations with 14 companies and academic research
organisations in the US and France, to create what it says is 'the world's
first broad biotechnology network' in the related fields of gene therapy and
cell therapy. At the same time it is establishing a new division, RPR
Gencell, to co-ordinate the network.
Gene therapy involves treating disease by transferring new genetic material
(DNA) to the patient's cells. Cell therapy means removing cells from the
body and treating them with biological agents, such as growth factors, to
increase their activity before returning them to the patient. The two
techniques coincide in 'ex vivo gene therapy', when DNA is added to cells
removed temporarily from the body, to restore the function of a missing or
defective gene.
'Cell and gene therapies offer the opportunity to cure disease at its
origin, while improving quality of life, reducing healthcare costs and
developing new preventive practices,' says Robert Cawthorn, RPR chief
executive.
'It is clear that a variety of technologies - a toolbox, if you will - are
needed if we are to conquer diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and
cardiovascular disease. Our answer is RPR Gencell, an integrated network of
external and internal scientists that will share the 'tools' and expertise
necessary to build successful cell and gene therapeutics on an accelerated
timescale.'
According to Thierry Soursac, general manager of RPR Gencell, the company
has invested Dollars 300m (Pounds 190m) over the past two years in setting
up the network. RPR expects to spend about Dollars 100m next year on R&amp;D in
gene and cell therapy.
Other international drug companies, such as Sandoz and Roche of Switzerland,
Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham of the UK, and Eli Lilly of the US, have made
substantial investments in external R&amp;D though alliances with biotech
companies and universities. But Soursac claims that the RPR network is
better planned and more comprehensive in its chosen field.
'The others have less a network and more a succession of investments,' he
says. 'We have built something from the ground up, with clear vision and
therapeutic focus.'
According to Soursac, RPR was able to set up its collaborations relatively
inexpensively, without the huge up-front payments that some other drug
companies have made to biotech partners, because its partners can see the
benefits the network will bring them.
'For example, Ed Rubin (of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Human Genome
Centre, California) is floating on tens of millions of dollars (in grants
from the US government's gene sequencing programmes),' Soursac says. 'He
doesn't need more money. What attracted him is the platform of technology
offered by the club.'
Rubin agrees that his centre is less interested in more funding than in
using the RPR network to speed up the application of newly discovered genes,
particularly those predisposing to cardiovascular (heart) disease. 'We have
good candidate genes,' he says. 'We need better tools to deliver them to the
patient.'
The experimental 'vectors' used to carry new genes into human cells include
various viruses and tiny fat-like
particles called liposomes. But there is also evidence that simply injecting
the genes as 'naked DNA' can work well in some circumstances.
The RPR network had six therapies in clinical trials, with two more trials
about to start. The network will focus initially on cancer, cardiovascular
disease and disorders of the central nervous system.
