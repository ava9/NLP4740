THE LAUNCH of a government booklet on sexual harassment backfired yesterday
as Mr Robert Jackson, employment minister, incurred the wrath of the Equal
Opportunities Commission by claiming that wolf whistles and pin-up calendars
were 'acceptable in certain circumstances'.
The timing of Mr Jackson's comments is unfortunate, given the government's
current efforts to strengthen its appeal to female voters.
New policies on after-school care for children and extra help for families
under stress were launched last weekend. On Tuesday Mr Jackson lectured
business on 'morally wrong' discrimination as he publicised a new government
equal opportunities guide.
At yesterday's launch of the sexual harassment booklet, Mr Jackson said it
was impossible to provide a checklist of actions that would constitute
harassment because that could 'lead down the road of political correctness'.
Wolf whistles and pin-ups might be acceptable in a 'totally all-male
environment where no woman will stray', he said.
Following Mr Jackson's comments, the EOC said: 'We can't think of any
circumstances where it would be acceptable.' A resolution from the European
Community, to which Britain had been a signatory, specifically mentioned
pin-ups and wolf whistles as things that were likely to be offensive to
women, the EOC said.
Ms Clare Short, Labour MP and campaigner against pin-ups, said Mr Jackson's
words 'exposed the government's complete hypocrisy'. The launch of the
booklet had been 'in order to buy women's votes', she said. Pornography in
the workplace gave women the message they should not be there, she added.
Mr Jackson confessed it was not until last summer, when he had sat next to
the chief executive of a large company at a function, that he had taken the
issue of sexual harassment seriously. The chief executive had told him of
his own company's experiences of dealing with a case.
According to Mr Jackson, there was no detailed information on the incidence
of sexual harassment at work although 'anecdotally' it appeared to be quite
a significant problem.
The EOC said there was no need to rely on anecdotal evidence: surveys
already showed the extent of the problem.
Mr Jackson is no stranger to the gaff: his most famous faux pas was in 1990
when he told security staff at Heathrow airport that the case he was
carrying was 'full of bombs'.
