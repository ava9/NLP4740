A bipartisan coalition of more than 130 House members on Tuesday reintroduced 
the equal rights amendment in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment, which became the first joint resolution of the 101st Congress, 
must be approved by two-thirds of both the House and Senate and ratified by 
three-fourths of the states to become part of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The extended deadline for ratification of the last ERA resolution expired June 
30, 1982, three states short of the 38 necessary to support the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Equality of Rights' 
</P>
<P>
The amendment introduced Tuesday, like the previous resolution, states: 
"Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United 
States or by any state on account of sex." 
</P>
<P>
The measure was co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of 137 House members. Its 
primary sponsor is Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), who chairs the House 
Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights. Among co-sponsors 
are Rep. Hamilton Fish Jr. (R-N.Y.), the ranking Republican on the House 
Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), a longtime ERA 
proponent. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution is expected to be introduced in the Senate next month, and 
Edwards said he expects to hold hearings on the measure before his subcommittee 
in February or March. 
</P>
<P>
"Let this year be the one in which we finally bring women into the 
Constitution," Edwards said in a statement. "It is time we extend full equality 
of rights under the law to all of our citizens."
