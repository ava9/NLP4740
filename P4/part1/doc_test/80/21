WHAT WOMEN WANT: EQUAL ACCESS FOR INTERVIEWS, NOT BAD JOKES; 
</P>
<P>
LOCKER ROOMS: PROFESSIONAL PARITY, NOT GENDER, NOT NUDITY, IS THE ISSUE FOR

"The vote wasn't unanimous," Tommy John told me on the day the 1977 World 
Series between the New York Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers began, "but on 
the Dodgers we do what a majority of the players decides to do." 
</P>
<P>
In this case, a majority of Dodgers voted to grant me access to their locker 
room so I could interview them alongside my male sportswriting colleagues. But 
I never went into their locker room during the World Series. Midway through the 
opening game, then-Commissioner Bowie Kuhn overruled the Dodgers. Baseball, 
Kuhn's men said, was not ready to allow women reporters into locker rooms even 
if the sport's more enlightened citizenry, in this case the players, approved. 
</P>
<P>
My yellow press pass for the World Series said in bold letters that I could be 
admitted. Those words were meaningless as long as any woman reporter wore them. 
The fact that professional basketball and hockey leagues had voluntarily opened 
their teams' locker-room doors several years earlier didn't matter to Kuhn. Nor 
did pleas that this case was one of equal rights. Baseball was ready and 
willing to take a constitutional stand against equality for women reporters at 
the locker-room door. 
</P>
<P>
After several months of unproductive discussions with Kuhn and his 
representatives, my employer, Sports Illustrated, determined that it would have 
to go to court. The magazine's own staff was bursting with young, competent 
female reporters who trusted they would have an equal chance to excel in their 
chosen profession. Similarly at newspapers and television stations, women were 
hired to cover sports. 
</P>
<P>
Without equal access to players, women clearly could not match their male 
colleagues in day-to-day coverage. Nor could I, a magazine reporter, contribute 
the background information essential to making our weekly coverage 
comprehensive. Ability wasn't the issue. Without a chance to talk with sources, 
even the most able reporter can't do a good job. For gender to be a primary 
factor in determining success in securing sources was discriminatory and 
illegal. And unnecessary. Players in other sports were proving that. Those who 
wanted to undress wore bathrobes or draped themselves in towels to protect 
their privacy during the short time that reporters -- men and women -- were in 
the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1977, Sports Illustrated filed a lawsuit in federal court; I was a 
named plaintiff. The suit asked for equal access for women to interview 
players. Neither our argument nor the judge's ruling specified that interviews 
must take place in locker rooms. There was only one stipulation: If baseball 
deemed that alternative arrangements were necessary to protect the players' 
privacy, then access had to be the same for men and women reporters. Since 
then, nearly all professional teams have eschewed alternative strategies and 
decided to grant unlimited locker-room access. The system generally has worked 
quite well. 
</P>
<P>
What has never worked as well is the public debate surrounding this issue. 
During the 1970s, stories -- and headlines -- veered toward the supposedly 
titillating aspects of the case. Legal principles and talk of equal rights all 
but vanished beneath a barrage of snide commentaries and giggly remarks about 
ladies intruding on this last male bastion. Often portrayed as women (or called 
in headlines "girls," as in "No Girls Allowed?") who only wanted to gaze at 
naked men, the issue departed starkly from the central question of fairness. 
</P>
<P>
Red Smith, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist, accused me of striking a "note 
of low comedy" by filing this lawsuit, labeling me Sports Illustrated's Joan of 
Arc. Papers carried Smith's syndicated column under the banner "A Laughing 
Matter." Another headline proclaimed: "Woman reporter sues to see Reggie in the 
buff." "She Pitches for Covering Where Everything's Bare" and "Babes in 
Boyland" headlined other stories. 
</P>
<P>
Today, some of the public still doesn't understand. But there is a big 
difference: Equal access for women is no longer viewed as a debatable point. 
Not gender, but professional access, is the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Twelve years ago the legal battle about equal access was resolved by a 
judge. Now there are more than 500 women covering sports (in my day there were 
fewer than 30), and they have formed their own professional association. 
Hundreds of women have done thousands of interviews in locker rooms, as have 
male writers in female locker rooms, such as at the NCAA basketball tournament. 
The public hasn't been hearing about this once-so-inflammatory issue because 
the system usually works well. 
</P>
<P>
Only when a part of the system breaks down does the topic of women in locker 
rooms surface, as recently occurred. One breakdown involved a few New England 
Patriots' players who humiliated and harassed a woman reporter by displaying 
their genitals and mouthing lewd remarks. A few days later Cincinnati Bengals 
coach Sam Wyche denied equal access to players to a woman reporter in defiance 
of league rules. 
</P>
<P>
At first, women's presence -- and not the repugnant behavior of the players or 
the illegal act of the coach -- seemed to be moving to the epicenter of debate. 
As coverage escalated and the same old tired refrains about what women were 
doing in men's locker rooms started to be heard, I feared territory won in the 
1970s might be reclaimed in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
I was wrong. Yes, many people still cannot see past the unaccustomed 
intersection of working women in men's locker rooms and trust that if adults 
act maturely it can work. And yes, some still don't care if women have an equal 
chance to succeed. But it is now quite clear that equal access for women 
writers is secure. No one who holds the power to diminish women's equal access 
has suggested otherwise. In fact, the extraordinary fine of $30,000 levied 
against Wyche and the first-ever appointment of a special counsel to 
investigate the Patriots' debacle are both encouraging signs. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the days when the sound of women asking for equal rights struck notes 
of low comedy. That's something to cheer about as women cover the World Series 
next week, locker rooms and all.
