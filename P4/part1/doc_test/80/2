</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This small Central New York town on the north shore of Cayuga Lake is the 
cradle of the women's rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
That's why the Women's Rights National Historic Park and the National Women's 
Hall of Fame are here. 
</P>
<P>
"Few are aware that the first women's rights convention in the world took place 
in Seneca Falls. It was held July 19 and 20, 1848," said Judy Hart, 47, the 
National Park Service's liaison with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
It was Hart who suggested a National Historic Park be established here to 
preserve and protect the sites associated with the 1848 convention and to 
spread the word about the ensuing struggle for women's rights and equality. 
</P>
<P>
She did the principal work in promoting the idea through Congress, and she was 
the park's first superintendent, getting it off the ground in March, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been tremendously exciting. Within two years all the components of the 
historic park should be in place," said Hart, a 23-year veteran with the Park 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
The women's rights movement began inconspicuously with five women at a tea 
party on July 9, 1848. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the women were Quakers active in temperance and abolition work: 
Lucretia Mott, her sister Martha Wright, Mary Ann McClintock and Jane Hunt. The 
fifth woman was Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the mother of seven children, who later 
became known as the founder and philosopher of the women's rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
Stanton's husband, Henry, was an abolitionist leader. It was at the World 
Anti-Slavery Convention in London in 1840 that Mott and Elizabeth Stanton first 
met. There the two women discussed women's rights and equality and vowed to 
meet again to formulate a plan to do something about the issues. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until eight years later that they saw each other again, this time 
at the tea party where they and the other three women began expressing anger 
and discontent about the role of women's lot in life. They decided to have a 
women's rights convention and agreed to meet a week later to plan the event at 
McClintock's house. 
</P>
<P>
At the McClintock home, the five women sat around a mahogany table and drafted 
a document called the Declaration of Sentiments, which served as a framework 
for their convention. 
</P>
<P>
Stanton, principal architect of the Declaration of Sentiments, was 33 at the 
time, the same age as Thomas Jefferson when he wrote the Declaration of 
Independence. It was her idea to model the Declaration of Sentiments after the 
Declaration of Independence. 
</P>
<P>
"We hold the truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created 
equal," read the Declaration of Sentiments with the words and women added. 
</P>
<P>
"Because women do feel themselves aggrieved, oppressed and fraudulently 
deprived of their most sacred rights, we insist they have immediate admission 
to all the rights and privileges which belong to them as citizens of the United 
States," the declaration continued. 
</P>
<P>
The Seneca County Courier carried an announcement that a women's rights 
convention would be held at the Weslayan Methodist Church on July 19 and 20, 
only nine days after the five women first sat down around a table drinking tea 
and airing their grievances. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 men and women showed up at the church. Stanton, a housewife who 
had never given a speech in her life, courageously stood up and read the 
Declaration of Sentiments. Genteel women at that time did not speak in public. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Stanton had been filled with increasing terror," wrote Miriam Gurko in 
"The Ladies of Seneca Falls," her book about the birth of the women's rights 
movement. "It was a combination of stage fright at the prospect of making her 
first public speech, and consternation at having initiated this unprecedented 
action by women. 
</P>
<P>
"A housewife in any period might have quailed at such a formidable undertaking; 
for a woman in 1848 it was outrageously rash and untraditional, which made it 
practically earth-shaking." 
</P>
<P>
At the convention, they passed resolutions proposing women's right to vote, 
their right to equal pay, their right to control their own money and their 
right to receive equal treatment under the law. The declaration and resolutions 
were signed by 68 women and 32 men. The suffrage movement was under way. 
</P>
<P>
When the park service's Hart came to Seneca Falls, population 7,000, to launch 
the Women's Rights National Historic Park, her first office was in a vacant 
room at the local radio station. 
</P>
<P>
"Funding that first year was $5,000. The park consisted of me, my second-hand 
typewriter and a couple of temporary exhibits," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the Elizabeth Cady Stanton Foundation donated Mrs. Stanton's home, but 
still the park was small and incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
Now the National Park Service is opening a permanent visitors' center, building 
a new exhibit arena called Declaration Park, and buying the McClintock home 
where the declaration was written. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the Declaration Park is Weslayan Methodist Church, which was 
purchased three years ago. The church, built in the 1830s, has gone through 
many changes over the years. Its last use was a self-service laundry and an 
apartment house. 
</P>
<P>
"We will keep only those parts of the church that were there when the 
convention was held, that is the roof and two walls. Everything else will be 
removed," said Linda Canzanelli, 33, Hart's successor as superintendent of the 
historic park. 
</P>
<P>
A contest with a $15,000 prize was held to design Declaration Park. Ann 
Marshall and Ray Kinoshita, students at the Harvard School of Design, submitted 
the winning entry. 
</P>
<P>
The two walls and roof of the old church will become an open-air building with 
exhibit panels. A huge reproduction of the Declaration of Sentiments will stand 
next to a "water wall." 
</P>
<P>
To complete the renovations on Women's Rights National Historic Park, the park 
service is going to convert the turn-of-the-century village hall into a 
permanent visitors center. A temporary visitors center filled with exhibits 
pertaining to the history of the women's rights struggle is half a block away. 
</P>
<P>
The Stanton home is also open for visitation, and the McClintock home soon will 
be. It is hoped the historic park will be finished with all the components open 
to the public within two years. 
</P>
<P>
A block from the Women's Rights National Historic Park is the National Women's 
Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, nearly two dozen Seneca Falls women met over tea, just like 
the five original feminists, to formulate plans for the Hall of Fame. In 1973 
they inducted the first group of 20 women who made outstanding contributions to 
this nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
Last year a national committee chose Sally Ride, the first American woman to 
fly in space, and Gwendolyn Brooks, the Pulitzer Prize-winning black poet. A 
total of 42 women have been honored, including Marian Anderson, Susan B. 
Anthony, Mary Cassatt, Willa Cather, Emily Dickinson, Amelia Earhart, Helen 
Hayes, Mary Harris "Mother" Jones, Helen Keller, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Harriet 
Tubman, and "Babe" Didrikson Zaharias. 
</P>
<P>
An illustrated biography of each inductee is featured on a large panel in the 
Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"Until now only a few thousand a year have visited the Women's Rights National 
Historic Park and the National Women's Hall of Fame, but we expect the numbers 
to jump to at least 200,000 annually once the historic park is completed," said 
Hart. 
</P>
<P>
It is anticipated that considerable media attention will then be focused on the 
Hall of Fame and historic park, and many more Americans will learn about the 
feminists of Seneca Falls, their Declaration of Sentiments and the history of 
the women's rights movement the past 141 years.
