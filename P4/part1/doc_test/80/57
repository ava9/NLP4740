FT  08 JAN 94 / Equal pay victory for 1,500 women

The largest group of women to win an equal pay case in Britain were
yesterday celebrating pay rises of between 37 per cent and 74 per cent.
1,500 women welfare assistants in West Sussex schools were awarded pay
parity with council van drivers by a Southampton industrial tribunal in a
case concerning equal pay for work of equal value submitted four years ago.
Mr Phil Wood, the local representative of Unison, the public service union,
said the basic increase on the annual pay bill of West Sussex county council
would be Pounds 1.2m but that could rise to Pounds 2.3m as women moved up
seniority scales.
Most women will see their hourly rate increase from Pounds 2.94 to Pounds
4.04 but that could rise to Pounds 5.13 with seniority. Mr Wood said: 'The
settlement will give confidence and encouragement to women in all walks of
life to fight for a better pay deal. It is also a clear signal to all
employers that Unison and other unions are working hard to ensure that women
are treated equally.' The case, brought on behalf of four welfare
assistants, has cost the union Pounds 100,000.
Equal pay cases have been dogged by length and cost. Only about 25 cases
have been completed successfully in the past 10 years. The Equal
Opportunities Commission recently opened discussions with the government
about making legislation work better. It has also threatened to take the
government to the European Court of Justice if it does not amend the laws to
make them easier to apply.
