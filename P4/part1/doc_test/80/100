FT  13 JUL 92 / Council appeals on dinner ladies' pay

THE fate of 1,300 dinner ladies' pay could affect the ability of local
authorities to compete with the private sector to provide services.
North Yorkshire County Council is to appeal to the Employment Appeal
Tribunal against an industrial tribunal ruling that it treated the women
unfairly by cutting their pay and working conditions to win a competitive
tender for school meals.
EAT has high-court status so its decision will set a precedent although the
losing side may go to the Court of Appeal.
The industrial tribunal ruled last month that the council was wrong to cut
the women's pay by 30p an hour because predominantly male groups of council
workers had won contracts without cuts.
Councils provide a range of services employing men and women at nationally
negotiated pay rates. This makes it easier for women in the public sector to
show they are earning less than male colleagues.
The council argues that if EAT upholds the dinner ladies' claim then
private-sector employers will underbid councils by paying women less. Women
in the private-sector companies would have no recourse as they could not
compare their pay to that of men employed by the council.
The public-sector union, Nupe, which is backing the women, believes a
private-sector employer could not pay women less because this would be
illegal victimisation of people pursuing their right to equal pay.
The council says it will have to pay the women more than Pounds 1m,
including back pay if EAT upholds the women's claim.
