(i) A single goal for minorities and a separate single goal for women have been established. The Contractor, however,
is required to provide equal employment opportunity and to take affirmative action for all minority groups, both
male and female, and all women, both minority and non-minority. Consequently, the Contractor may be in violation
of Executive Order 11246 if a particular group is employed in a substantially disparate manner (for example, even
though the Contractor has achieved its goals for women generally, the Contractor may be in violation of Executive
Order 11246 if a specific minority group of women is underutilized).

(j) The Contractor shall not use the goals and timetables or affirmative action standards to discriminate against
any person because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.

(k) The Contractor shall not enter into any Subcontract with any person or firm debarred from Government contracts

(l) The Contractor shall carry out such sanctions and penalties for violation of these specifications and of the Equal
Opportunity Clause, including suspension, termination and cancellation of existing subcontracts as may be imposed
or ordered pursuant to Executive Order 11246, as amended, and its implementing regulations, by the Office of Federal
Contract Compliance Programs. Any Contractor who fails to carry out such sanctions and penalties shall be in violation
of these specifications and Executive Order 11246, as amended.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) The Contractor, in fulfilling its obligations under these specifications, shall implement specific affirmative
action steps, at least as extensive as those standards prescribed in paragraph (g) of these specifications, so as
to achieve maximum results from its efforts to ensure equal employment opportunity. If the Contractor fails to comply
with the requirements of Executive Order 11246, the implementing regulations, or these specifications, the Director
shall proceed in accordance with 41 CFR 60&hyph;4.8.

(n) The Contractor shall designate a responsible official to monitor all employment related activity to ensure that
the company EEO policy is being carried out, to submit reports relating to the provisions hereof as may be required
by the Government and to keep records. Records shall at least include for each employee the name, address, telephone
numbers, construction trade, union affiliation if any, employee identification number when assigned, social security
number, race, sex, status (e.g., mechanic, apprentice, trainee, helper, or laborer), dates of changes in status,
hours worked per week in the indicated trade, rate of pay, and locations at which the work was performed. Records shall
be maintained in an easily understandable and retrievable form; however, to the degree that existing records satisfy
this requirement, contractors shall not be required to maintain separate records.
