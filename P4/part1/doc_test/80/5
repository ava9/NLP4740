MALE delegates to the TUC Women's Conference were yesterday crying into
their bitter after being excluded for the first time in the gathering's
62-year history.
Mr Ernie Dudley, a sad-looking delegate from the UCW communications union,
denied that he was hurt, but admitted that he was disappointed. 'It just
seems a bit that people think men are the enemy - and I am not. I have been
coming here for four years. I might still be a bit of a chauvinist, but I am
less of a chauvinist than I was.'
The Women's TUC is a far more flexible and friendly affair than the
male-dominated annual congress of the whole union movement, but this year
the spirit of radicalism past seems to have crept beyond the T-shirt stalls
at Blackpool's Winter Gardens.
The delegates, who recognise that the conference has been marginalised by
the start of the election campaign, voted 142 to 120 to exclude male
delegates - there are 13 this year - to make room for more of the sisters.
They may still attend as voiceless, voteless visitors.
The motion was proposed by Ms Yasmin Ishaq, from Napo, the probation
officers' union, who was delighted with her unexpected success. 'While we
believe we should work together with men to implement policies to the
betterment of women's lives, it should be women who decide what needs to be
changed and improved,' she said.
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, presiding over the debate on Europe
with paternal understanding, explained that the oversubscribed conference
was not losing sons, but gaining daughters.
As the debate turned to training, and delegates began to think of lunch, Mr
Mike Pendred, of the Norwich Trades Council, was obviously upset. 'This is
my third time down here,' he said. 'I use my own time to come down to find
out all about the world of women. I come down because I care. They should
not exclude men from contributing. They need men to come down to go back and
tell other men.'
