between 1830 and 1980 - Belgium was perhaps the most over-centralised state
in Europe. It was not considered a great success, at least during the latter
part of this period. Now, Belgium is well on the way to becoming the most
decentralised, although it is not there yet.
The transition is proving difficult and it is far from certain that the
process will be completed within the next couple of years, as the present
government intends.
The centralised system worked well enough in the 19th century, but only on
the basis of a less-than-democratic constitution and the understanding that
power would be monopolised by the French-speaking minority.
The coming of universal suffrage for men in 1918 - women got the vote only
30 years later - meant that it was only a matter of time before the
Dutch-speakers, who now make up 57 per cent of the population, would gain
the upper hand.
Thereafter, a large part of Belgian politics, and an even greater share of
the emotional commitment, was devoted to pursuing the interests of the two
language groups, with an astonishing array of checks and balances being
built into the Belgian constitution.
It was to little avail. The Dutch-speaking majority was too conscious of
past slights to accept with good grace that, with growing prosperity in
Flanders, they were now the top dogs both economically and politically - the
last 11 governments have all been headed by Dutch-speakers - and could
afford to be magnanimous. The French-speakers were only too aware of their
minority status, and tended to be over-defensive.
Mr Wilfried Martens, who ceased to be prime minster after 12 years last
March, was the first senior Belgian politician to conclude that if the two
language groups could not happily collaborate to run a centralised state,
each of them should be left to run their own affairs, leaving only a minimal
competence to the national government.
He was the principal author of the Egmont Pact of 1977, which foresaw the
creation of three self-governing regions of Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels.
Unfortunately, the pact was never implemented and it was left to Mr Martens
to introduce a more limited scheme of devolution when he became prime
minister in 1979.
This scheme, which came into effect in 1980, established only two regions -
Flanders and Wallonia, leaving Brussels under central control. It also
established three language communities, including one for the tiny
German-speaking minority in eastern Belgium.
The regions were given a long list of economic and social responsibilities,
including planning, the environment, housing, water policy, the economy,
energy, employment and supervision of local government.
The language communities were endowed with a narrower range of
responsibilities, comprising cultural affairs - language matters, museums,
libraries, radio and television, youth policy, sport, tourism, adult
education and scientific research - and personal health and welfare
services.
Each region and community was granted limited taxation powers and an
indirectly-elected assembly. The Dutch-speaking community and the Flemish
region voted immediately to combine, so that one Flemish assembly and one
executive council was responsible for the powers granted to both
authorities.
No such amalgamation occurred on the French-speaking side, so that both
Wallonia and the French-speaking community retained their separate
identities.
This experiment in partial devolution led to a marked lessening in tension
between the two main language groups but failed to remove all the sources of
conflict between them.
The 1987 poll was brought about by a quarrel over the mayoralty of a tiny
mixed-language commune on the Dutch border near Maastricht, known as the
Fourons (Voeren in Dutch). This was the third time in 20 years that this
commune, whose population is less than 4,500, had brought down a Belgian
government and the conviction grew that it was time to reach a final
settlement of all constitutional issues affected by the language issue.
A three-stage programme of reform was drawn up by Mr Jean-luc Dehaene in
1988, as the basis for forming a new government and it was accepted by the
leaders of all the five parties which joined the new left-centre coalition
led by Mr Martens.
The first two stages were enacted with surprising ease, securing the
necessary two-thirds parliamentary majority. These respectively dealt with
power-sharing in mixed-language communes, and with increasing the powers of
the regional and community councils,including the establishment of a third
region for Brussels, with its own directly-elected assembly. Education,
previously under national control, was transfered to the language
communities.
The third stage envisaged the replacement of the Senate with a new upper
chamber representing the regions, and the direct election of the Flemish
assembly and of those for Wallonia and the French-speaking community.
Although the overwhelming majority of parliamentarians supported these
changes in principle, it proved impossible to get agreement on the details.
This is still the position under the new Dehaene government, which lacks a
two-thirds majority although it will need this level of support to get the
changes through.
The biggest difficulty is over whether French speakers living in Flanders
(of whom there are a large number) should have the right to vote in
elections for the French-speaking community. Absolutely, say the Walloons.
Absolutely not, say the Flemings.
Mr Dehaene has set up a standing conference consisting of himself and four
members from each of 10 parties represented in the national parliament to
seek an agreed approach. It is getting nowhere fast - the opposition parties
(in particular, the right-wing Liberals) are setting unacceptable conditions
for support.
The betting in Brussels is that Mr Dehaene will be unable to break the
deadlock and that his government will fall before the autumn. Whether or not
a new government, perhaps expanded to include the Liberals to ensure a
two-thirds majority, will be any more successful, is far from clear.
What is certain is that there is no going back. Either Belgium will complete
its transition to a fully federal state or it will be stuck indefinitely at
its present, rather more than halfway, house. The days of a unified national
structure are dead and gone.
