Former President Richard M. Nixon, actress Elizabeth Taylor, Chrysler Corp. 
Chairman Lee A. Iacocca and hundreds of other mourners filled St. Bartholomew's 
Episcopal Church here Thursday for a memorial service for publisher Malcolm 
Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes, who died Saturday at age 70, loved a good time, from partying to racing 
motorcycles to riding in hot-air balloons, and his memorial service at the Park 
Avenue church had a festive rather than funereal air. 
</P>
<P>
The service featured music on a variety of instruments loved by the Forbes 
magazine owner, including Scottish bagpipes and English horns. 
</P>
<P>
Parked outside the church was Forbes' red, tan and black Harley-Davidson, an 
America flag on one handlebar and the flag of Scotland on the other. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon sat in the front pew of the landmark church, near his daughter Julie 
Eisenhower, Miss Taylor and former Mayor Edward I. Koch. 
</P>
<P>
Other mourners included Barbara Walters, Joan Rivers and David Rockefeller. 
</P>
<P>
In a eulogy, Forbes' son Robert broke down as he said, "I have dreaded this 
moment. It has been a hell of a party. Thanks for the trip." 
</P>
<P>
Forbes' most famous party was a $2-million birthday affair his children threw 
for him last year in Morocco.
