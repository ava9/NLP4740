Hugh Hewitt, executive director of the Richard M. Nixon Library and Birthplace, 
will step down as head of California's first presidential library to resume 
practicing law full time, a library spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt, who oversaw the library's opening ceremonies that drew four presidents 
and dozens of local and national dignitaries to Yorba Linda on July 19, will be 
replaced by John H. Taylor, Nixon's chief of staff for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who will take over as executive director of the library Sept. 17, "is 
the natural choice for the library," said library spokesman Kevin Cartwright. 
"He's worked with President Nixon for 10 years, and he knows the President's 
record. He's very anxious to come out here. It's a great opportunity for both 
John and the library." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 35, a graduate of Andover College and UC San Diego, joined Nixon's 
staff in 1980, Cartwright said. He is the author of "Patterns of Abuse: A Novel 
of Politics and Power," published in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who Cartwright said will move to Yorba Linda with his wife, Marsha, and 
two children from New Jersey, where Nixon maintains an office in Saddle River, 
was not available for comment Friday. Hewitt also was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
Although his association with the library was brief, Hewitt stirred national 
controversy when he told The Times a week before the library's opening that 
researchers would be screened, and those seen as anti-Nixon would be denied 
access to the former President's papers and records. 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt singled out Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward, who won a Pulitzer 
Prize with colleague Carl Bernstein for coverage of the Watergate scandal, as 
one potential researcher who would be denied access to the facility. "He's not 
a responsible journalist," Hewitt said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The screening policy was rescinded after protests from scholars and journalists 
across the country. Hewitt said he revoked the plan because he had imposed it 
without first consulting Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
Library officials on Friday said that Hewitt's resignation as executive 
director was planned several months ago and was not connected to the screening 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"For many, many months he's been concentrating on the successful opening of the 
library," Cartwright said. "He wants to devote his full time to his law 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt will return to the law firm of Pettis, Tester, Kruse &amp; Krinsky in 
Irvine, Cartwright said.
