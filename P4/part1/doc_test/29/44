  [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Chu Tunan, honorary 
chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic 
League, died in Beijing at the age of 95 at 8:25 (Beijing time) 
yesterday, after a long illness. 
  He had been a vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the 
Sixth National People's Congress ten years ago. He was born in 
1899 in Wenshan County, Yunnan Province, south-west China. He 
had been a professor of Jinan University, Shanghai Teachers 
University and Yunnan University. He joined China Democratic 
League in 1943. He was former chairman of the Chinese People's 
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. He was also 
a translator of "Leaves of Grass" by Walt Whitman of U.S. 
  He left a testament requesting that his funeral arrangements 
should be simple. There should be no memorial meeting, no 
ceremony of paying last respects to his remains, and no wreaths 
to be presented. His body should go to a hospital for research, 
and none of his ashes should be kept.
