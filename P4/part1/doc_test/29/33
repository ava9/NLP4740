The Corruption and Fall of Richard Nixon
By Fred Emery
Jonathan Cape, Pounds 20, 542 pages
It is instructive to look again at the edition of Life magazine, dated
November 25 1968. On the cover, next to the caption 'The Nixon era begins',
is a smiling president-elect, but the text and pictures inside now come over
with a sense of retrospective fore-boding.
There is a three-quarter-page shot of election night in New York conspicuous
for its lack of warmth and enthusiasm. Richard Milhous Nixon and his family
are celebrating, but the crowd is curiously static, no punched fists in the
air, no one obviously shouting approval. Reflecting on an awful year, with
two assassinations, race riots and violent anti-war demonstrations at the
Democratic convention in Chicago, Life did not hold out much hope that the
new president could change things for the better. His campaign had been
'serviceable if not inspiring', his solutions 'managerial and unspecific'.
When he died last month, American reactions to their 37th president went
through two phases in quick order. The first, dictated by the decent
instinct not to speak ill of the dead and spurred on by the generous
eulogies of President Bill Clinton and others, almost amounted to a kind of
revisionism. Obituaries and columns delved deeply enough into the reasons
for his downfall - Watergate - but they were offset by compliments for an
endurance in disgrace that to many was tantamount to rehabilitation, and for
the good things he had done as president. A fixture in American politics
since 1946, there seemed almost a sense of national loss that he was no
longer around as the focus of a new admiration or the old loathing.
The second phase revised this revisionism. Garry Trudeau's 'Doonesbury'
cartoon strip savagely lampooned those who had tried to rewrite Watergate.
Others wrote with passion about the betrayal of a nation's trust by a man
who became the first president to resign in order to avoid impeachment.
Interestingly, for one who had covered Nixon's first term, which ended with
his landslide victory in 1972 but before Judge John Sirica opened cracks in
the Watergate defences, and who had spent long nights in London editing
Watergate copy from our Washington bureau, I found much of both phases
unreadable. I had my opinions of Nixon, I said to myself. Why read those of
others with axes to grind?
Fred Emery has provided a necessary 'reality check' and it could not have
come from a better non-American source. He was The Times's Washington bureau
chief from 1970-77. Unlike the late, great Peter Jenkins who, when resident
Guardian correspondent, knew in his bones that Nixon was rotten, Emery was a
reporter's reporter, in the best American sense of the term, writing what he
knew and could find out without embroidery.
He survived - and thrived - even though his then editor, William Rees-Mogg,
once flew to Washington to tell US journalists assembled at the National
Press Club to stop crucifying their president because Watergate simply was
not important enough. It may be doubted that today's press barons would be
so charitable to those not toeing the proprietor's line.
Emery's book, published in conjunction with the BBC documentary series
already begun in the UK and due to air in the US to coincide with the 20th
anniversary of Nixon's resignation in August, is a smoothly written,
meticulously researched narrative account of what began as 'a third-rate
burglary' and ended as a cover-up of monumental proportions at the highest
levels of government.
Of course, as he makes 'perfectly clear', to use Nixon's favourite phrase,
it did not all begin with the break-in of Democratic party offices on the
Memorial Day weekend of 1972. The seeds had been sown a good two years
earlier, as an enraged Nixon - and an equally furious Henry Kissinger -
tried to find out who had been leaking what over the bombing incursions in
Cambodia and the publication of the Pentagon Papers, detailing US
involvement in Vietnam.
The cast of characters that was to become notorious - Haldemann, Ehrlichman,
Mitchell, Liddy, Hunt, Dean, Huston, Young, Magruder and many more - was
commissioned (the 'plumbers') and in place for 'dirty tricks'. What they did
still has the power to shock, but nothing like as much as the cover-up
itself. The endemic characteristic of good US scandals is that the act
itself is never as bad as subsequent attempts to frustrate and conceal, a
lesson still not learnt 20 years on.
Indeed, if there is one overriding lesson from this book relevant to
contemporary revisionism, it is that Nixon was not betrayed by overzealous
minions taking the vague wishes of his darker side to extremes. The
president might have overruled, in July 1971, a madcap scheme to firebomb
the Brookings Institution, a Democratic redoubt, but for such a plan to have
been drawn up and presented to the Oval Office on the reasonable expectation
of approval speaks volumes for the degree of control exercised from the very
top. If that were true pre-Watergate, it just got worse as events spun out
of the control of even the mastermind.
None of this was evident to, or even suspected by, Life in 1968 beyond its
graphic pictures and words. But Hugh Sidey wrote in that edition that the
new president-elect could do far worse than visit Williamsburg, Virginia,
where independence from Britain was planned, to soak up an atmosphere he
said was still redolent of Washington, Jefferson, Monroe and Madison. We may
only speculate whether history would have been different had Richard Nixon
taken the advice.
