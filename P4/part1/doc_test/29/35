A 5-year-old boy died shortly after he was found hanging Thursday in the garage 
behind his South Los Angeles home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Gabriel McGee was discovered about 1:35 p.m. by his mother, who had 
gone out to the rear of the family's home in the 5300 block of South 8th 
Street, Los Angeles Police Lt. Fred Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-tall stepladder lay on the floor beneath the child, Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
McGee was rushed to Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, where he was 
pronounced dead, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they are unsure whether the death was a suicide or a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
"All we know is that he climbed the ladder and either stepped off or had the 
ladder pushed," said Lt. Richard Iddings of the LAPD's Child Abuse Unit. 
</P>
<P>
As the boy's family and playmates gathered in the driveway of the home, 
saddened adult neighbors standing on street corners and lawns characterized 
Gabriel as sociable. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a sweet child," said a neighbor who identified herself only as Barbara. 
"He always liked to play with the kids around here and play in the yard." 
</P>
<P>
Dabbing tears from her eyes, she joined a chorus of other neighbors who 
rejected speculation that Gabriel may have killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
"That child ain't climbed no 6-foot ladder," said a girl who claimed to be the 
boy's cousin. "There's just no way he is going to do something like that." 
</P>
<P>
Iddings said the boy's parents were being questioned Thursday by the police, 
but investigators had no suspects.
