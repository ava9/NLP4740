Honors: Tennis star Billie Jean King and Texas politician Barbara Jordan will 
be inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame Aug. 26. They were chosen 
from about 1,000 nominees, Sally Parr, the hall's executive director, said 
Wednesday in Washington, D.C. The other inductees are the late photojournalist 
Margaret Bourke-White and Florence Siebert, a medical researcher who isolated 
and purified protein.

Next Question: Richard Nixon still has the press to kick around. His new book, 
"In the Arena," contains some examples of typical reporters' comments, and what 
the former President thinks they really mean: Reporter: "You should hear what 
this other guy said about you." Nixon: "This is . . . entrapment . . . . Don't 
be surprised if your angry jibe appears in print and his doesn't." Reporter: 
"I'm going to write the story, whether you talk to me or not." Nixon: "The 
reporter might be worried he doesn't have a story at all unless you talk to 
him."

Hospitalized: Joy Baker, wife of former Senate Republican Leader Howard H. 
Baker Jr., has had a small malignant growth removed from her right lung. The 
tumor was removed Wednesday at a hospital in Rochester, Minn. A source familiar 
with her case, who did not wish to be identified, said the growth was "a 
low-grade tumor," not a recurrence of the cancer removed from the same lung in 
1982.
