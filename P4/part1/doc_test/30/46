DEFENSE INDUSTRY: WITH THE AEROSPACE SUBSIDIARY UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP, THE FUTURE 
OF ITS AERONUTRONIC DIVISION IN ORANGE COUNTY IS UP IN THE AIR.

Ford Motor Co.'s announcement Monday that it has agreed to sell its Ford 
Aerospace subsidiary to Loral Corp. did little to clarify the future for the 
2,700 employees at the firm's Aeronutronic defense plant here, in part because 
the lease on the plant's property is not included in the sale. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some analysts said Loral, a New York-based defense electronics 
company, is likely to sell off portions of Ford Aerospace that do not 
complement its own operations. For example, the Newport Beach division 
manufactures the venerable Sidewinder and Chaparral missiles, but missiles do 
not fit with Loral's existing operations, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Some Ford Aerospace employees leaving the Newport Beach plant Monday afternoon 
said they had not received enough information to know how the sale will affect 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know enough to say much," said Norman Potter, a materials scientist 
who held a blue paper handout announcing the sale to employees. "Nobody knows 
much about (Loral)." 
</P>
<P>
Ford's Aeronutronic division occupies 99 prime, ocean-view acres that the 
company leases from the Irvine Co. under a contract that expires in 2052. 
Sources said Monday that the lease was not included in the sale and that the 
buyer of Ford Aerospace would be required to vacate the property within five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
A Loral spokeswoman said there were no current plans to sell pieces of Ford 
Aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
But Loral will assume a large debt burden with its acquisition, and some Wall 
Street analysts expect the company to sell some operations, possibly including 
the Virginia-based consultant BDM International Inc., a satellite manufacturing 
operation in Silicon Valley and themissile group in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Beltramo, a Los Angeles defense consultant, speculated that Hughes 
Aircraft Co., which submitted a losing bid for Ford Aerospace in conjunction 
with Alcatel of France, may be interested in buying the missile business. A 
Hughes spokesman declined to comment on that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Ford purchased the Aeronutronic business in 1956 and moved the operation to 
Newport Beach in 1960. The division grew rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s on the 
strength of the Sidewinder air-to-air missile and Chaparral surface-to-air 
missile programs. In the 1970s, the Pave Tack bomb-targeting system also became 
a significant source of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The division was highly profitable in the 1970s and early 1980s, former 
executives have said, and employment at one point reached 3,500. But these 
officials say Ford failed to invest adequately in the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Aeronutronic suffered a major blow in 1985 when the Pentagon canceled the 
problem-plagued Sgt. York tank-mounted gun program after an investment of $1.8 
billion. That resulted in 1,300 layoffs at the Newport Beach plant. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, the Aeronutronic unit has struggled with production problems and 
a decline in orders for its mainstay missile products. Sources have said the 
division is not currently profitable. Still, the firm did receive a lift 
earlier this year when it received orders for a potentially lucrative 
missile-guidance system, and the company's electro-optics technology is highly 
regarded in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of the Aeronutronic unit to another company would not guarantee the 
operation's move from Newport Beach, but a large defense firm might choose to 
relocate production to its own facilities elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
And that possibility worries Richard Luehrs, president of the Newport Harbor 
Area Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about the economic impact," Luehrs said. "We don't know what 
the intent of the buyer might be. It doesn't matter who owns it; the question 
is whether or not it remains an employment center."
