There is no more clearcut illustration of the importance of North America as
a business location for European and Asian corporations than a string of
recent investments in the motor industry.
Toyota, the largest Japanese vehicle manufacturer, announced recently that
it would be raising its vehicle production in the region by nearly 50 per
cent over the next two years, taking its total output from 533,000 units to
790,000 a year.
The increase will come from its existing manufacturing plant in Kentucky,
where it has already put in place the necessary extra production capacity;
from New United Motor Manufacturing, its California-based joint venture with
General Motors; and from Toyota Motor Manufacturing in Canada.
In July, Honda, Japan's third largest carmaker (and the first to establish a
manufacturing presence in the US, in the early 1980s), announced that it
planned an 18 per cent increase in North American vehicle capacity over the
next three years and a 50 per cent boost in engine-making capacity by 1998.
Again, the expansion will take place at its existing factories in Ohio and
Ontario, Canada.
The Japanese companies want to increase their US output partly because the
rise in the value of the yen, relative to the dollar, has made it uneconomic
to import many vehicles from Asia, and partly because Tokyo is under strong
US pressure to reduce its trade imbalance with America.
But they are hardly alone in their expansion plans: over the past two years
two German luxury car manufacturers - BMW and Mercedes-Benz - have both
announced plans to locate in the US, their first manufacturing plants
outside Germany. BMW has built a factory in South Carolina, which produced
its first vehicles last month, while a Mercedes plant is going up in
Alabama.
Both have been lured by America's relatively low labour costs (partly a
function of dollar weakness), by the skills of its workforce, and by the
competitive edge they hope they will gain from being direct participants in
the world's most cut-throat vehicle market, and one of the most innovative.
Like the Japanese, their new US production will be aimed both at domestic
consumers and at the export market.
The increasing motor industry investment is being replicated in many other
sectors, and for broadly similar reasons: no company seeking a global
presence can ignore either the size or fiercely entrepreneurial character of
the US market.
For the US remains by far the world's largest market speaking a single
language, while this year's implementation of the North American Free Trade
Agreement has created a trading area, also embracing Canada and Mexico, of
more than 360m consumers. Nafta is starting to have a significant impact on
location decisions.
Chrysler is building a new Dollars 300m vehicle assembly plant in Mexico,
and analysts expect employment in the nation's motor industry to rise from
160,000 today to 210,000 by 1998.
Foreign direct investment in the US grew remarkably in the 1980s. This was
partly through the start-up of greenfield plants, notably from Japanese car
manufacturers, but much more so through the takeover of existing US
companies. Direct foreign investment grew from Dollars 83bn in 1980 to
Dollars 403.7bn in 1990.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s the growth rate dropped sharply, due to
recession and to alternative investment opportunities opened up by the
economic integration of western Europe, the collapse of the Soviet empire,
an economic boom in several Pacific Rim nations and an improved economic
climate in Latin America.
Foreign spending on acquiring or establishing US businesses totalled Dollars
15.3bn in 1992, down roughly 45 per cent on the previous year and the fourth
consecutive year of decline. It was the lowest total since the Dollars
8.09bn in 1983.
However, over the past 18 months there has been a distinct revival in US
inward investment. Expenditure in 1993 bounced back to Dollars 26.2bn, while
total foreign direct investment, at historic cost, reached Dollars 445.3bn.
This year has seen a flurry of European takeovers or sizeable investments in
US companies, including a Dollars 5.3bn cash bid by Roche of Switzerland for
drugs company Syntex and a Dollars 2.3bn offer by SmithKline Beecham for
drug wholesaler Diversified Pharmaceutical Services.
But where in North America should a foreign company locate its operations?
For those acquiring or expanding a US presence through a takeover, there is
little choice: you set up shop where the acquired company has its
facilities.
But those companies establishing a greenfield presence, or thinking of
changing their existing North American locations, face a complicated
trade-off involving, among many factors: the type of business they are
engaged in; the markets they are seeking to serve; the type of labour force
they need to attract; relative wage/real estate/utility and cost-of-living
expenses; transport and other infrastructure requirements; and available
government incentives.
Despite this wide range of variables, some broad trends can be identified.
One of the most significant is the growth of financial assistance packages
over the past few years as US states and municipalities try to woo
businesses. Jim Schriner, of PHH Fantus Consulting, a leading business
location advisory group, says: 'The incentive market is very hot right now
and will probably stay so for a couple of years.'
The most startling incentive package is that awarded by Alamaba to Mercedes:
an initial Dollars 253m, with tax breaks over 25 years that could be worth
an additional Dollars 230m.
More recently, the state of Iowa gave Ipsco, a Canadian steel group, a
package of tax and other incentives worth Dollars 73m over 20 years to
clinch the location of a steel mill. And last month Connecticut gave some
Dollars 120m of incentives over 10 years to persuade Swiss Bank Corporation
to move its US headquarters from Manhattan, New York, to the suburban city
of Stamford.
Despite the growth of incentives, most companies consider these towards the
end of their site search, as one of several factors which can tip the
balance between one area and another. Relocation advisory groups argue that
to focus on government concessions ahead of more fundamental business
factors is to risk making short-term judgments which could prove costly in
the long run.
More fundamental business location trends include a continuing shift of
businesses from city centres to surrounding suburbs.
Take, for example, Swiss Bank's recent decision to move to Stamford,
Connecticut, from New York city, and Mastercard's plan to move its
headquarters from Manhattan to New York state's nearby Westchester county.
In New York, this trend partly reflects rising Manhattan property rental
prices as the city recovers from the severe recession of 1989-1993. That, in
turn, underlines the fact that, despite the run of defections, cosmopolitan
New York remains a crucial centre for the financial services industry,
international trade and media industries.
That said, manufacturing and services industries that do not need to be in
the relatively costly north-eastern US are continuing to switch to less
expensive centres in the south, midwest and west.
And on the west coast, there is a trend for businesses to relocate from
California to fast-growing desert and Rocky Mountain states, notably
Arizona, Nevada and Utah. Many are leaving the expensive, socially-troubled
Los Angeles region.
Nafta is also starting to influence location decisions. Richard Greene, of
Ernst &amp; Young's international corporate real estate consulting service,
says: 'The biggest thing to have changed in the last couple of years is
Nafta. We are seeing foreign companies - Canadian and Mexican as well as
European and Asian - re-examining where in America to do business. They are
looking for the best place to access the entire North American market.'
Mr Schriner of PHH says that it has seen 'very little work resulting from
Nafta. Companies that want to be in Mexico already have a presence in
Mexico.'
But he adds that many companies are still organised on a country basis,
rather than a regional basis, with three separate corporate staffs for the
US, Canada and Mexico, and these will have to be cut eventually to one.
'Companies have not dealt with this yet, but they will have to.'
