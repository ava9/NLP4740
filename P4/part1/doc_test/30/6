American Medical International, saddled with debt from a $1.67-billion buyout 
completed in October, said Tuesday that it will leave its home in Beverly Hills 
for a more economical headquarters in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 employees in Beverly Hills will be affected by the move, which is to 
take place next September, the company said. Unaffected are another 200 
employees who work at AMI's data center near Marina del Rey and in insurance 
and benefits units in Costa Mesa.

<P>
The move will help foster "a new corporate culture that is reflective of the 
new AMI," Harry J. Gray, chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. The 
"new AMI, company officials have previously indicated, will stress leanness, 
given the debt burden resulting from its buyout. 
</P>
<P>
"Relocating our corporate headquarters to the Dallas area is prudent from 
economic, geographic and philosophic perspectives," Gray said. "Dallas 
represents significant cost savings over Beverly Hills. It is more central in 
relation to our hospitals, which are located across the Sun Belt." AMI 
officials said recently that the company would sell its 23 foreign hospitals 
and an undetermined number of its 48 U.S. hospitals to reduce debt. Other 
cost-cutting moves were announced then, including the intent to reduce the 
1,500-member administrative staff. 
</P>
<P>
About 60 employees in the Beverly Hills office were laid off recently, an AMI 
spokeswoman said. The company said it is developing incentive programs for 
employees offered a transfer to Dallas and would help place other employees. 
</P>
<P>
"We regret that this move means we will lose many valued employees," Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
AMI, founded in Los Angeles in 1956, was a pioneer of the for-profit hospital 
industry. It moved to Beverly Hills in 1973. Burdened by debt and squeezed by 
cost cutting in the federal Medicaid program in the 1980s, however, AMI and its 
competitors fell on hard times. 
</P>
<P>
The company was attempting a turnaround when it received a buyout offer in 
March. After a bidding contest, IMA Acquisition Corp., formed by First Boston 
Corp., Gray, and Mel Klein &amp; Partners -- a firm backed by Chicago's wealthy 
Pritzker family -- acquired the company in a deal valued at $1.67 billion, the 
second-most-costly buyout in the health-care industry.
