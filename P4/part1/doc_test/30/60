With their governor leading the charge, 40 officials from Oregon swooped down 
on California last week in a bold raid on the state's economic riches. 
</P>
<P>
The aggressive Oregonians called upon 70 firms in the Golden State and held a 
lavish reception at a downtown Los Angeles hotel -- where guests nibbled on 
Chinook salmon, sipped Oregon wines and watched videotaped testimonials -- in 
an effort to persuade companies to make the move north. 
</P>
<P>
"California is our No. 1 target," said Steve Petersen, deputy director of the 
Oregon Economic Development Department. "This is the first shot in a long-term 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
Oregon has joined the ranks of other states -- Arizona, Texas, Indiana and 
Colorado among them -- that want to boost their economies by taking home some 
of California's. This state's crowded and expensive cities have made it an 
attractive target for other regions that can promise businesses lower costs, 
tax incentives and congestion-free highways. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, many California officials seem more concerned about attracting 
business from the Far East than about losing companies to the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, California has rivaled -- even surpassed, some say -- the New 
York metropolitan area as the nation's most productive hunting ground for other 
cities and states hoping to attract disenchanted corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from about 20 states, cities and utilities crisscross 
California during any given month, according to corporate relocation experts. 
In fact, while the Oregonians were in Los Angeles last week, a competing 
contingent from the Reno area was also passing through town. 
</P>
<P>
California corporate expatriates have accounted for up to 35% of the annual 
business start-ups in Nevada. "We get fat from the crumbs off your table and 
you don't even know it," said Andy Grose, executive director of Nevada's 
economic development commission. 
</P>
<P>
Many argue that California is big and strong enough -- the Los Angeles area 
alone created nearly 165,000 jobs last year -- to survive economic assaults 
from other states. "Look at the job growth we are having," said Bob Arnold, 
chairman of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy. 
"It's just phenomenal. You will always see some spillover when you're this 
big." 
</P>
<P>
And that's just what many other states figure. "A lot of these states are 
getting hungry," said David Kolzow, an Orange County economic development 
consultant to cities. "And California has just continued to be a shining star 
in terms of economic growth." 
</P>
<P>
In high-profile delegations or two-member teams, officials from other states 
shop in California for specific companies. Houston wants to rebuild its economy 
-- badly weakened by low oil prices and a troubled real estate market -- with 
firms that would like to feed off its petrochemical industry and the nearby 
Johnson Space Center. Indiana wants high-tech firms to offset its reliance on 
heavy industry. Oregon's utilities are partial to big users of electrical 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, one official joked, "We'll take any of your fine companies." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the raiders offer incentives that California cannot match -- like 
forgiving taxes -- and will help find and train new employees, including top 
executives. They will videotape neighborhoods and industrial sites to help 
prospects make up their minds to move as well as try to match them to cities 
fitting their land and labor needs. 
</P>
<P>
Growing firms are prime targets for job-hungry states. Other states are more 
likely to pick the fruits of corporate expansion -- new factories and 
distribution centers, for example -- than to lure away entire corporations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're finding a lot of small companies that are interested in talking to us 
because of the quality of life," said George H. Gault, an official in 
Colorado's economic development office. "They are tired of too many people, too 
much pollution." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking Outside State 
</P>
<P>
It also helps when you are in a part of the country that is attractive to top 
managers. "If the owner likes to fish and hunt in the mountains, that's where 
the company goes," said Darrell Plummer, economic development representative 
for Sierra Pacific Resources, a Nevada utility holding company. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a major high-profile company does jump the state line. Motel 6 moved 
its headquarters, for example, from the beaches of Santa Barbara to the 
flatlands of Dallas, where the company says it is easier to keep tabs on the 
nationwide chain. 
</P>
<P>
The many problems spawned by California's success -- high operating costs, 
slow-growth regulations, pollution controls and traffic congestion -- make it 
easier to attract firms, say the economic development officials of other 
states. A recent study by Location Management Services, a Palo Alto firm that 
helps companies locate new homes, found that of Southern California firms 
planning to move or to build new plants outside the region, about 70% said they 
were looking at sites outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
"It became clear that we would have a greater rate of success in California 
than we would have in the Northeast," said R. Wayne Snead, marketing director 
for a Houston economic development group, who found at least three California 
firms willing to relocate while on a recent prospecting tour. 
</P>
<P>
California companies also seem more receptive to the idea of moving than do 
firms in other high-cost parts of the nation, like Massachussetts. "They've got 
such a Stone Age mentality there," said Fred S. Lindsey, an official with the 
Indiana Department of Commerce who recently completed a two-week hunt for 
California high-tech firms. "They think anything west of Pennsylvania is still 
wild. They will tolerate the high cost of everything." 
</P>
<P>
But there is resistance. "Some of the Californians don't care what it is they 
are doing as long as they are doing it in California," Snead said. Houston has 
"a lot to offer, a lot of diversity. But we don't have the mountains with 
snow." 
</P>
<P>
And local California officials have been known to give a frosty reception to 
these economic prospectors. "I'm sure they are not too happy about us coming 
into their areas," said Oregon's Petersen. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, California offered little in the way of an organized 
counterattack to keep firms from moving or expanding across the state line. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the economic development programs are really not geared much to 
retaining business," said Kolzow, who himself is moving from Orange County to 
Dallas. And the public's attitude, he says, is often: "Who cares if they move 
out? They just cause congestion and pollution." 
</P>
<P>
California officials concede that they have their work cut out for them. "It's 
worrisome if I find that sometimes they (California firms) know more about what 
Arizona has to offer than what California has to offer," said Janet Turner, 
director of business development for the State Department of Commerce. "We're 
trying to make sure California firms know what opportunities exist within 
California." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Great Potential' 
</P>
<P>
The state has identified several industries that it wants to retain and are 
vulnerable to moving, including companies in aerospace, furniture making, 
apparel and plastics. Through industry associations, surveys and meetings, the 
state tries to find out who might leave and offer solutions and alternatives to 
unhappy corporations. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the department was tipped off that Los Angeles apparel maker Evy 
of California was ready to sign a lease for a new plant near Salt Lake City. 
Turner said the state recommended that Evy contact officials in several 
low-cost California towns. As a result, Evy opened a plant in Bakersfield in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
"Utah was excellent," said Evy President Kurt Krieser. "They were willing to do 
a lot, and there was a lot of building space." But after looking at 
Bakersfield, Krieser found that the city offered many of the low-cost benefits 
that Utah did and was several hundred miles closer to company headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"The agency showed us that there is great potential here," Krieser said. 
</P>
<P>
California has also won praise for its advertising campaign -- Discover the 
Californias -- that has helped raise awareness among business people 
nationwide. State officials also make annual corporate recruiting trips to New 
York and the Boston area and will soon begin making treks to Chicago, Turner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many California officials are not so inclined. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, for example, has arranged trips to 
Kuala Lumpur and Britain to drum up investment here, but has all but ignored 
other parts of the United States. "We haven't concentrated in that area quite 
frankly," chamber President Ray Remy said. "We are interested in the 
international markets." 
</P>
<P>
And many argue that California -- rich and congested enough already -- should 
not trouble itself to go after new business. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're going five miles an hour on the San Diego Freeway," said Indiana's 
Lindsey, "who needs to go out and advertise?"
