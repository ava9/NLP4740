  [Text] Amman--Heads of the delegations of member states to 
the 17th ministerial session of the U.N. Economic and Social 
Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) Monday voted to relocate the 
commission's headquarters from Amman to Beirut. 
  Informed sources told the JORDAN TIMES that the votes in 
favour of the move to Lebanon were made by Saudi Arabia, the 
United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Syria, Kuwait, Egypt and 
Lebanon. 
  ESCWA headquarters was initially situated in Beirut, but was 
moved to Baghdad after the outbreak of the Lebanese civil war. 
It was then moved to Amman in the aftermath of the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. 
  Iraq, voted alone to return the headquarters to Baghdad, 
said 
the sources. 
  Qatar voted to have the headquarters located in Doha, and 
Oman abstained from the voting. 
  Votes in favour of maintaining the commission's headquarters 
in Amman, according to sources, were cast by Yemen, Palestine 
and Jordan. 
  Jordan sought to call for a postponement of the vote, but of 
the seven votes needed to move to postponement, explained the 
sources, only six were cast in favour. A yes vote for 
postponement by Egypt would have tipped the balance for Jordan, 
added the sources. 
  According to the sources, the committee which reported to 
the 
closed meeting expressed apprehensions and reservations about 
moving the headquarters out of Jordan. 
  The move, sources said, is expected to take place in two 
years. 
  Earlier, participants to the ESCWA ministerial session 
discussed the restructuring and revitalisation of the United 
Nations in the economic and social fields, revision of the 
medium term plan for the period 1992-1997 and revision of the 
programme of work and priorities for the biennium 1996-1997. 
  During discussions on the designation of sectoral focal 
points of the commission's economic and social development 
programme, participants agreed that a general coordination plan 
between member states and their governments has to be structured. 
  "It is agreed that we need to establish bridges of 
communications between the concerned parties" to make possible 
the application of ESCWA programmes, said Minister of Planning 
Ziyad Fariz who is heading the session. 
  Iraqi, Syrian, Egyptian and Qatari representatives stressed 
the importance of making comprehensive research studies on the 
exploitation of water in the region, saying that the issue of 
water management is one of the most vital points in the regions' 
economic relations. 
  Also on Monday's agenda was the financial status of the 
commission's programmes. 
  ESCWA Chief Administration John Truman said the initial 
appropriations for ESCWA's regular budget for the biennium 
1992-1993 approved by the General Assebly amounted to $US 
50,660,600. In 1993, he added, the commission estimated a 
saving of $US 12,432,700 from this initial appropriation. 
  They include "a freeze on recruitment, restrictions on 
travel 
of staff on official business, restrictions on the hiring of 
consultants, differences in post-adjustment for the professional 
staff between Iraq and Jordan, and differences in General 
Service salary scale between Iraq and Jordan." 
  The increasingly serious financial crisis faced by the 
United 
Nations in recent years is clearly reflected in the decreasing 
amounts allocated to ESCWA by the major sources of 
extrabudgetary funds, Mr. Truman said. The major sources of 
extrabudgetary funds for the past four bienniums have been the 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations 
Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Development Fund for 
Women (UNIFEM), the government of the Netherlands and the 
government of France. 
  Yet, contributions from these sources have steadily 
declined. 
In the biennium 1992-1993, these resources amount to $US 
1,218,350. 
  The financial situation of the regular budget was also 
addressed. Mr. Truman stressed the need for member states to 
"pay their contributions as soon as possible," as the financial 
situation is only manageable until August 1994. 
  The work of the 17th sesion, which addresses economic and 
social development programmes for its 13 member states, will be 
concluded today after delegations from the representative 
countries adopt the report of the commission on the session.
