greatly - Property and labour markets

THE costs and availability of property and labour rank among the top
concerns of companies considering relocations.
Property costs can vary greatly depending on whether a company is looking to
locate a manufacturing plant, find a headquarters or regional office or set
up a distribution warehouse. Yet, no matter the type of facility, shifts in
the US property market have occurred that have affected and will affect
property prices.
Two factors have wreaked havoc with the US property market over the past few
years: the overhang in supply of commercial properties from excessive
building during the 1980s and a decline in demand stemming from the US
recession and continued economic sluggishness.
Although the building boom of the 1980s is over, some cities overbuilt more
office space than others and some, such as Chicago which arrived late to the
party, have recently faced substantial and badly timed additions to their
office property inventories.
In 1991, after the economy had run out of steam, Chicago added 3.4m square
feet of commercial property and saw its central business district vacancy
rate rise to 22.3 per cent from 17.6 per cent between the second quarter of
this year and the same period last year, according to figures from Cushman &amp;
Wakefield, a top US commercial property firm.
Vacancy rates can push rental costs up or down. In the central business
district of Los Angeles, the vacancy rate rose to 29.2 per cent in the
second quarter from 22.6 a year before and rental costs declined from a
range of Dollars 20-42 per square foot to Dollars 17-40.
In addition to lower prices, more vacant space can also mean tenants can win
fatter concessions from landlords for outfitting the space or grace periods
at the start of the lease.
Even with little additional building, the cost of property has been driven
down in some areas by lack of demand. Areas such as New England and the
Mid-Atlantic states, including such states as New York and Pennsylvania,
have been hard hit by the US economy's downturn and the consolidation of the
securities and banking industries.
On the opposite coast, the computer and defence industries that were once
the engines powering California's growth have been shrinking painfully over
the past two years and, at least for defence, will continue to do so.
But as testimony to the gravity of the US recession, the national vacancy
rate has continued to climb for central business districts even though the
amount of newly added space in those areas has declined every year since
1986.
However, this trend has been accompanied by a shift away from central
business districts. More and more companies are choosing to set up in the
suburban areas immediately surrounding large or mid-sized cities or to
forsake cities for more rural locations, particularly for greenfield plants.
BMW, for example, selected Spartanburg, South Carolina for its new assembly
plant.
In greenfield sites, it is virtually worthless to cite property costs, since
these frequently are a bargaining chip in negotiations with a relocating
company. Often the site itself can cost nothing or very little.
The flight from the inner cities has partly been spurred by costs, but it
also has much to do with quality of life issues - such as schools, housing,
parks and recreation.
The northern suburbs of Atlanta, for example, have been ranked as the number
one preferred location by a series of surveys, including that of Ernst &amp;
Young with the International Association of Corporate Real Estate Executives
which was published earlier this year.
The area's amenities, and most particularly the relatively reasonable cost
of housing, has convinced a number of large companies to relocate there
recently, including UPS.
The cost of living for employees is important for companies partly because
of what kinds of salaries and wages will be required at the new site.
Runzheimer International, a Wisconsin-based consulting firm on living and
travel costs, calculates that Dollars 60,000 is the standard compensation
for a middle management employee or a highly skilled technician.
Based on a family of four, with a mortgaged home and two cars, companies
would have to vary their compensation levels according to location. They
would have to pay employees more to settle in Los Angeles, with total annual
costs of Dollars 77,454, than in Memphis, where costs run to just Dollars
55,492 a year.
For companies seeking reasonably priced manufacturing labour, the US's
south-east continues to offer the best value with an average of just Dollars
9.77 per hour, according to figures compiled by PHH Fantus, the leading US
relocation consulting firm. Yet in spite of the lower averages of wages in
the region, two of the south-east's states, South Carolina and Georgia, have
innovative public programmes to train employees for incoming investors.
Mr Robert Ady, president of PHH Fantus, said that foreign firms often
overestimate the skill level of American workers. He advises them to
realistically appraise local worker capabilities.
South Carolina's programme to train BMW workers was, he said, crucial to its
choice of that state.
With the North American Free Trade Agreement on the horizon, however, those
whose top priority is to set up in a low wage location are likely to go to
Mexico.

Based on a family of four with a Dollars 60,000 annual income, living
in a 2,400 sq ft home which carries a mortgage and incurring all normal
home ownership and maintenance costs. The family owns two cars: a late
model driven 14,000 miles a year and a four-year-old model driven 6,000
miles yearly. Car expenses include both fixed and operating costs.
Federal, state and local income taxes are paid. They also pay sales
taxes and purchase goods and services typical for a family in their
income bracket at their location. The family has also set aside an
amount for investments and savings. Costing is based on representative
communities surrounding the core city in which families earning Dollars
60,000 a year are most likely to reside.
