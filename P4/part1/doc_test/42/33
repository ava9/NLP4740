If the hairs on the back of your neck rise at the words 'I'll be leaving
Cape Horn to starboard' then you will want to watch Sea Challenge (8.15
BBC2). Even today, with the Whitbread Race ensuring that people now round
the Horn in something like a procession, for anyone who sails there is still
something magical and threatening about the very name of the famous
landmark. This programme tells the story of Mike Golding's triumphant
attempt to cut 100 days off Chay Blyth's 1971 record of 292 days for a
widdershins circumnavigation of the globe. Among the many Radio 5 Live
programmes concerned with neither sport nor news is Arthur Smith On The
Floor in which the best of the alternative comedian comperes visits
different universities for student debates, today: Sunderland (9.05). Radio
3's new series Where Are They Now? begins with John Stanley, a blind
organist, contemporary of Handel, whose prolific composition was once highly
regarded (9.40). The first episode in a new Book At Bedtime, 'Piggy In The
Middle' by Paula McKay, is read by Miriam Margolyes (10.45 Radio 4).
