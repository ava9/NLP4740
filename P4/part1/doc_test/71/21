  [Excerpt] A Military correspondent of the Bakhtar 
Information Agency reported to us that commander of Imam Qotaiba 
Brigade associated with Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of 
Afghanistan] called the unholy alliance of Golboddin with Dostam 
and Karmal a treacherous and anti-Islamic act. He cut off links 
with Golboddin's militia and joined [words indistinct] in 
Baghlan Province along with 500 people and 50 pieces of heavy 
weapons. Mulla Abdurrahim, commander Abdol Wali, commander 
Jalal, commander Mirza Rahim and commander Abdol Hanan are among 
those who have joined the jihad. These commanders have severed 
their links with Golboddin's militia and play their Islamic role 
on the side of the Islamic army's forces and mojahedin in the 
war of right against wrong. As many as 100 armed men of Unit 
10 under the command of Mohammadollah Nader in Poza-e Eshan in 
Baghlan Province have joined Jihadi Division 20. According to a 
report by correspondent of Bakhtar Information Agency, the unit 
was associated with Brigade 4 of the anti-Islamic Movement of 
Kamal-Dostam militia. They have joined the Islamic army 
voluntarily in order to take part in the crushing of the enemies 
of Islam. Mohammadollah Nader, commander of the unit, in a 
speech said: For the independence of the country and for jihad 
and campaign against the enemies of Islam, Karmal, Dostam and 
Golboddin, we are ready for self-sacrifice. [passage omitted]
