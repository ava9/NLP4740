<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Mohammad Gol Aryubwal, </F>
deputy defense minister, by unidentified correspondent in Kabul; 
date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Correspondent] Esteemed Lieutenant General 
Mohammad Gol Aryubwal, deputy defense minister of the Islamic 
State of Afghanistan, I thank you for receiving us for the 
interview. I would like to ask you -- since we are now 
completing the second anniversary of the Islamic revolution -- 
since the fall of the previous regime and the disintegration of 
its arme, the country has had a new national Islamic Army. 
Could you please give us information about the organization and 
ideological work in the Army? 
  [Aryubwal] In the name of God the compassionate, the 
merciful. As you said, the Army of Afghanistan disintegrated. 
It was an organized plan of the longstanding enemies of 
Afghanistan. For ages they planned to destroy the national 
treasures of Afghanistan -- the national archive of Afghanistan, 
the museums, and to eliminate the Afghan institutions -- to 
destroy the national Army of Afghanistan -- and with the 
implementation of that plan Afghanistan was faced with a strange 
situation which is the cause of the sorrow of every Afghan, 
every Muslim, every patriot. Through their servants they took 
all Afghan treasures to their countries. In practice now there 
is nothing in Afghanistan. 
  But although Afghanistan was confronted with a civil war by 
those enemies of its freedom, the Islamic State of Afghanistan 
was able to establish such an army to at least defend the 
national honor of Afghanistan, that is to safeguard its national 
unity and national sovereignty. And despite the problems 
created for it by the enemies, the Afghan Army has been able to 
protect national sovereignty and national unity and to abort 
many of the enemies' conspiracies. As I said before despite the 
fact that the Army is faced with big problems -- for a single 
moment the Afghan Army has not been allowed to be 
self-confident, to think about itself -- yet, thanks God, a 
large number of patriotic and nationalist trained officers, from 
every class, every stratum, every profession came together and 
organized themselves. As a result of this organization, thus 
far several conspiracies, created especially by [word 
indistinct] enemies of Afghanistan about which the world knows, 
have been aborted by this Army, and God willing so far as 
possible it will defend the national honor of the country at any 
moment, day and night. 
  From the ideological point of view too the Islamic Army is 
progressing and attention has been paid to the ideological life 
of the Army. Courses have been set up and work continues. It 
is hoped that when the Afghan Army can rest for a while it is 
expected of it to [words indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] Unfortunately since the victory of the 
Islamic revolution there had been fighting in various directions 
in Afghanistan. Recent incidents would have caused very grave 
consequences, but the mojahedin and officials of our Islamic 
Army were able to prevent those grave incidents. Please shed 
some light on the activities and the share of the officials and 
units of the Islamic Army and mojahedin in the dislodging of the 
recent incidents. 
  [Aryubwal] As I said before, the longstanding enemies of 
Afghanistan have not for a moment allowed the Afghan nation, 
Army, and state to dress Afghanistan's wounds so as to take care 
of its affairs and pay attention to its national unity and 
reconstruction. [Words indistinct] especially after the recent 
conspiracy this heroic, Muslim and patriotic Army, which cannot 
even be called an army compared with other armies, was able to 
abort a dangerous conspiracy, a coup d'etat. Not only did it 
abort the coup d'etat, but it also gained many victories, which 
are a cause of pride for this Army. Military experts can 
understand the fact that an army, which even cannot be called an 
army, was able to abort such a dangerous coup d'etat that was 
supported by many foreign powers, and to capture many areas from 
the enemies. 
  For example since the failed coup d'etat of 11 Jadi [1 
January] this Army has cleared up bravely the area of the 
airport, where previously militia forces resided, and the areas 
of Qabelbai, Hudkhel, Banayi, Alokhel, Milli Bus, Microrayon 
Bridge, the area of Idgah mosque, the surroundings of Balahesar, 
Maiwand Wat, [east and south of Kabul] the surroundings of 
Bagh-e Babor, the surrounding of Dehmazang, the cultural area of 
Kabul, and many other areas in Kabul. 
  Outside Kabul many victories have been achieved. For 
instance, Parwan Province has been completely cleared of the 
enemies and many positions have been conquered. The enemy is in 
very small area of Kapisa Province, God willing, and in a short 
time that area will also be cleared [words indistinct]. In 
northern areas such as in Faryab Province many areas have been 
cleared of the militia. The area of Pol-e Khomri [in Baghlan] 
is completely cleared. Northern Salang, Khinjan, Doshi, 
Samangan Province, and the districts of Balkh Province have been 
conquered. In the near future we will hear about other 
conquests too. [passage omitted]
