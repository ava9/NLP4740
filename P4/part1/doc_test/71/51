  [Text] An abortive attack by the infamous militia of 
Karmal-Dostam-Hekmatyar, which was launched last night from the 
direction of Qabelbay and Yakatut [east of Kabul] on positions 
of the Islamic Army, has been repulsed. A responsible source of 
the General Command of Kabul Garrison reported to a BAKHTAR 
INFORMATION AGENCY military correspondent that last night's 
attack of the infamous militia of Golboddin and Dostam, who have 
been disappointed by their continued defeats, met -- as on 
previous occasions -- with strong resistance of mojahedin and 
the Islamic Army of Afghanistan. The raiders were forced to 
retreat. As a result of this abortive attack a number of the 
infamous militia were either killed or injured, and a quantity 
of their ammunition such as 82mm artillery shells, mortar 
shells, and rockets have been taken as booty. 
  In retaliation for the failure of their assault, the 
infamous 
militia again targeted residential areas. Five residences were 
destroyed as a a result of the firing of ten rockets by them. 
No loss of life was reported from the rocket attack.
