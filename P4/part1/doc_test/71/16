  [Text] Mr. 'Ala'eddin Borujerdi, deputy foreign minister of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran who has recently come to Kabul, in 
an interview with a Bakhtar Information Agency correspondent, 
said: We have no specific plan for the solution of 
Afghanistan's current problems. As a result of meetings and 
talks, however, we learned that all sides reject fighting, and 
this is a point that raises hope for the future. 
  Borujerdi said he met with esteemed Professor Borhanoddin 
Rabbani, president of Afghanistan; esteemed Ahmad Shah Masud 
[chairman of the Kabul City Security Commission]; esteemed Dr. 
Najibollah Lafra'i, minister of state for foreign affairs; and 
esteemed Hekmatyar. He said he conducted useful talks with them 
on the current changes in the country. 
  The deputy foreign minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
also said his visit to Kabul has taken place on the basis of 
good neighborliness. He said: On my suggestion, Hekmatyar 
agreed to give electricity to Kabul for four hours a day. He 
expressed the hope that a solution could also be found for 
getting food to Kabul. 
  Answering another question, Mr. Borujerdi said: The economic 
cooperation agreements signed by both countries are being 
implemented, and cooperation is being carried out in the secured 
areas of the country. In response to another question, 
Borujerdi said: Afghanistan's Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami can resolve 
its internal problems itself. I did meet with Mr. Mazari and 
Mr. Akbari. The problems of Hezb-e Wahdat Eslami, however, are 
this party's own problems. I am confident it will find [words 
indistinct] to resolve them. We are ready to help to resolve 
their problems [words indistinct].
