  [Text] The press department of the presidency told the 
Bakhtar Information Agency that the country's president, 
esteemed Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani, received a 
decision-making council [da tasmim newalo shura] of Kabul's 
mosques, Takia Khanas [Shiite prayer places], ulemas, and elders 
this afternoon. 
  Opening the meeting, a few verses were read out by one of 
the 
ulema and then esteemed Mawlawi Ataurrahman introduced members 
of the decision-making council to the esteemed president of the 
Islamic State of Afghanistan. 
  Then, Hojjat ol-Eslam Walmoslemin Khodadad Erfani spoke 
about 
the coup attempt by a group of criminals and said: 
  Criminal communists once again, in collaboration with the 
hypocrite Golboddin, soiled their hands with the blood of the 
innocent and Muslim people of Afghanistan. Hekmatyar is a 
hypocrite element of our era who destroyed Kabul due to the 
existence of militia in the past. Distinction between the 
militia and Golboddin is now difficult to make. 
  Hojjat ol-Eslam Erfani also said that the Sunni and Shi'ia 
ulema of Afghanistan have expressed support for the declared 
jihad by the president of Afghanistan. He considered jihad 
against militia and communists as the duty of every Muslim. 
  Then esteemed Mawlawi Ruhani and Mawlawi Kefayatollah spoke 
in turn and considered jihad against the militia as a duty to 
God. 
  The esteemed president then praised the role of ulema during 
the era of jihad and said: It is without any doubt that, under 
the present conditions, the faithful ulema have taken their 
resolute stand. This means that the conscience of our nation is 
awake and your meeting is indicative of the national and 
religious unity of our country.
