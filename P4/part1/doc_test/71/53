  [Text] Presided over by esteemed acting Attorney General 
Sayd Abdorrazaq Mosamem, the session of the Consultative Council 
of the attorney general was held today. After a comprehensive 
discussion on issues the following points were approved. 
  1. All jihadi organizations, political parties, political 
and national leaders and personalities of the country are aware 
that foreigners cannot resolve our people's and country's 
problems. The oppressive and ruthless battles of armed 
aggressors also cannot be a solution. Therefore, all of us will 
believe in the following order of God: If you differ in 
anything among yourselves, refer to God and his Apostle, and to 
adhere to what are Islamic principles and laws in the eyes of 
almighty God and Islamic principles are acted upon in the 
country. 
  2. Under Article 42 of the law of courts' jurisdiction and 
organization, and Articles 397 and 399 of the penal law, and 
Article 433 of the law of civil litigation, the resolution of 
the high council of the Supreme Court -- the highest and last 
authority of the judiciary of the country -- dated 18 Hout 1372 
[9 March 1994], which is in keeping with the principles of 
Mohammadan shariya and the laws of the country, on the election 
of the president by the representatives of the people in the 
Settlement and Solution Council is enforceable, and violation 
from it and its nonobservance is considered a crime, which is 
punishable under Article 285 of the penal law. Public 
prosecutors are obliged, in line with their duties, to deal with 
the violator in accordance with the law, in case of violation 
from the resolution of the judiciary, which is based on the 
distinguished religion of Islam. 
  3. The Afghan problem is under serious consideration and 
negotiations by domestic and international bodies. Those views 
and resolutions will be accepted provided they entail the high 
interests of our country and the will of the majority of the 
citizens of the country. Otherwise they will not be acceptable. 
  4. Highway security posts of jihadi forces, the Ministry of 
Defense, the Department of National Security, and police 
officials are reminded to pay serious attention to the 
prevention of trafficking of ancient and historic artifacts and 
to introduce the violators to the attorney general of the 
Islamic state in order that legal steps are taken for their 
prosecution in line with the laws.
