  [Excerpts] President Rabbani has expressed his readiness to 
hand over power to a council of people's representatives. He 
refused to hand in his resignation in order to avoid a power 
vacuum in the country and said: Because a council formed of 
nine jehadi leaders is not sufficient to find the solution to 
country's problems, representatives of the people will also 
participate in the council. After failing to achieve a victory 
against the Islamic state and the failure of his coup d'etat, 
Golboddin persistently insists that Rabbani was appointed to the 
presidency under the Jalalabad agreement, and thus will 
relinquish power after his term expires. In response, the 
Afghan president has said that he does not insist on staying in 
power, and whenever a council is formed of the real 
representatives of the nation, he is ready to hand over power to 
them. [passage indistinct] On the one hand Golboddin alleges 
that no government exists and therefore is not in control 
anywhere. However, the people of Afghanistan, and especially 
the people of Kabul, recently saw the broad gathering of 
governors and jehadi personalities from different provinces. It 
is not clear why Golboddin cannot see this real and complete 
power. [passage omitted] He accuses the council, which is to be 
held in a few days, and continues his crimes as in the past. In 
order to satisfy himself even for a few moments and to forget 
the bitter memories of all his weaknesses and defeats, Golboddin 
bestows upon himself the presidency of the state of Afghanistan, 
and declares, completely shamelessly, that he is ready to 
relinquish the office of premiership. It is not known to which 
premiership he is referring. It is clear that Golboddin knows 
what he means more than anyone else, and knows how laughable his 
words are. Why has a person who kneels before the dirtiest 
figure in history [Dostam] and does not refrain from 
subservience to others for power, agreed to step down from the 
premiership? The best thing for Golboddin is to learn from the 
past. Because the removal of Ahmad Shah Masud from the Ministry 
of Defense did not help him, he will not benefit from handing 
over power to the representatives of the nation. The nation's 
representatives can very well distinguish a national personality 
from a foreigner's servant and can separate good and bad. 
Confidently, the upcoming choice of a national council will be 
nothing else.
