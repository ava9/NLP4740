  [Text] Over the past 24 hours 131 rockets were fired into 
residential areas of Kabul. According to a report of the Kabul 
garrison command, the rockets were fired into the city from the 
directions of Balahesar and Maranjan Hill. As a result four 
defenseless residents of the city were martyred and 10 others 
were injured. 
  According to another report, positions of the Islamic army 
were attacked yesterday evening west of Kabul. A security 
source considered the internecine clashes of Hezb-e Wahdat over 
the appointment of the future party leader as the reason for the 
attack. The report adds that the adventurist section of Hezb-e 
Wahdat wants to hide its internal problems from the public by 
fanning conflict between the Islamic Army and Hezb-e Wahdat. 
However, Islamic Army units have been emphatically instructed 
to exercise forbearance before such provocations.
