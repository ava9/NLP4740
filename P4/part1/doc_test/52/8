After taking a brief look at Venus, the Galileo spacecraft is speeding toward a 
close encounter with Earth Dec. 8 on its long journey to Jupiter and it is 
expected to hit its desired course almost on the button, scientists reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists had tried to block the launch of Galileo last year because 
its instruments draw their energy from nuclear power, and some feared that a 
launch failure or a subsequent collision with Earth could release deadly 
radioisotopes into the atmosphere. But there is no chance of that, scientists 
said, because Galileo will be within about 16 miles of its desired course, 
passing 590 miles over the surface of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo will make an even closer Earth flyby in two years, passing less than 
200 miles from the planet on its way to its ultimate destination, Jupiter. But 
nothing about the spacecraft has given officials with the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration anything to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
"The spacecraft's health is excellent," said Galileo project manager William J. 
O'Neil of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo is functioning so well that "we don't have to do anything on the ground 
or anything on the spacecraft" to successfully zip by the Earth and use gravity 
to boost its speed by about 15,000 m.p.h. That is one of several maneuvers that 
Galileo will go through in order to reach Jupiter, where it will conduct a 
two-year study of the Jovian system. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, plans did not call for Galileo to fly past either Venus or Earth, 
but a new course had to be developed after changes in the space program 
resulting from the Challenger disaster precluded the use of a rocket powerful 
enough to send it on a direct course to Jupiter. So both Venus and Earth are 
bonuses along the way, and scientists expect to make full use of both 
opportunities to study planets that are very similar in some ways, but quite 
different in others. 
</P>
<P>
The Earth flyby will be unique in that, for the first time, a spacecraft will 
reveal the Earth as it would appear to an alien spacecraft flying through the 
solar system. The flyby is expected to produce some first-ever pictures of the 
Earth and the moon. 
</P>
<P>
"We will see portions of the far side of the moon that have never been looked 
at with modern sensors," said Torrence V. Johnson of JPL, the project 
scientist. 
</P>
<P>
The images that Galileo will send back as it speeds toward Earth, as well as 
the thousands of photographs it will take of Jupiter and that planet's moons, 
could be exceptionally rewarding because the camera aboard Galileo is capable 
of creating extremely sharp images in very low light, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Michael Belton, leader of the imaging team, Galileo's camera is 
about 100 times as sensitive to light as the cameras that sent back spectacular 
images from the two Voyagers as they explored the outer reaches of the solar 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo's visit to Venus has been upstaged by JPL's Magellan spacecraft, which 
uses a radar camera to pierce through the sulfur dioxide clouds that hide the 
planet's surface, but at least it gave scientists a chance to check out their 
instruments and pick up a little precious data on the brilliant white planet. 
</P>
<P>
The data, collected in February, was stored aboard the spacecraft until last 
week, when Galileo was close enough to Earth to transmit it back. Scientists 
have spent the last few days devouring the information. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas came early this year," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
And there were a few surprises. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Galileo's instruments detected a concentration of electrons 
traveling at far higher speeds than would have been expected. 
</P>
<P>
The electrons apparently were accelerated to the extraordinary speeds because 
of some "interaction" of Venus with the million-mile-an-hour wind blowing off 
the sun. Asked the significance of the discovery, Louis Frank of the University 
of Iowa, head of the plasma science team, said: 
</P>
<P>
"It shows our ignorance of how to push particles around the solar system." 
</P>
<P>
The photos of Venus taken by Galileo do not rival the sharp radar images that 
Magellan has been sending back for the last few weeks, but scientists embraced 
them anyway because they reveal additional details about the clouds that cover 
Venus. That, in turn, is important because it gives scientists a chance to 
study the atmosphere of a planet that evolved quite differently from the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"We are living in an atmosphere that we are changing," Belton said, referring 
to the global warming effect that many scientists believe is taking place on 
Earth. "If you don't want the Earth to change into something like that (Venus), 
then you better learn about atmospheres." 
</P>
<P>
Venus has an atmosphere that is rich in carbon dioxide, so it has already 
experienced the greenhouse effect. It is also devoid of life.
