  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat last night signed an agreement in Cairo concluding 
the arrangements at the border crossings and the security 
arrangements in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The size of the 
Jericho area will be decided upon in a meeting between Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. Israel 
and the Palestinians also agreed on several security issues, on 
the powers of the Palestinian authority under autonomy, and on a 
number of other disputed issues. The agreement and the 
accompanying maps were signed by Foreign Ministry Director 
General Uri Savir and PLO representative Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad 
Quray']. The foreign minister and the PLO chairman added their 
signatures. 
  Our correspondent in Cairo Moti Amir reports that the signed 
agreement will be valid for one year after which a committee 
established by both parties will be able to reexamine it. As 
for the Gaza Strip, the parties last night agreed that it would 
have three settlement areas which would also contain the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] bases responsible for the Jewish 
settlers' security. Major General 'Uzi Dayan clarified that 
Israel would retain exclusive responsibility for the east-west 
roads which the settlers would use to drive from the Gaza Strip 
into Israel. The areas on the side of the road would be under 
Israeli responsibility in coordination with the Palestinians. 
Israeli security forces would have the right to act against any 
elements who either seek to harm or actually attack Israelis 
moving on the agreed upon roads. At a certain stage, the 
Palestinians will assume responsibility for the pursuit of the 
perpetrators. 
  Israel will retain full control of the border area in the 
Gaza Strip, as well as full responsibility for the security 
arrangements at the Rafah border crossing. On the Allenby 
Bridge, Israel will have the inviolable right to check any 
person crossing the bridge from Jordan and will be authorized to 
prevent the entry of any undesirable individual. Those barred 
entry will not be permitted to appeal the decision. An Israeli 
security guard will be stationed on the bridge. There will be 
two inspection rooms at the border terminal, one room for Israel 
and the other for the Palestinians. The agreement also 
stipulates arrangements for the Jericho area but the size of 
this area will be decided upon during the meeting between 
Yitzhaq Rabin and Yasir 'Arafat. 
  Egyptian President Husni Mubarak welcomed the agreement. He 
telephoned Prime Minister Rabin and invited him to visit Egypt. 
Mr. Rabin thanked the Egyptians for their contribution to the 
peace process and said he would gladly visit Egypt after the 
implementation of the agreement with the Palestinians had begun. 
Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reported that the prime 
minister approved all the details of the agreement. The chief 
of staff, the deputy chief of staff, the head of the 
Intelligence Branch, and the director of the Shin Bet arrived at 
the prime minister's bureau, examined every detail of the 
agreement, and conveyed their approval to Cairo. Our political 
correspondent reports that the military, civilian, and economic 
talks will resume next week in Taba and Paris. The two parties 
will also discuss the issue of the Gaza Strip roads in detail at 
the Taba talks. 
  Our army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that 
the IDF will be capable of withdrawing from the Gaza Strip and 
the Jericho area within one month if it is required to do so. 
Army sources nevertheless asserted that an additional 300 
million shekels, on top of the already authorized sum of 250 
million shekels, would be required to finance the redeployment.
