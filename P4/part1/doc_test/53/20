  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, April 3 (AFP) -- 
Israeli troops completed their evacuation of the largest 
military base in Gaza City on Sunday [3 April] after emptying 
its prison, Palestinian officials said. 
  Witnesses said an armoured vehicle and a truck were the last 
equipment driven out of the "Seafront" army camp as Israel and 
the PLO resumed talks in Cairo to try to launch autonomous rule 
in Gaza and Jericho within 10 days. 
  A couple of soldiers however remained in a look-out post and 
border police were on duty outside the base know as "Hof" in 
Hebrew. 
  PLO officials, who refused to be named, said the last 
prisoners in the jail at the camp had been moved to other 
facilities. Until early March 200 men were held at the prison, 
known to Palestinians as "Ansar II". 
  The army first began removing soldiers and materiel from the 
Seafront base in November. 
  The army steadfastly refuses to confirm details of any 
pullout, but the first Palestinian policemen are expected to be 
deployed in the territories during the coming week. 
  Palestinian witnesses also said equipment including an 
electronic gate had been dismantled at the army headquarters 
nearby in the centre of Gaza City. 
  Activity at the sprawling HQ appeared to have been reduced 
to 
a minimum, they said, noting a drastic reduction in the usually 
constant comings and goings. 
  Israeli forces are set to pull back to three core areas on 
the Gaza Strip from where they will maintain security for the 
4,000 Jewish settlers who are set to remain on the strip under 
the September 13 autonomy agreement. 
  In the aftermath of the February 25 Hebron mosque massacre, 
the PLO and Israel have pledged to speed up the implementation 
of Palestinian self-rule. 
  Meanwhile Israeli police also started a pullout from Jericho 
on Sunday, but under a hail of stones from Palestinian youths, 
an AFP correspondent reported. 
  A police spokesman confirmed that equipment had been taken 
out, but said the 18 Israeli policemen and five Palestinian 
employees would remain in place in Jericho for the time being. 
  And as part of the Cairo security accord package under which 
160 lightly-armed foreign observers are to be deployed in 
Hebron, the Israeli military restored Mustafa al-Natshah as 
mayor of Hebron on Sunday, more than 10 years after abolishing 
his role.
