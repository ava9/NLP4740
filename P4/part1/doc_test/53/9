  [Text] Cairo, May 17 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher today pledged international support for the 
fledgling Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank area of Jericho 
and the Gaza Strip while visiting the self-rule area, reports 
reaching here said. 
  Christopher, the first foreign VIP to tour the self-rule 
area 
since Palestinian police took over control, said that the U.S. 
had pledged 500 million dollars in aid to the autonomy 
government over the next five years, and had started to equip 
Palestinian police with 200 U.S. Army vehicles apart from 
helping rehabilitate hospitals and schools there. 
  "Much remains to be done and one of the reasons that I came 
here today is to make it clear to our Palestinian friends that 
they have supporters," he said amid tight security. 
  "I must say that it is a tremendous thrill to see the 
Palestinian police patrolling, to see the joint patrols, to see 
the administrators begin to take over," the U.S. official told 
reporters at the Jericho Police Station, which the Palestinian 
police took over Friday [13 May]. 
  Faisal Husseini [name as received], one of the members of 
the 
Palestinian governing authority, expressed welcome to 
Christopher's visit to Jericho, saying it is the first step 
toward building a new Palestine. 
  Also today, Israel formally handed over the government of 
the 
Gaza Strip to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), 
although Israeli soldiers still remain in parts of the strip to 
be turned over to the Palestinians. 
  Zakaria al-Agha [name as received], a member of the 
Palestinian authority that will govern the strip and Jericho, 
and Israeli Major General Dov Gazit signed a two-page document 
to accomplish the transfer of power. No ceremony was held for 
the takeover. 
  A similar handover of power in Jericho took place Friday. 
Under the accord signed in Cairo two weeks ago, Israel is to 
pull out of Jericho and Gaza, handing the areas over to 
Palestinian self-rule. 
  Christopher, who is shuttling between Israel and Syria in an 
effort to promote a peace treaty, met later today with Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres on his 
talks with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad.
