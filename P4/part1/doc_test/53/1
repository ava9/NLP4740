    [Editorial Report] Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew on 12 April, in 
a page 4 report by Moti Bassok on the Cairo talks, reports that 
"significant progress was made yesterday on a series of 
security, civilian, and military issues. Political sources in 
Jerusalem assessed yesterday that the agreement on the Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho will be signed by the end of 
the month. Two days after that, Israel will release 2,500 
Palestinian prisoners." 
  Basok reports that "a timetable for the Israeli withdrawal 
from Gaza and Jericho following the signing of the agreement was 
determined yesterday. Other things decided were a timetable for 
the release of Palestinian prisoners and the deployment dates 
for the Palestinian police force. Progress was also achieved on 
the issues of control of water resources, security in Gaza's 
naval zone, and control over the Gaza Strip and Jericho 
airspace. Most issues pertaining to judicial powers were also 
resolved." 
  Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 12 April on pages 1 
and 19 carries a report by No'omi Levitzky saying that "the 
substantial entry of Palestinian policemen to the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho will start in early May. The force will number 9,000 
policemen: 2,000 from the territories and 7,000 from abroad. 
The deployment of the policemen in Gaza and Jericho will be 
completed by the end of May. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
withdrawal will proceed at the same time and will be completed 
three weeks after the agreement is signed. 
  "The IDF withdrawal timetable at this stage looks as 
follows: 
During the first week after the agreement is signed, the IDF 
will withdraw from Rafah and Jericho. During the second week, 
it will pull out of Khan Yunus, and in the third week, it will 
leave Gaza and the northern part of the Strip. The body in 
charge of managing the autonomy will settle in Jericho during 
the first week after the agreement is signed."
