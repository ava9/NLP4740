    [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200 
GMT on 21 April reports that "the latest round of Israeli-PLO 
talks ended in Cairo a short while ago. The talks are slated to 
resume at the beginning of next week." Dr. Nabil Sha'th told 
correspondent Moti Amir that "several important understandings 
in the security and civil spheres were achieved this week," and 
that he expects that an agreement on the autonomy's legal powers 
will be achieved next week. 
  "Brigadier General Gadi Zohar, head of the Civilian Affairs 
Committee in the Cairo talks, estimated that the Civil 
Administration would be able to transfer powers in Gaza to the 
Palestinians a few days after the agreement is signed." 
  Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1500 GMT on 21 April, 
reporting on "progress" in the Cairo talks, says that "both 
sides were optimistic that an agreement could be wrapped up by 
next week's end. Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the 
Israeli delegation to the talks, said Israel could not meet the 
PLO's demand for a timetable for the release of all Palestinian 
prisoners before an agreement is signed. He described the 
week's negotiations as extremely fruitful." 
  PLO chief delegate, Nabil Sha'th, was also optimistic, and 
spoke to Qol Yisra'el's Moti Amir about the progress made in 
this week's talks, and his expectations for next week. He said 
the negotiations this week concluded "all the elements of the 
transfer of authority. So, all civilian authorities, or what's 
called civil authorities, including water, zoning, air 
transport, telecommunications, electricity, fuel and gas -- all 
of these issues were concluded during this week. We have been 
able to conclude also several remaining items of the security 
protocol or the security annex, but we remain with few of these 
issues, such as the modalities of joint patrols and crossing 
points, and the passage between Gaza and Jericho, and some 
elements that remain in the issue of visas and the renewal of 
visas. All of these will be, I hope, finished during next week. 
We have decided that next Monday we will be more ready to 
announce the exact date of the signing. We, in all 
probabilities and barring major disagreement or major events, we 
should be concluding everything during next week." Sha'th 
added: "We are going to do our best to conclude next week and 
sign the week after." 
  Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1505 GMT on 21 April 
cites a report by Moti Amir who points to the assessment that "a 
date will be set next week for the signing ceremony on the 
Gaza-Jericho accord which will take place in Cairo and will be 
attended by the prime minister, the PLO head, and President 
Mubarak, the main sponsor of the accord." Amir notes that "the 
conclusion of the negotiations on the Gaza-Jericho accord also 
depends on the negotiations on economic issues taking place in 
Paris." Also, besides the remaining dispute on the legal powers 
of the autonomy's authority, "the two sides are still divided on 
the Gaza Strip's fishing zones, the construction of a port 
there, and the stationing of Palestinian policemen at the border 
crossings in Jericho and Rafah. Handling of some of these 
questions will continue after the agreement is signed. 
  "Brig. Gen. Zohar, head of the Civilian Affairs Committee, 
emphasized that upon signing the agreement with the 
Palestinians, a body will be established to coordinate matters 
between the Palestinian authority and the Israeli authorities." 
Amir adds that "the final draft of the agreement on civilian 
issues will be formulated in Cairo next week, except those few 
issues both sides decided to pass on to the two leaders who will 
sign the Gaza-Jericho accord." 
  In an earlier talk with Moti Amir Maj. Gen. Shahaq stressed 
that about 5,000 prisoners would be released in stages, in 
accordance with criteria agreed upon by the sides. Still, "the 
release will not include Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
members, terrorists who murdered Jews, or terrorists who 
operated after the signing of the Declaration of Principles." 
Understandings will have to be achieved also regarding 
"Palestinians who are persecuted by their brethren for 
collaboration with Israel."
