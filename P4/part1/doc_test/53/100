from Gaza-Jericho is fraught with danger

Failure to achieve substantial progress at a summit yesterday between
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman,
will leave Palestinians and Israelis feeling even more insecure in a land
already rife with anxiety and violence.
Israel had been due today to begin dismantling the military apparatus which,
for more than two decades, has controlled the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
area of Jericho - captured during the 1967 Six Day War. It was unclear last
night whether Israel would proceed as planned with the symbolic gestures
designed to mark a historic, and probably irreversible, step towards
Palestinian national self-determination.
Both sides will have to face the consequences of delay. Even if a protocol
is agreed within the next 10 days, the way ahead is fraught with danger.
Public support for the peace process is at its lowest point since the
September signing; violence, mistrust and suspicion have replaced
enthusiasm. The PLO and the Israeli government will have to move fast to
ensure that extremists do not exploit the lingering vacuum.
For Palestinians that means an explicit demonstration by Israel that it is
really handing over substantial power to a Palestinian authority and easing
its military grip.
For Israelis it largely means the PLO taking up the responsibility of office
and using its embryonic police force to rein in attacks by Palestinians
against Jews and increase security, which remains the touchstone of Israeli
concern.
The tasks will not be easy but both Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat are badly in need
of a boost.
The most urgent need is to iron out the last remaining points of
disagreement on a protocol which lays the framework for a phased four-month
Israeli troop pull-out from Gaza-Jericho and the transfer of power from the
Israeli military-run civil administration to Palestinian hands.
Although Israel could begin a symbolic withdrawal today - dismantling
barricades, redeploying troops away from some Palestinian-populated areas
and releasing up to 1,500 Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners - the real
withdrawal cannot go ahead before the protocol is in place.
Three key issues remain to be resolved: the size of the Jericho area, the
role and number of Israeli troops who will stay behind to safeguard Jewish
settlers, and control over border crossings between Gaza and Egypt and
Jericho and Jordan.
Despite the pessimistic tone of yesterday's meeting both sides believe
agreement is within reach.
But once the protocol is signed there are likely to be tough times during
the months leading up to April 13, when Israeli military withdrawal must be
completed.
Detailed plans are in place for the transfer of power from Israeli to
Palestinian hands - that part of the peace talks went relatively smoothly.
However, implementation will be more difficult and will try the patience of
both Palestinians and Israelis.
Two critical concerns hang over the PLO. The first is whether the former
liberation movement is ready to assume administration of the economically
decimated, faction-riven Gaza Strip - home to 900,000 Palestinians. The top
leadership of the PLO is deeply split, with mounting criticism about the
authoritarian leadership of Mr Arafat and his preference for political
appointees of his own generation, rather than professionals, to staff
administrative bodies. Several key officials have resigned recently,
charging Mr Arafat with an inability to respond to the challenge of
governing or reforming the bureaucratic and centralised decision-making
system.
Secondly, there are deep doubts about Mr Arafat's willingness or ability to
move against Palestinian extremists both inside and outside the PLO. Will
he, for example, dispatch his police force to confiscate weapons from
Islamic guerrillas intent on launching attacks across the Gaza border into
Israel?
Even if Mr Arafat wishes to do so he may be constrained by the domestic
political situation and the prospect of elections next July (although to
many Palestinians that date already seems optimistic).
On the Israeli side the challenge of the next four months is equally
formidable.
Once the protocol is signed and Israeli withdrawal is in full flow Mr Rabin
will have to rely on the safeguards enshrined in the peace accord and on the
goodwill of the Palestinians.
How long will the prime minister, already under intense domestic pressure,
be able to hold out if Palestinian attacks do not subside? And can Mr Rabin,
hanging on to power with a wafer thin parliamentary majority and an almost
permanent coalition crisis, risk a showdown with increasingly militant
Jewish settlers? Without more concrete peace dividends - such as better
security, an end to the Arab boycott or peace with Jordan - the government
will face an uphill battle selling its peace policy to a sceptical public.
For both Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat the real challenge ahead is managing their
own constituencies. Both men will need each other's patience, goodwill and
courage to make the process succeed and defeat the extremists waiting in the
wings.
