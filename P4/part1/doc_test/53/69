  [Text] Amman--Jordanian banks which used to have branches 
in the occupied West Bank prior to 1967 will be allowed to 
reopen one branch each in the next two months, Information 
Minister Jawad al-'Anani said Sunday [9 January]. 
  Dr. al-'Anani, a Jordanian strategist in Middle East peace 
talks who played a key role in finalising an economic 
cooperation agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organisation 
on Friday, said opening of new banks would be considered after 
giving priority to those which had branches in the occupied West 
Bank on June 4, 1967--one day before the war started. 
  Eight Jordanian banks had 31 branches in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip when Israel occupied the territories. Those in the 
West Bank followed Jordanian laws. All banks in the Gaza Strip, 
including two branches of two Jordanian banks, were governed by 
Egyptian regulations. 
  Cairo-Amman Bank reopened in 1986 under a special 
arrangement, but it had to curtail its branches' activities 
mainly to money changing because of Israeli regulations. 
  Palestinians could not get loans from the bank for two 
reasons: first: the bank had to deposit 110 per cent of the 
loan amount with the bank of Israel and second, the Palestinians 
were reluctant to mortgage their land as collateral for fear of 
seizures by the bank and the eventuality that an Israeli might 
end up as the ultimate buyer of the land. 
  The accord finalised Friday after three days of talks sets 
out a broad framework for Jordanian-Palestinian cooperation. 
Among other things, it clears the way for Jordan to implement a 
memorandum of understanding it signed with Israel on Dec. 1 on 
reopening the bank branches. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said priority would also be given to banks 
applying to reopen branches in Jericho and the Gaza Strip in 
view of a request made by the Palestinian negotiators. 
  The West Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza Strip are 
expected 
to be transferred to limited Palestinian self-rule authority in 
line with the Sept. 13 autonomy agreement between Israel and the 
PLO. 
  The main base of the self-rule authority is expected to be 
located in Jericho. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said CBJ regulations would be applicable to 
banks in the West Bank as well as the Gaza Strip. The memo 
signed with Israel on Dec. 1 provides for reopening the branches 
in the West Bank and, as officials said later, Jordan had to 
work out a separate accord on the Gaza Strip. 
  Under the memo, the Bank of Israel will issue a token 
approval for the banks already licensed by the Central Bank of 
Jordan (CBJ). The obligations of the reopened branches to the 
Bank of Israel will be limited to sending a periodic report on 
their activities. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said the permission to reopen one branch each 
will be followed by permissions for others. But in the 
beginning, each of the banks will be allowed to open only one 
branch. 
  A joint Jordanian-Palestinian technical committee will work 
under the guidance of the CBJ in processing the reopening of the 
branches. 
  The joint panel will also set monetary policies aimed at 
protecting and maintaining the stability of the Jordanian dinar. 
  The seven branches that the Cairo-Amman Bank operates in the 
occupied territories now would also be brought under total CBJ 
control, after ending the 1986 arrangement, Dr. al-'Anani said. 
  Dr. al-'Anani noted that the economic agreement also 
provides 
for the use of other currencies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 
but that it excludes the Israeli shekel. 
  Israel said that the shekel would have to remain in 
circulation in the autonomous territory; palestinian officials 
say that it would be impossible to eliminate the shekel 
altogether from the occupied lands during the interim period, 
particularly that tens of thousands of Palestinians would 
continue to be employed in Israel and be paid in the Israeli 
currency. 
  Israeli officials have suggested that the Palestinians could 
issue a currency similar to the Scotish pound. Although issued 
by Scotland as a sign of Scotish identity, the currency remains 
under the control of the bank of England. 
  The Egyptian pound, which was in force in the Gaza Strip 
until Israel seized the costal strip from Egypt in the 1967 war, 
will be among the currencies in circulation. 
  The pound is sparingly used in the Gaza Strip now. According 
to reports, only Gazans wishing to travel to Egypt across the 
Rafah border buys Egyptian pounds for use in Egyptian territory. 
  According to PLO sources, the use of Egyptian pounds in the 
autonomous territories is part of commitments that PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat has made to Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, with 
whom he has stepped up coordination. 
  Mr. 'Arafat, who seems to have abandoned for the moment the 
idea of issuing a Palestinian currency during the interim 
period, also reportedly sees the use of more than one Arab 
currency in the autonomous territory as a symbol of Palestinian 
links with the Arabs while asserting Palestinian independence.
