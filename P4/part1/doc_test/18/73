IRAQ NEGOTIATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baker and others explain that their disagreement with former high military and 
government officials about the Iraqi situation is due to those former 
officials' lack of current detailed knowledge which he and a few other 
Administration officials possess. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest a straightforward way for the Administration to test this idea -- and 
convince many doubting citizens that our present course is the correct one. 
</P>
<P>
Let Baker, (Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman) Colin Powell, (Secretary of 
Defense) Dick Cheney and (national security adviser) Brent Scowcroft meet 
privately with these former officials and bring them up to date on the latest 
information. Then the now well-informed dissenters can again go before the 
congressional committees and correct their previous statements.
