Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Sunday that 
the armed forces offer black Americans equal opportunity with whites "more so 
than any other form of endeavor in our society." 
</P>
<P>
Powell, the first black to hold the nation's highest uniformed rank, also said 
he does not believe that the all-volunteer U.S. forces have become 
disproportionately black. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's out of proportion," he said, adding that "anybody who is 
willing to serve, qualified to serve, proud to serve should be allowed to 
serve." 
</P>
<P>
Blacks currently make up about 21% of the armed forces; about 12% of the U.S. 
population is black. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley," Powell was 
asked whether he considers the military system a "meritocracy" and whether it 
is an equal-opportunity employer. 
</P>
<P>
Powell replied: "More so than any other form of endeavor in our society. I'm 
very proud of what we have done in the military over the years and I think, for 
the most part, it is a meritocracy. You are not limited by anything but your 
own ability."
