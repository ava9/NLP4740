U.S. SELF-INTEREST AND OIL CRISIS IN PERSIAN GULF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a 55-year-old African-American who served four years in the U.S. Navy, I 
find the commentary "Colorblind at the Front Lines," by Charles E. McGee, 
astonishing (Platform, Aug. 14). 
</P>
<P>
Where is he coming from when he asks an African-American to be colorblind. 
</P>
<P>
America has never had to worry about African-Americans giving 100% effort in 
any war, and it doesn't now. 
</P>
<P>
I hope he is concerned enough and is doing something about the continued racism 
in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Also, if he thinks Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
has gotten where he is without the decision makers considering his color, he's 
a bigger fool than Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
So, don't worry, Mr. McGee; your black brothers and sisters will follow orders 
as if God were the one who ordered them; and you can go back to your 
second-class living.
