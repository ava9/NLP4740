Reagan and Marilyn: Did Ronald Reagan help launch Marilyn Monroe's career? Yes, 
claims Norma Jean Enterprises in Toronto. A spokesman for the company said 
Reagan was a captain in the Army's motion picture unit in World War II when he 
ordered David Conover to take morale-boosting photos of women.

Conover found the young Monroe (then known as Norma Jean Dougherty) working at 
a defense plant in El Segundo and made the photographs that first caught 
Hollywood's eye.

War and Remembrance: When Gen. Colin L. Powell agreed to be honorary grand 
marshal for the King Week parade Jan. 21, he didn't know he would raise a 
ruckus in the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s hometown. Civil rights leader the 
Rev. Joseph Lowery said in Atlanta that Powell's role would conflict with 
King's teachings of nonviolence. King declared the U.S. government to be "the 
greatest purveyor of violence in the world" and vehemently opposed the Vietnam 
War, in which Powell served two tours of duty. Powell, chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, often quotes the slain civil rights leader in his speeches.

Prison Growth: Evangelist Jim Bakker is doing fine behind bars. Basil Jackson, 
who treated Bakker after his mental collapse during his trial, says he recently 
visited Bakker at the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minn., where Bakker 
is serving a 45-year sentence for defrauding his followers. "His faith is 
stronger now than it ever was," Jackson said. But his comment did not apply to 
the courts: "Naturally, he has questions about the system of justice."
