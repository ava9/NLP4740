THE THREAT of immediate military action against Iraq receded last night as
the US announced further movement of Iraqi aircraft and missiles away from
the exclusion zone in the country's south.
Reports from the White House and the Pentagon came as the 48-hour ultimatum
issued by the US, Britain and France to Iraq to withdraw its missiles
expired. Earlier, Iraq had insisted it had no intention of backing down and
that the deployment of air defences was a sovereign matter. Mr Tariq Aziz,
the deputy prime minister, said that if attacked Iraq would respond in kind.
US officials were careful to state that it was still impossible to determine
if Iraq was in compliance with the terms of the ultimatum. But they said
Iraqi aircraft had been flown out of one base close to the no-fly zone while
missile batteries were no longer deployed in a 'potentially hostile
pattern.'
General Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, noted 'lots of
movement' of missiles, but did not reveal their new whereabouts, possibly
because heavy cloud cover in the region has made aerial reconnaissance
difficult. He also implied any action in Iraq would not be immediately
taken.
'There has been a good deal of movement involving these missiles but we are
still in the process of determining whether Iraq is in compliance with the
terms of the coalition demarche (demand),' White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said in a statement just before the 5.30 pm Washington time (22.30
GMT) deadline. 'We continue to keep the situation in Iraq under close
scrutiny.'
President George Bush had conferred earlier with his national security
advisers, including General Powell, and been briefed at the CIA.
President-elect Bill Clinton again reaffirmed his support for Mr Bush's
stance, saying there was 'no daylight' between their views.
Military experts had considered the most likely targets for any 'surgical'
allied strike would be fixed military installations such as air bases,
communications centres and missile sites. These would probably include
targets north of the 32nd parallel.
The apparent Iraqi withdrawals came after the United Nations had been told
by Baghdad that none of its aircraft, including those carrying teams of
inspectors searching for weapons of mass destruction, could land. A UN team
was due to leave Bahrain for Bagh-dad this weekend. The Iraqi news agency
said the cabinet had applauded the decision by the country's political
leadership 'to confront the new, blatant American aggression which is doomed
to failure thanks to the unity and steadfastness of our people and armed
forces under our blessed leader Saddam Hussein'.
Iraq was thought to have deployed between three and five batteries of
Soviet-made SA-2 and SA-3 anti-aircraft missiles in the east of the no-fly
zone.
At first the movement of these missiles was consistent with standard
practice and was not necessarily a response to the ultimatum. The missile
systems can be dismantled, transported to another prepared site and
re-assembled within a matter of hours.
But later the US appeared to conclude they had been moved to non-aggressive
positions.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said it was clear Mr Saddam had
to remove the missiles and to stop infringing the no-fly zone.
An Iraqi Mig-25 aircraft was shot down by a US fighter on December 27 over
the exclusion zone and soon afterwards it was reported that the batteries of
Iraqi Sam-2 and Sam-3 missiles had been moved south of the 32nd parallel.
The no-fly zone was imposed at the end of August to protect the Shia
population against further attacks by forces loyal to Saddam Hussein.
US, British and French aircraft were moved to Saudi Arabia to supplement the
American carrier-based forces operating in the Gulf.
Allied strength now amounts to more than 200 combat aircraft, supported by
airborne radar systems and electronic jamming equipment.
