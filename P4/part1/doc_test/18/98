GENERAL Colin Powell, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
yesterday American forces would pursue those responsible for the deaths of
four US soldiers in Mogadishu over the weekend, Reuter reports from
Washington.
'Obviously we are interested in going after any of those responsible for the
incident if we can find out who they are,' Gen Powell told reporters.
On Sunday President Bill Clinton vowed to take 'appropriate action' after
Somali gunmen ambushed a UN peacekeepers' convoy and killed four Americans -
the heaviest loss of US life since American troops landed in Somalia in
December.
A faction loyal to fugitive warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed, blamed by UN
special envoy Jonthan Howe for recent 'terrorist attacks', has denied
responsibility for the US deaths. Gen Powell said he had no announcement of
any new US policy in Somalia but said security would be tightened by US
forces. About 4,000 US troops remain in Somalia, down from about 22,000
earlier this year.
