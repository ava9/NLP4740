  [Text] Staff Lieutenant General 'Abd-al-Hafiz 
al-Ka'abinah, Jordanian chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
who is currently visiting Turkey as the guest of Gen. Dogan 
Gures, chief of the General Staff, is meeting with officials in 
Ankara. 
  Al-Ka'abinah first called on Gures today. He was received 
with a military ceremony upon his arrival at the Chief of the 
General Staff's Office. The two chiefs of staff conferred for 
some time. 
  The Jordanian chief of staff later visited National Defense 
Minister Mehmet Golhan. During the meeting, Golhan recalled 
that Jordan and Turkey are situated in the vicinity of war, 
adding that the two countries can contribute to world peace 
through joint efforts. Al-Ka'abinah, in turn, noted that the 
existing process of friendship between the two countries will be 
further strengthened in the future. 
  The Jordanian chief of staff was then presented with an 
order 
of merit for his contributions to Jordanian-Turkish military 
cooperation. Addressing the ceremony on the occasion, Gures 
remarked that the Jordanian chief of staff's efforts for the 
development of bilateral relations will never be forgotten. 
Golhan also attended the ceremony.
