Beijing"] 
  [Text] Beijing, March 30 (YONHAP) -- An envoy's comments 
touched a raw nerve with the [ROK] president and his aides 
Tuesday, just when they thought they had finished the 
tension-packed duties of their visits to Japan and china. 
  South Korean Ambassador to Beijing Hwang Pyong-tae, a former 
lawmaker, apparently made two big mistakes -- he disclosed the 
contents of the Korea-China [summit] talks, and what he chose to 
reveal ran counter to what the president said. 
  President Kim Yong-sam refused to answer questions on the 
specifics of his talks with Chinese Premier Li Peng at a press 
conference Tuesday, saying only that his visits to Tokyo and 
Beijing had helped form a trilateral cooperation channel among 
the United States, Japan and China. 
  He said he hoped to include Russia in this chain to bring 
aboard all four regional powers in solving the North Korean 
nuclear problem. 
  Then came Ambassador Hwang, who arranged an evening press 
conference at the request of South Korean TV journalists. He 
suggested that while South Korean-U.S. coordination supplied the 
impetus for dealing with the nuclear question, it would be South 
Korean-Chinese coordination from now on. 
  "The discussion on the North Korean nuclear issue between 
South Korea and China has outgrown the past practice, where 
South Korea and the United States would only notify the results 
of their consultations (to others), changing to where South 
Korea and China would hold deep discussions from the beginning 
and take joint steps," the ambassador told the press. 
  Asked about Japan and Russia's role, he said Seoul would 
simply brief Moscow on the results of the negotiations, and 
"it's realistically difficult to expect Japan to play a role." 
  He went on to disclose the details of the Kim-Li meeting. 
"Premier Li Peng told President Kim that China would continue to 
try to solve the nuclear problem through dialogue if North Korea 
has no nuclear weapons. But if North Korea does have nuclear 
weapons, China would counter it ever strongly," he said. 
  The envoy then predicted that North Korea would soon resume 
negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
on additional inspections. 
  The news later reached Senior Secretary for Diplomacy Chong 
Chong-uk and Spokesman Chu Ton-sik, who belatedly tried to cork 
the story. 
  Chung, Chu, and Hwang came by the press center twice around 
midnight, saying the facts had been misrepresented and pleading 
that sensitive parts of the story not be published. 
  A close presidential aide insisted that Hwang's remarks do 
not reflect the Seoul government's official position: Nor is it 
true that the South Korea-China channel has reached the same 
level as negotiations between Seoul and Washington. 
  "All it means is that the channel with China was strengthend 
through the Beijing visit," the aide said. "It's also not true 
that North Korea will resume talks with the IAEA soon." 
  President Kim personally refuted Hwang's remarks in a 
breakfast meeting with the press Wednesday, emphasizing South 
Korea's affinity to the United States, its close cooperation 
with allies and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's "hasty" trip to 
Washington. 
  One official at the presidential office [Chongwadae] openly 
criticized the envoy, saying, "I don't know whether Ambassador 
Hwang is a diplomat or still a politician."
