  [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's 
office may strengthen the government's overall policy 
coordination as senior administration officials continue to 
contradict one another on the North Korean nuclear dispute and 
other foreign and national security issues. As part of the plan 
reported Monday, the presidential office would either form a 
consultative body comprising Chongwadae, the National 
Unification Board, the foreign and defense ministries and the 
Agency for National Security Planning, or beef up Chongwadae's 
team on foreign and national security affairs. 
  One Chongwadae official acknowledged Monday that confusion 
has emerged in the government's foreign and security policy 
"because of Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's attitude, Ambassador 
to China Hwang Pyong-tae's recent remarks and Vice Foreign 
Minister Hong Sun-yong's publicly expressed opinion" over the 
weekend. 
  "Chongwadae is undertaking a study from various angles in 
order to strengthen the coordinating function of its foreign and 
security policy," the official said, requesting anonymity. 
  The consultative body is being considered because of the 
limitations of the current system including conferences of 
security-related ministers, chaired by the president, and the 
prime minister's strategic sessions with high government 
officials. But the new body would not be like the United 
States' National Security Council (NSC) since the present 
security-related ministers' meetings perform a similar function, 
he said. 
  Alternatively, Chongwadae may beef up the office of the 
senior presidential secretary for foreign and national security 
affairs since it is the president who makes the final decision 
on all foreign and security policy, he said. 
  Another Chongwadae official said, "following Ambassador 
Hwang's inappropriate remarks, our foreign policy was once again 
plunged into confusion when Vice Foreign Minister Hong suggested 
on Sunday that the government should consider dropping its 
demand for a special envoy exchange with North Korea as a 
precondition for a third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level 
talks." 
  "It has become an urgent government task to strengthen 
policy 
coordination if we are to establish an effective North Korea 
strategy," the official said. 
  "The weakest point in our foreign policy in the past started 
with showing all our cards," the official pointed out. 
Henceforth, the government will keep secret its negotiating 
strategy while beefing up the publicity function, he said.
