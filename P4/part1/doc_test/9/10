  [Text] Russian-Japanese relations are so far lacking in 
"genuine" trust, Interfax was told Thursday by the new Deputy 
Russian Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov, who will be in charge 
of relations with Japan and the countries of Asia and the 
Pacific instead of Georgiy Kunadze, who is now Russian 
Ambassador in Seoul. 
  Panov, who was until recently the Russian Ambassador in 
South 
Korea and for whom the present post was somewhat a surprise, 
sees his main task in promoting confidence in the relationships 
between Russia and Japan. 
  Panov has said that relations with Japan are a key priority 
of the Russian foreign policy determined by Russian President 
Yeltsin. 
  During his last year's visit to Tokyo the two sides fixed 
the 
top priorities of Russian foreign policies towards Tokyo. I do 
not see what is to be changed so much to deviate radically from 
our course, said the diplomat. 
  Speaking about the territorial problem in the Russian- 
Japanese relations, Panov has said that everyone in Russia seems 
to know about its existence. The problem does exist but joint 
forces are needed to search and find the way out, he said.
