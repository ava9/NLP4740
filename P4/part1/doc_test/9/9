"Ambassadorial Rumors" rubric: "How Diplomats Are Packaged"] 
  [Text] The resignation request from Russian First Deputy 
Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin was submitted to President 
Yeltsin even before the New Year holiday. The reason for this 
was his election to the State Duma as a representative of the 
Yabloko bloc. 
  And he will be replaced as deputy minister by the current 
Russian ambassador to Spain, Igor Ivanov. He is well-known in 
the Foreign Ministry, as he headed that department's general 
secretariat for a long time. 
  An additional two ambassadors will occupy offices in the 
skyscraper on Smolensk Square. They are Aleksandr Panov, 
ambassador to South Korea; and Albert Chernyshev, who has 
represented Russia in Turkey for six years now. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry has made it known that all 
these 
reshuffles are of planned nature and are in line with the 
principle of staff rotation. They do not hide their 
satisfaction there that leading posts will be occupied by career 
diplomats. 
  The fate of the ambassador in London, Boris Pankin, will 
probably be different. For the time being he remains there, but 
the decision to replace him was made long ago. 
  According to our information, the Tetrapak company, which 
intends to pool its efforts in the near future with the French 
company, Alfa-Laval, on learning that Boris Pankin was about to 
leave his post, immediately offered him a job as a consultant in 
"any country" of his choice. He has supposedly opted for 
Sweden, where, we remind you, he was once ambassador. Tetrapak 
produces packaging, including cartons for milk. 
  Some are moving into commerce, others returning to big-time 
politics. When we rang Washington, [Ambassador] Vladimir 
Petrovich Lukin was upbeat. In masterly fashion he parried our 
probing question, "Is it true that you are down to be deputy 
speaker?" "I am ready for anything? Let's see when we get 
there. Incidentally, the job is not that attractive, it's pure 
anxiety and turmoil, particularly if they decide to turn the 
speaker into a lightning rod." Vladimir Petrovich said. "I 
don't envy the speaker--he will have a tough job." 
  While observing that he knew several suitable people who 
could occupy the vacant ambassadorial posts, Lukin was reluctant 
to give their names so as to avoid, as we understood it, 
inadvertently doing them an ill turn. On the other hand, he 
gladly told us about the attributes which they, according to the 
diplomat, should possess. In Washington he would like to see 
someone with considerable experience and knowledge of both the 
language and the country. 
  The Washington Embassy throughtout has been a source of 
alternative information for the president, the government, and 
the Foreign Ministry. A valuable quality for those who know how 
to avoid being in thrall to "convenient" assessments.
