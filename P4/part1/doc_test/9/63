  [Text] Seoul, April 30 (YONHAP) -- A sense of stability 
returned to the presidential office Saturday when the country's 
national security and foreign affairs team was finally made 
complete with the appointment of a new prime minister and deputy 
premier-unification minister. 
  Reflecting this feeling, President Kim sat down with his two 
new ministers after formally appointing them to their posts. 
  "I knew I would have the chance to work with Vice Prime 
Minister Yi some day," the president was quoted as saying to his 
Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku. 
  "That time has come," Kim said. 
  New Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok joked that the position of 
vice premier-unification minister is "not easy." 
  Yi Hong-ku, on the other hand, had soccer on his mind. He 
worried openly that his change of jobs might jeopardize Seoul's 
chances of winning the right to host the 2002 World Cup soccer 
finals. 
  "Personal relationships decide the successful bid for 
becoming host. I am concerned because the chance of winning the 
bid is getting higher now," Yi said. 
  -- The opposition Democratic Party welcomed Yi Hong-ku's 
appointment but withheld a statement because of its 
confrontation with the ruling party in the process of approving 
the prime minister. 
  "We make a statement by not making a statement instead," 
party spokesman Pak Chae-won said. "But I personally think it 
was a good choice." 
  The Supreme Council's Kim Won-ki called the new unification 
minister a man "of experience and learning" while Rep. Mun 
Hi-sang described him as an expert on unification affairs, 
suited to leading Seoul's North Korea policy in the right 
direction. 
  The ruling Democratic Liberal Party loudly welcomed Yi's 
appointment as unification minister, calling it "appropriate" 
and Yi "the right person." 
  Rep. Yi Se-ki, chairman of the Party Policy Committee, 
reminded that Yi was excellent as a college professor, highly 
valued during his days as unification minister and effective as 
ambassador to Britain. 
  He saw Yi as moderate and possessed of a long-range vision 
in 
North Korea policies and predicted smooth sailing in cooperation 
with the party. 
  Secretary-General Yi Han-tong praised the deputy premier as 
a 
man of "goodwill and benevolence." 
  The ruling camp had another reason to be happy -- the fact 
that the cabinet shake-up was much smaller in scale than feared. 
  Speculation once abounded that President Kim would change 
his 
diplomatic policy team and shake up the party leadership. "Now 
it's been proven that there was no need to reshuffle the party," 
one official said with relief.
