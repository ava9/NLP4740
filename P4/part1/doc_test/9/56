  [Text] Jakarta, May 23 (YONHAP) -- The diplomatic 
importance of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) to South Korea was 
driven home during Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's visit here 
this week, especially with the North Korean nuclear controvery 
looming in the background. 
  Han came to Jakarta eight days before a meeting of NAM 
foreign ministers, held every three years, in Cairo where the 
North Korean nuclear issue, in connection with an overall review 
of the situation on the Korean peninsula, will be addressed for 
the first time. 
  "It's important that we make clear where we stand on the 
North Korean nuclear problem, that NAM take our position into 
account when the foreign ministers' meeting convenes," said Yu 
Pyong-u, director-general of the Asian Affairs Bureau at the 
South Korean Foreign Ministry. 
  The foreign ministers are expected to adopt a final document 
through consensus and the wording of the clause on the nuclear 
impasse, if it in any way leans toward South Korea, will have no 
small impact considering Pyongyang's ties with NAM. 
  North Korea keeps its third largest embassy in Jakarta with 
a 
25-member staff. Current Ambassador Ham Pong-ha has been here 
for four years. Diplomatic officials say the embassy functions 
as a base camp for North Korea's diplomatic lobbying activities 
in Southeast Asia as well as Australia and New Zealand. 
  Indonesia, as the chair of NAM, could serve as South Korea's 
window to the group by reflecting its position without Seoul 
actually being there, bringing the movement more toward the 
center between the two Koreas. 
  It is hoped that Han's visit will add force to Seoul's 
efforts to achieve this objective. 
  Indonesia's stance on the nuclear issue was too ambivalent 
from Seoul's point of view as late as last January, when Jakarta 
kept visibly silent as the UN Security Council adopted a 
resolution urging Pyongyang to comply with International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections. 
  South Korea felt compelled to step up its persuasion of 
Indonesia, hoping in turn to reach NAM. 
  Then in March, President Suharto sent one of his ambassadors 
to North Korea as a special envoy. The following month, North 
Korea sent Vice Foreign Minister Kim Chang-kyu to Jakarta. 
  This activity produced a letter from President Suharto, 
speaking as NAM chairman, to UN Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali saying the group wanted to see the problem solved 
through dialogue, but that North Korea should accept IAEA 
inspections and remain within the nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty (NPT) regime. 
  Seoul officials say this stance was the product of much 
convincing by South Korea and international organizations. The 
global consensus obviously helped as the issue has been recycled 
through IAEA, United Nations and Security Council statements and 
resolutions, they say. 
  South Korea's ties with NAM will receive a more potent boost 
when President Kim Yong-sam comes here for the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November. The Seoul 
government expects a Kim-Suharto summit during the APEC 
conference. 
  The presidents will likely go over again, at the highest 
level, where they stand on the nuclear controversy while 
strengthening their two-way relationship.
