AROUND THE VALLEY: THE POSSIBILITY OF DEATH IS NEVER FAR FROM THE MIND OF A 
CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY WORKER.

Asign is posted prominently inside the musty shed at the Caltrans yard in 
Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
"Please Don't Smoke," it reads, taking up the oft-heard anti-smoking cry of 
modern American life, "We'd rather die of natural causes." 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of death is never far from the mind of a California highway 
worker these days. Forty-five have been killed since 1972, 24 by errant 
motorists, making their job more potentially lethal than that of California 
Highway Patrol officers, 40 of whom have been killed in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Last Dec. 12, 36-year-old Henry Mendoza, who had worked in the Newhall office, 
was killed while setting up highway cones between the Glendale and Foothill 
freeways in Glendale. A car drove through the cones and hit a Caltrans trailer, 
which hit Mendoza. More than 150 of Mendoza's colleagues, dressed in their 
distinctive orange vests, attended the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a good worker," recalled Roger Moody, a Newhall supervisor and 
Mendoza's close friend. But Mendoza, in his opinion, made a mistake by going to 
work setting out the cones before the heavy equipment arrived, which would have 
been parked in front of the workers to protect them. "They didn't wait for 
backup," Moody said. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning, Moody and his 10-man crew were confronting a job that 
would have been rough, grueling work on a normal construction site: replacing a 
10-foot-square, 10-inch-thick slab of concrete that looked like it could hold 
back the Colorado River. But this slab was lying in the right-hand lane of 
Interstate 5, a wide expanse of highway amid open canyons that encourages 
reckless speed. 
</P>
<P>
Moody, mustachioed, 50 years old and regarded by colleagues as "hard but fair," 
had been watching cracks grow in the slab for months. Now, as the big 
semitrailers roared deafeningly by, accelerating as they descended Weldon Grade 
west of Newhall, the slab vibrated like a tuning fork. 
</P>
<P>
Each "closure" is different, but this job was particularly dangerous because 
Moody had decided to close two of the lanes. Additionally, since the highway at 
this point began to twist around a curve in the canyon, the work site on the 
right was not easily visible from a distance. 
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing safety, Moody ordered workers to begin setting up the bright orange 
warning cones a quarter of a mile behind the work site, on the other side of 
the hill. Electronic message boards warning drivers to move over were moved 
into position and dump trucks and other heavy equipment were parked in front of 
the workers. Moody was making sure that if a car burst through the cones, as 
had occurred in Mendoza's case, they would have to smash their way through tons 
of metal to get to his men. 
</P>
<P>
But even when all this was done, there were problems. Cars and trucks could be 
heard slamming on their brakes and locking up their tires up the road from the 
workers. "Nobody wants to give way," Moody groused. 
</P>
<P>
The sounds of highway alarm caused Eric Foster to glance up anxiously. He knew 
how fast trouble could find a person. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, on U.S. 101 near Studio City, a car had driven through the 
cones, clipped the heavy Caltrans equipment and spun out of control. It hurtled 
past, within three feet of where Foster was standing. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing I could do, it happened so fast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, a 29-year-old North Hollywood man who wears rakish sunglasses and a 
blond beard, doesn't look like the kind of person who would scare easily, yet 
he was shaken. The driver was embarrassed. "He was afraid to come over" after 
the accident, Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
But a few miscreants regard highway workers as colorful targets. Objects have 
been thrown at Foster and once he was shot at. The bullet missed. 
</P>
<P>
"You do wonder if there's a better job somewhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moody was so frustrated by the failure of the cars and trucks to heed the 
warnings to move over that he took a chance and walked over to where the 
traffic rushed by like a turbulent river. Using his arms as though he were a 
kind of street mime pretending to throw some heavy object into the line of 
traffic, he began waving the cars over by hand. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he weren't being reckless, Moody said later, "I had to be where they 
could see me. I was ready to run." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he decided the closure was as safe as he could make it, and the work 
began in earnest. A man borrowed from the Lebec Caltrans office ran the 
"hoe-ram," a piece of equipment with a drill attached to the front for boring 
through the thick cement. 
</P>
<P>
After the slab was broken, Foster climbed into a loader and tried to scoop out 
the rest. Workers with thick steel pikes attacked boulder-sized pieces of 
cement that refused to budge. 
</P>
<P>
The loader finally burrowed its way through the concrete and revealed the cause 
of the slab failure: small pools of water. A drainage system was installed when 
the lane was built back in the '70s, Moody said. It had apparently failed, 
however, allowing water to build up and cause dirt under the slab to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the piercing wail of a semi's horn snapped everyone to attention. A 
big truck bore down on the rear bumper of a car that had waited until the last 
moment before moving to the left. The man in the car hunched over the wheel as 
though he were closing in on the checkered flag at Indianapolis. The crew 
watched in fascination as the two vehicles sped by in a perilous pas de deux, 
yet miraculously avoided an accident. 
</P>
<P>
Foster said his wife still worries that he might be killed on the job. But he 
said the $29,000 he makes each year "puts food on the table." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he shrugged, "the insurance is good."
