More Caltrans road maintenance workers have been killed on the state's highways 
in recent years than members of the California Highway Patrol. So robots are 
being developed to replace the endangered workers -- and also make it possible 
to do more work at night, keeping freeway lanes open during the day. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1972, 45 orange-clad California Department of Transportation workers have 
been killed and hundreds more injured by what the agency refers to as "errant 
motorists" -- drunken drivers barreling down the freeway at 75 m.p.h. or truck 
drivers, occasionally high on drugs, who cannot stop their rigs before they 
smash into a repair crew. 
</P>
<P>
In that same time period, 42 CHP members have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's dangerous out there," said Bob Ramey, deputy director for construction 
and maintenance in District 7, covering Los Angeles and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
To try to reduce this carnage, Caltrans has embarked on a research program to 
develop robotic machines that not only will take maintenance workers off the 
roads but also allow repairs to be done in less time, thereby helping with the 
congestion problems that are becoming increasingly critical in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
The UC Davis campus has a three-year, $1.2-million Caltrans contract to develop 
automatic devices that will seal freeway cracks, paint road stripes, replace 
pavement markers and pick up litter. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, there may also be machines to patch potholes and repair crash 
barriers. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to automate the entire maintenance operation," said Andrew A. Frank, 
professor of mechanical engineering at UC Davis and head of the "maintenance 
robotics" program. "We want to get workers off the road because the work is 
dangerous and we want to speed up the process. We think most of these jobs can 
be done five to 10 times faster than they are now." 
</P>
<P>
The first project undertaken by Frank and his group of half a dozen faculty 
members and 20 or so graduate and undergraduate students is a robotic device to 
replace pavement markers. 
</P>
<P>
These markers, some reflecting and others non-reflecting "rumble markers," are 
placed every 48 feet on freeways and highways. On little-used roads, they can 
last for years, but on a heavily traveled road such as the Long Beach Freeway, 
they can wear out in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The present method involves a two-man crew, with one driving the vehicle and 
the other wedged into a small compartment at tire level. While the vehicle 
rumbles along, the Caltrans worker in the lower compartment squirts epoxy on 
the markers and smacks them down on the lane. If all goes well, the team can 
replace about 200 markers in an hour. 
</P>
<P>
In the system under development at UC Davis, glue is squirted onto the roadway 
by a worker riding in a bucket seat, then markers automatically slide down a 
chute and are tamped into place. This machine, which Caltrans expects to have 
in service within a year, can replace 600 to 800 markers an hour. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Industry Involvement 
</P>
<P>
UC Davis researchers will do much of the work on the marker replacement device 
but Frank expects other universities and especially private industry to develop 
some of the other machines, under general supervision of the Davis campus. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that not much can be done with the $1.2 million the state is 
providing and that "cost sharing by private industry will be necessary" if 
these projects are to come to fruition. 
</P>
<P>
"We will monitor the projects," Frank said, "but our objective is to stimulate 
industry because they're the ones who are going to benefit -- they can sell 
these things to the entire world." 
</P>
<P>
Among the other automatic devices that Frank and his Davis colleagues hope to 
develop are: 
</P>
<P>
* A device that can clear large debris from the roadway while moving at speeds 
of up to 30 m.p.h. Currently, lanes are closed while workers on foot clear dead 
animals, wayward tires, garbage cans and homicide victims from the freeways and 
the bushes alongside. 
</P>
<P>
"We do run across dead bodies or parts of bodies," Ramey said. "I suppose 
that's the most disagreeable part of clean-up work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Handy Escape Routes' 
</P>
<P>
Ramey explained that local police and the CHP take care of accident victims but 
"I'm talking about homicides -- people get killed and dumped along the freeway, 
you know. Freeways are handy escape routes for criminals. . . . Mostly, they 
knock 'em off and roll 'em down the bank and we find 'em in the brush." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans already has an automated "litter gitter," with 6-foot robotic arms, 
that can pick up medium-sized debris, but it is slow. The new contraption will 
be faster and will be able to pick up larger objects. 
</P>
<P>
* A machine that will seal freeway and roadway cracks, a job now done by a 
Caltrans worker walking along with a kettle filled with crack sealer. In the 
new device, electronic sensors detect cracks; then valves open automatically to 
seal them. Caltrans officials expect to have such a machine in service in about 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
* A device that will detect faded road markings and automatically repaint them. 
Presently, Caltrans employs a dozen paint stripers statewide but hopes to 
replace them with machines in about three years. 
</P>
<P>
Frank also hopes that pothole filling, crash barrier repair and other 
maintenance jobs eventually can be transferred from men to machines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Much Pizazz 
</P>
<P>
In the past, he added, "the maintenance area is something that's been 
completely ignored by researchers, I guess because it doesn't have very much 
pizazz." 
</P>
<P>
But the growing problem of traffic congestion, combined with the rapid 
development of electronic sensors and small computers that can be placed aboard 
vehicles, make this kind of research more attractive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If Caltrans is to succeed in its goal of doubling road capacity and reducing 
accidents by 50% in the next few years, better and faster maintenance will play 
a crucial role. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to increase capacity, we're going to have less time for 
maintenance," said Robert E. Parsons, director of the UC Program on Advanced 
Technology on the Highway (PATH). "That means we've got to have a maintenance 
program to get workers off the road and do things faster."
