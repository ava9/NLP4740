An overturned crane closed eastbound lanes of the Ventura Freeway this morning, 
trapping commuters in gridlocked traffic and sending thousands of cars flooding 
onto surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
The operator of the crane suffered minor cuts and bruises in the 4:50 a.m. 
accident, which occurred as the crane was moving a five-ton concrete barrier 
into place at the interchange with the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
No one else was injured, but thousands of morning commuters found themselves in 
a virtual parking lot as eastbound traffic was backed up to Tampa Avenue, more 
than five miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic on the San Diego Freeway was also slowed by the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mess," Los Angeles police Officer Clarence Dean said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Normal traffic flow was restored about 9 a.m., California Highway Patrol 
Officer Jayne Suits said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jim McAllister, Caltrans' resident engineer for the ongoing 
Ventura Freeway Improvement Project, crews were replacing guardrails on the 
interchange. One eastbound lane of the Ventura Freeway and several transition 
roads were already closed for the work between midnight and 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the accident, the crane was replacing 20-foot temporary concrete 
barriers. Crews had already replaced 15 to 20 of the barriers and were 
scheduled to reopen the freeway lanes and transition roads as soon as the final 
barrier was in place. 
</P>
<P>
McAllister said the crane, which was in a closed fast lane, tipped and rolled 
onto its side. Weighed down by the concrete barrier, the arm of the crane fell 
onto the transition road from the southbound San Diego Freeway to the eastbound 
Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
All eastbound lanes of the Ventura Freeway were closed between 8:25 a.m. and 
8:40 a.m. as crews righted the crane and moved it out of traffic lanes. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid congestion on both freeways, thousands of commuters spilled onto 
surface streets.
