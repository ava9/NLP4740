DAY HIKE: FITNESS ON ROAD TO BLISS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The ascent of Mt. Bliss constitutes what hikers call a "conditioning hike," 
that is, a real aerobic workout. The incline is steep, the cardiovascular 
system gets revved up, and the clear-day views from the summit of this San 
Gabriel Mountains peak are truly rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
The route to Bliss utilizes both Van Tassel Fire Road and Van Tassel Trail. The 
fire road -- and others in the front range of the San Gabriels -- came into 
existence after the monstrous fire of September, 1924, the worst fire in the 
history of the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The fire began in San Gabriel Canyon and rapidly spread westward. Despite the 
efforts of firefighters, the blaze burned for three weeks and for a time 
threatened Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
As Rush Charleton, superintendent of Angeles National Forest at the time, put 
it: "The greatest difficulty in fighting the fire was the lack of roads over 
which to transport supplies to the men." 
</P>
<P>
Determined to prevent the occurrence of another fire of this size, the Forest 
Service began an ambitious program to build roads and firebreaks throughout the 
San Gabriels. One of these roads was the Van Tassel Fire Road. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Van Tassel Fire Road is patrolled by both the Los Angeles County 
Fire Department and Angeles National Forest personnel. Only official vehicles 
are allowed, but hikers and mountain bicyclists are welcome to travel the road. 
</P>
<P>
The new Van Tassel Trail, a footpath that leads from Valley View Park on the 
outskirts of the town of Duarte to an intersection with Van Tassel Road, also 
came into existence thanks to the efforts of firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Ross Marshall of the Los Angeles County Fire Department supervised a 
hard-working crew from the California Division of Corrections. Crew members cut 
brush and dug a trail -- skills they employ when they fight fires. These 
efforts earned the men time off from their sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Van Tassel Trail begins at the outskirts of Duarte, which is named after 
Mexican Army Cpl. Andres Avelino Duarte. In 1841, Duarte was given a handsome 
stretch of ranch land at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains by Mexican Gov. 
Juan Alvarado. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Duarte, his title to the rancho was questioned, and he was 
involved in a lengthy court battle after California became a state. The U.S. 
Supreme Court upheld Duarte's land claim in 1878, but by the time he officially 
owned the land, he had had to sell all of it to pay legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: From the Foothill Freeway (210) in Duarte, exit on Mt. 
Olive Drive and head north to Royal Oaks Drive. Turn right and continue to 
Greenbank where you'll turn left, then to Deer Lane where you'll turn right, 
then to Mel Canyon Drive where you'll turn left. Park near Valley View Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Hike: From the end of Mel Canyon Drive, follow the unsigned footpath up the 
brushy slope. At first, the view isn't too inspiring. Down below you'll see the 
605 and 210 freeways in addition to the huge gravel pits of Irwindale, 
including "Raider Crater," the site proposed as the new home of the Los Angeles 
Raiders. The view to the east, where a quarry has chewed up mountainsides, 
isn't very inspiring either. 
</P>
<P>
The trail briefly joins a road and ascends to a fire department helipad, which 
does offer a pretty good view. On a clear day, you'll see the San Gabriel 
Valley, downtown Los Angeles and even Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Continue on the trail a short way past the helipad to an unsigned junction, 
where the trail joins Van Tassel Fire Road. You'll hike around a locked gate 
and begin some steep switchbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The dirt road climbs to a ridgeline and takes you past big cone spruce trees, 
which frame great views of the higher snow-covered San Gabriel peaks. Enjoy the 
panorama from 3,720-foot Mt. Bliss, catch your breath and return the same way. 
</P>
