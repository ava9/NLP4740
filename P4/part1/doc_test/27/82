<TEXT>
<P>
Almost 10 years ago, a new eight-lane stretch of the Riverside Freeway opened, 
bringing relief to Orange County residents making their way through Santa Ana 
Canyon into the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
Where drivers once had to maneuver along a narrow, winding highway, the freeway 
opening meant motorists could go from Anaheim Hills to Corona and on to Palm 
Springs and Las Vegas in record time. 
</P>
<P>
But what was once hailed as a solution to gridlock has turned into one of the 
region's worst nightmares. With the growth of Riverside County beyond anyone's 
expectations, the corridor, within the past five years, has once again become a 
bottleneck. And this time, transportation officials in both counties doubt the 
problem has an easy solution. 
</P>
<P>
Every weekday starting at 4 a.m., commuters heading to jobs in Orange County 
often travel bumper to bumper along the freeway, with traffic jams at times 
extending from Corona to the Costa Mesa Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
These same commuters -- many of whom moved to Riverside County seeking 
affordable housing -- face the same gridlock coming home when eastbound traffic 
backs up for miles. In all, more than 200,000 vehicles pass through the 
corridor every day, and the volume is only getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the worst freeway in Southern California, but it's getting there," 
said Min-Der Day, a civil traffic engineer for the city of Corona. 
</P>
<P>
While potential solutions, ranging from connector roads and parallel routes to 
commuter rails and double-decked freeways, are being proposed, all remain in 
the planning stages. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Riverside and Orange county officials are pinning their hopes on the 
construction of car-pool lanes, one in each direction, that would stretch from 
Magnolia Avenue in Riverside to the Orange Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County will fund most of its portion of the project with money 
generated from a countywide half-cent sales tax passed last year. Construction 
is expected to begin in January. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County still has no funding, and transportation experts warn that if 
lanes are built only in Riverside County, the situation won't be much better 
because traffic will simply become snarled at the county line. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley T. Oftelie, executive director of the Orange County Transportation 
Commission, suggested that Riverside County lend Orange County money so the new 
lanes could be built at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
But Jack Reagan, the executive director of the Riverside County Transportation 
Commission, said he doubts the board would approve such a request. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way we could spend our highway money for a project in another 
county," Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
And even with the car-pool lanes, officials worry that it is too little, too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a start, but it's not going to meet the demand for the next 20 years," 
Day said. "It doesn't matter how big the roadway is, it's not enough. One 
accident is going to stop all the traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Bradley, the executive vice president of the Corona Chamber of Commerce, 
predicted that within two or three years after the lanes open, traffic will 
once again come to a halt because of the heavy growth in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Corona officials say the solution rests in diverting traffic away from Corona. 
They are anxious to do something about the heavy traffic on local streets 
caused by thousands of commuters who cut through Corona to avoid the Riverside 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"People make a parking lot out of our city," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Corona officials are among the most vocal advocates of an alternative, parallel 
route to the Riverside Freeway that would go through the Cleveland National 
Forest. The route, called the Cajalco corridor, would link on the east with the 
existing two-lane Cajalco Road between the Corona Freeway and the Escondido 
Expressway, and on the west with the proposed Foothill or Eastern toll road in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The Riverside County Transportation Commission has commissioned a $285,000 
study of the corridor, Reagan said. The cost of the project, if it ever is 
built, could exceed $500 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County officials say that any such road is bound to run into 
environmental opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"It illustrates the desperation Riverside folks are feeling to find an 
alternate route," Oftelie said. He added that OCTC has been unable to widen the 
Ortega Highway, an existing route through the same forest, because of 
environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Orange County officials are studying the idea of a commuter train 
that would link the two counties along existing track that runs parallel to the 
freeway, said Kia Mortazavi, the manager of highway programs with OCTC. The 
project could be partially funded with revenue generated from the state gas-tax 
initiative, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But what could ultimately alter the traffic flow is a gradual shift in jobs to 
Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
"(Employees) can't work well when they're blown away in their fatigue," Reagan 
said. "It's going to happen. We just want it to happen quicker." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposed Riverside Freeway Solutions 
</P>
<P>
1. Addition of a car-pool lane in each direction from the Orange Freeway to 
Magnolia Avenue in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
2. Commuter train on existing Santa Fe rail track. 
</P>
<P>
3. /4. Corona expressway connector road through Tonner and Soquel canyons. 
</P>
<P>
5. Cajaico Expressway through Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
6. Proposed Foothill toll road.
