Procedures for accurate identification of crash locations on all roads and streets which identify crash experience
on specific sections of the road and street system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methods to produce an inventory of high crash locations experiencing sharp increases as well as design and operational
features with which high crash frequencies or severities are associated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appropriate measures to reduce crashes and evaluate the effectiveness of safety improvements on any specific section
of the road or street system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A systematically organized method to ensure continuing surveillance of the roadway network for potentially high
crash locations and the development of methods for their correction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Design guidelines relating to safety features such as sight distances, horizontal and vertical curvature, spacing
of decision points, width of lanes, etc. for all new construction or reconstruction at least on expressways, major
streets and highways, and through streets and highways.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Street systems that are designated to provide a safe traffic environment for all roadway users when subdivisions
and residential areas are developed or redeveloped.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Efforts to ensure that roadway lighting is provided or upgraded on a priority basis at: expressways and other major
arteries in urban areas, junctions of major highways in rural areas, locations or sections of streets and highways
which have high ratios of night-to-day motor vehicle and/or pedestrian crashes, and tunnels and long underpasses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidelines for pavement design and construction with specific provisions for high skid resistance qualities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A program for resurfacing or other surface treatment with emphasis on correction of locations or sections of streets
and highways with low skid resistance and high or potentially high crash rates susceptible to reduction by providing
improved surfaces.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Efforts to ensure that there is guidance, warning and regulation of traffic approaching and traveling over construction
or repair sites and detours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A method for systematic identification and tabulation of all rail-highway grade crossings and a program for the elimination
of hazards and dangerous crossings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Projects which provide for the safe and efficient movement of traffic, by ensuring that roadways and the roadsides
are maintained consistent with the design guidelines which are followed in construction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Identify and correct hazards within the highway right-of-way.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wherever possible for crash prevention and crash survivability, efforts to include at least the following highway
design and construction features:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Roadsides which are clear of obstacles, with clear distance determined on the basis of traffic volumes, prevailing
speeds, and the nature of development along the street or highway;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supports for traffic control devices and lighting that are designed to yield or break away under impact wherever appropriate;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Protective devices that afford maximum protection to the occupants of vehicles where fixed objects cannot be reasonably
removed or designed to yield;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bridge railings and parapets which are designed to minimize severity of impact, to retain the vehicle, to redirect
the vehicle so that it will move parallel to the roadway, and to minimize danger to traffic below; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guardrails, and other design features which protect people from out-of-control vehicles at locations of special
hazard such as playgrounds, schoolyards and commercial areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A post-crash program that includes at least the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Signs at freeway interchanges directing motorists to hospitals which have emergency care capabilities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maintenance personnel who are trained in procedures for summoning aid, protecting others from hazards at crash sites,
and removing debris;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions for access and egress for emergency vehicles to freeway sections where this would significantly reduce
travel time without reducing the safety benefits of access control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comprehensive resource development plan to provide the necessary traffic engineering capability, including:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions for supplying traffic engineering assistance to those jurisdictions which are unable to justify a full-time
traffic engineering staff;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions for upgrading the skills of practicing traffic engineers, and providing basic instruction in traffic
engineering techniques to other professionals and technicians.
