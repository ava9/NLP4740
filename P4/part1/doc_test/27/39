BERKSHIRE County Council has awarded one of the largest local government
contracts to the Babtie Group, the Glasgow-based consulting engineers, to
manage its highway and planning services.
Babtie will receive more than Pounds 30m over four years to handle the
council's traffic and road safety services, highway maintenance and waste
management. The council said it was the first local authority to hand over
its highways and planning services to a private-sector contractor.
Mr Tony Allen, the council's chief executive, said: 'The government is
planning to extend compulsory competitive tendering to highways and planning
services in the very near future and we feel we have given our highways and
planning staff a more secure future by getting in first and being in control
of the situation.'
He said the council expected the contract to mean savings of Pounds 1.3m in
1993-94 and increased amounts after that.
Babtie will assume responsibility for traffic monitoring, traffic signals,
bus schemes and highway and bridge maintenance. It will be responsible for
road safety strategy and accident prevention and investigation. It will also
take over waste recycling, landfill design, pollution control and
monitoring, and preparation of waste disposal contracts.
Of the council's 383 highway and planning staff, 309 will become Babtie
employees. Twenty will continue to work for the council, managing the
contract. There will be 14 compulsory redundancies and 14 temporary staff
will leave. Twenty-six are taking voluntary redundancy, the council said.
