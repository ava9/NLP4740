Traffic congestion strangling California freeways may become the most important 
environmental and economic issue of the decade, according to two very different 
groups, the Sierra Club and the more conservative Californians for Better 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
In its annual "Green State of the State" report released today, the Sierra Club 
warned that, unless dramatic changes are made in California's transportation 
system, the state is headed for worsening traffic congestion and environmental 
catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
"Transportation is California's environmental issue of the decade," the club 
contended, and the masses of cars carrying only the driver are what "fuel the 
problems of smog, global warming, oil spills and contamination." 
</P>
<P>
Putting the traffic problems in economic terms, Californians for Better 
Transportation reported that the rapidly increasing congestion on the state's 
freeways and urban streets already costs motorists $17 billion a year in lost 
time, increased fuel and car repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Transportation may be the economic issue of the '90s," said Ray Remy, a 
spokesman for the highway lobby group and president of the Los Angeles Area 
Chamber of Commerce. "If we can't move goods and people, that is only going to 
have increasing economic consequences." 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club and Californians for Better Transportation strongly support the 
complex gasoline tax measure that will be on the June ballot. The proposition 
would allow the state to raise $18 billion over the next 15 years to fight 
congestion and to come up with mass transit alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is the problem more acute than in Southern California. Los Angeles 
leads the nation in every negative traffic indicator, according to a third new 
traffic study. No other big city relies so heavily on already congested 
freeways and urban streets to move people and goods, according to the study by 
Texas A&amp;M University transportation experts. 
</P>
<P>
The nut of the problem is that transportation expenditures have not kept pace 
with California's rapid population growth. As a result, traffic in urban areas 
such as Southern California and San Francisco is grinding to a halt. California 
now is last among states in highway spending per mile, and funds for rapid 
transit projects have been cut back in the past decade, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, traffic has increased by 55% since 1980 and now stands at 241 
billion vehicle-miles a year, but the miles of new road construction have 
increased less than 2% in the same period. Two-thirds of the existing roads are 
in "fair to very poor condition," and the cost of bringing them up to good 
standards is estimated at $8.6 billion, according to Californians for Better 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club report -- called "Heading the Wrong Way: Redirecting 
California's Failed Transportation Policy" -- sharply criticized government at 
all levels over the past quarter-century, contending that politicians have 
failed to fund, build and maintain a modern transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists take dead aim at those developers and government agencies 
that have carved up rural areas, creating urban sprawl that in turn puts more 
traffic on already overburdened freeways and roads. The new highways and 
freeways that have followed such developments have been built at public expense 
for private gain without thought to environmental damage, the club charged. 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles, an astonishing two-thirds of the urban space is dedicated to 
transportation," the club's experts reported. They said that cars account for 
more than half the state's urban air pollution and that highway expansion 
projects damage or destroy wildlife habitats. 
</P>
<P>
"How we solve the problems created by the state's worsening transportation 
system is the most important environmental decision California will make going 
into the 21st Century," the Sierra Club concluded. The club is demanding that 
more emphasis be put on getting drivers to car-pool or ride-share and that more 
effort be put into developing urban mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
While the Sierra Club and Californians for Better Transportation are very 
different groups -- the one representing environmentalists, the other a 
coalition of highway user groups -- their studies have brought them to many of 
the same conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic congestion is threatening to shut down the state's road and highway 
system," said Jack Maltester, president of Californians for Better 
Transportation. And the results have a direct impact not only on the movement 
of goods and services, but on the motorist's pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
The highway group's report found that by 1988 congestion had added 20 minutes 
to the average commuter's drive time, and that figure is expected to double or 
triple in the next 10 years if nothing is done. The average motorist pays 
$1,200 a year because of the delays, added fuel and repair costs, the report 
stated. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, traffic congestion is expected to cost commuters and their 
employers even more in lost time, wages, fuel and vehicle maintenance by the 
year 2010 than it will cost residents and businesses in Los Angeles County, 
according to the Southern California Assn. of Governments, a regional planning 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
That's because Orange County began experiencing tremendous growth with fewer 
freeway and major arterial miles in place, and because there are fewer 
alternate routes available to motorists when tie-ups occur, transportation 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
If transportation projects already planned and funded are completed, traffic 
congestion will cost Orange County residents and businesses a total of $9 
billion annually by the year 2010, compared to $8.8 billion in Los Angeles, 
studies show. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the last year for which such estimates are available, congestion cost 
Orange County residents and businesses an estimated $392.1 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line, Maltester said, is that the state's motorists are "paying a 
premium to drive on rough, congested roads."
