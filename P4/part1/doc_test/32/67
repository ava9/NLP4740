THE SHOW: "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" 
</P>
<P>
THE SET-UP: Based on the veeeery popular comic book/cartoon characters created 
by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, this film charts the adventures of a quartet 
of rambunctious mutant teen-age turtles who live in the sewers of New York, 
where they fight crime. With the help of human reporter April O'Neil (Judith 
Hoag) and martial artist vigilante Casey Jones (Elias Koteas), the teen-age 
turtles chase after The Foot, a gang of street kids and ninja warriors. Therein 
lies the tale.

THE LOOK: The turtle's togs in foam rubber are manufactured by the wizardly Jim 
Henson, creator of The Muppets. But there is a Raymond Chandler style trench 
coat and hat disguise one turtle wears, which costume designer John Hay put 
together. Clothes for the sinister ninja Foot gang are the typical, Kung Fu 
black belt variety. But the Shredder's samurai-like costume is awesome, based 
on early designs by the comics creators Eastman and Laird. About the totally 
radical cape, Hay said, "We had a whole superstructure under it to keep the 
fabric out and flowing. The fabric is a synthetic that is over dyed and 
over-sprayed." The grungy street wear for actor Elias Koteas is off the rack. 
The same is true for Judith Hoag as reporter April O'Neil. "We decided against 
the yellow jumpsuit April wears in the comics," said Hay. She needed to look 
more like a modern, TV anchor woman.

THE LABELS: Hey, get real! Turtles don't NEED labels! However, sidewalk vendors 
in Soho and the East Village in New York provided most of the 500 outfits Hay 
needed for the Foot gang. And since the film was made last summer, in a very 
hot North Carolina, most clothing decisions were made for comfort and a quick 
change.

THE WRAP UP: Ninja wear could be the hot fashion look for night prowlers this 
summer -- a turtleneck, tight pants and subtle shoes, all black, along with a 
bold colored headband. And turtle togs could win the race for daytime's 
trendiest pre-teens. Already the look has flooded the pajama and T-shirt 
markets. And we saw a kid wearing a turtle mask the other day. SUE MARTIN
