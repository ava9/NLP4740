<P>
With "Santa Barbara" winning six Emmys, including best soap opera honors for 
the second consecutive year, NBC had something to crow about Thursday at the 
16th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, which televised the two-hour ceremonies at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel here, 
won a total of seven Emmys, followed by ABC with five, syndicated programs with 
three, CBS with two and PBS with one. 
</P>
<P>
It was a day of disappointment, however, for Susan Lucci, who was making her 
10th bid to win a best actress Emmy as Erica Kane of ABC's "All My Children." 
That honor went instead to Marcy Walker, who plays Eden Capwell on "Santa 
Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
Other "Santa Barbara" cast members who picked up Emmys were Nancy Lee Grahn 
(who plays Julia Wainwright) as best supporting actress, Justin Deas (Keith 
Timmons) as best supporting actor, and Justin Gocke (Brandon Capwell) as best 
juvenile male. It was the second consecutive win for Deas. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Barbara" also won for best writing on a daytime serial, bringing its 
total Emmys this year to eight. In nontelevised ceremonies for the craft 
categories last Saturday, the NBC soap had been honored for makeup and 
hairstyling. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Lucci's loss, "All My Children" won other tributes Thursday. David 
Canary was a repeat winner as best actor in a soap opera, honored for the 
second straight year for his dual roles of Adam and Stuart Chandler, and Debbi 
Morgan (who plays Angie Hubbard) shared supporting actress honors with Grahn of 
"Santa Barbara." Canary also had won in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
For the third year in a row, "The Oprah Winfrey Show" was named daytime's best 
talk show. But neither Winfrey nor nine-time winner Phil Donahue won as best 
talk show host. They lost out to Sally Jessy Raphael for the syndicated series 
that bears her name. 
</P>
<P>
Public television's "Newton's Apple," the 6-year-old science magazine, was 
named best children's series, and ABC's "The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh" 
won as best animated program. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' "The $25,000 Pyramid" was named best game show, while Alex Trebek picked 
up the award as best game show host for his work on the syndicated "Jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
In the first year that they were eligible for Daytime Emmys, cable programs did 
not win any during Thursday's ceremonies. But the cable industry had picked up 
four of the golden statuettes at the nontelevised event last Saturday. HBO's 
children's series "Encyclopedia" won two, for makeup and costume design, 
Cinemax's "James Stewart's Wonderful Life" captured a special program award and 
the Disney Channel's "Kids Incorporated" picked up an Emmy for lighting 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
Counting the craft awards, CBS wound up with a total of 17 Daytime Emmys. NBC 
had nine, PBS got eight, ABC and syndicated programs collected seven each. 
</P>
<P>
During the telecast Thursday, Victoria Wyndham of NBC's "Another World" paid 
tribute to her longtime co-star in the series, Douglass Watson, who died May 1. 
A former Emmy winner, he had been posthumously nominated for again as best soap 
opera actor. 
</P>
<P>
Wyndham, who worked with Watson for 16 years, called him "a risk taker, 
exacting and a gentleman. He gave 100%. . . . He was generous with his 
compliments and gentle with his criticism. He was the perfect acting partner." 
</P>
<P>
The Daytime Emmys, covering the period between March 6, 1988, and March 5, 
1989, were presented jointly by the Los Angeles-based Academy of Television 
Arts &amp; Sciences and the New York-based National Academy of Television Arts 
and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Awards for prime-time programming will be presented Sept. 17.
