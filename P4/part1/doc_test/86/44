Wilacre Park, Fryman Overlook, Coldwater Canyon Park and Franklin Canyon Ranch 
-- these four recreation areas comprise Cross Mountain Park. Individually and 
collectively, they contribute some much-needed breathing room to the San 
Fernando Valley side of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Betty P. Dearing Trail -- or Dearing Mountain Trail, as it's usually called -- 
connects Fryman Overlook with Coldwater Canyon Park and Wilacre Park. The trail 
honors a determined conservationist for her efforts to create a trail across 
the Santa Monica Mountains from Los Angeles to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
The trail begins in the wilds of Studio City in Wilacre Park, the former estate 
of silent-movie cowboy Will Acres. The land was saved from the bulldozer by 
environmentalists and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy in 1982. From the 
park's high points, great clear-day vistas of the San Fernando Valley await the 
urban mountaineer. 
</P>
<P>
The trail continues to Fryman Overlook on Mulholland Drive, where the 
aforementioned valley vistas are even more terrific. From the overlook, you can 
follow a path and a suburban street back to Wilacre Park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TreePeople Outpost 
</P>
<P>
Between the panoramic viewpoints is Coldwater Canyon Park, headquarters of 
TreePeople. The group's well-publicized tree-planting campaign has contributed 
a great deal to the greening of Los Angeles. You can learn about TreePeople's 
work by visiting its exhibits, landscaping display, nursery and headquarters. 
And you can learn about the trees by taking Magic Forest Nature Trail, which 
winds through the preserve. 
</P>
<P>
Along Dearing Mountain Trail, you'll observe two human alterations of the 
landscape. One alteration is botanical; many exotic trees and shrubs grow on 
the steep slopes of Coldwater and Fryman canyons. TreePeople headquarters once 
was Fire Station 108, built by the Los Angeles Fire Department in 1923. During 
the years the firefighters were in residence, eucalyptus, pine and many other 
kinds of non-native trees were planted in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Another alteration is the terracing of hillsides to create pads for the 
construction of homes. Building on steep slopes is, of course, prevalent in 
canyons all over Southern California, but in the Coldwater-Laurel Canyon area 
it has reached ridiculous heights. The hiker looks up at some truly astonishing 
residences -- homes on stilts, homes built stairstep-like down precipitous 
canyon walls, homes that seem certain to slide down to Ventura Boulevard after 
the first good rain. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: From the Ventura Freeway in Studio City, exit on 
Laurel Canyon Boulevard and drive south 1 1/2 miles to Fryman Road. Turn right 
and immediately park. The unsigned trail begins at a yellow vehicle gate. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: Ascend the asphalt road past bay laurel and towering toyon, walnut 
trees and assorted planted pines. The road retires to dirt and soon proffers 
those terrific views of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
At a wide spot in the road, a bit more than a mile from the trailhead, you'll 
intersect Coldwater Canyon Park's Magic Forest Trail. You may continue on 
Dearing Mountain Trail, still a dirt road at this point. If you want a little 
break, detour right on the park's nature trail. Ascend one of the handsome 
stone staircases, built by the WPA in the 1930s, to the domain of the 
TreePeople. After learning about the group's tree-planting efforts, rejoin 
Dearing Mountain Trail. 
</P>
<P>
A half-mile descent on the trail brings you past the backside of some homes, a 
yellow vehicle gate, and down to Iredell Street. Walk 50 yards on the street 
and rejoin Dearing Mountain Trail at another yellow gate. After 100 yards, the 
trail junctions. Stay left and begin a short but very steep ascent up a 
terraced slope. 
</P>
<P>
The trail then descends to the head of a ravine that's watered by a seasonal 
creek and shaded by towering eucalyptuses. Frogs provide musical accompaniment 
to the path, which traverses the canyon wall, then dips again to the bottom of 
another ravine. Unfortunately, this ravine and its tiny creek are below one of 
Mulholland Drive's "deadman's curves" and has become the final resting place 
for a dozen wrecked autos. Minus the junkyard, this little dell would be a 
pretty spot. 
</P>
<P>
The trail ascends moderately up the chaparral-covered south wall of Fryman 
Canyon to Mulholland Drive and Fryman Overlook. From the overlook, you can see 
much of the San Fernando Valley. Beyond the valley, smog-free views also take 
in the Verdugo, Santa Susana and San Gabriel mountain ranges. 
</P>
<P>
Fryman Overlook displays two commemorative plaques. One praises Mulholland 
Drive, brainchild of William Mulholland, chief engineer of the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power, who in 1913 proposed a 55-mile scenic road 
through the Santa Monica Mountains. Betty P. Dearing (1917-1977) is honored for 
her efforts to "create a nature walk from Los Angeles to the sea." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roads Outdid Trails 
</P>
<P>
Road builders have been more successful than trail builders in the Santa 
Monicas. While Mulholland Drive was constructed in the early 1920s, the 
Backbone Trail has yet to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
Physical fitness fans not content with the workout afforded by this hike can 
proceed to Fryman Overlook's exercise course. The less energetic will head for 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Return a short distance on Dearing Mountain Trail to a junction; instead of 
descending the way you came, keep straight and follow the sage- and toyon-lined 
path as it heads east below Mulholland Drive. The trail turns north, then east 
again and soon junctions. 
</P>
<P>
Take the left fork and descend steeply down a mustard-cloaked hillside to a 
dirt fire road. Turn left on the fire road, which, after a 100 yards, continues 
as a concrete path and descends to a yellow gate at the corner of Dona Maria 
Drive and Fryman Road. Follow Fryman Road three-fourths of a mile to the 
trailhead at Wilacre Park.
