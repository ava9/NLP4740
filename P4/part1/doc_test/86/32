 We are amending the pine shoot beetle regulations by adding Kendall County, IL; Bay and Clare Counties, MI; Allegany
County, NY; and Delaware and Stark Counties, OH, to the list of quarantined areas. This action is necessary on an emergency
basis to prevent the spread of the pine shoot beetle, a highly destructive pest of pine trees, into noninfested areas
of the United States.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The pine shoot beetle is a highly destructive pest of pine trees. The pine shoot beetle can cause damage in weak and dying
trees, where reproduction and immature stages of pine shoot beetle occur, and in the new growth of healthy trees. The
``maturation feeding'' of young beetles takes the form of boring up the center of pine shoots (usually of the current
year's growth), causing stunted and distorted growth in the host trees. The pine shoot beetle is also a vector of several
diseases of pine trees. Adults can fly at least 1 kilometer, and the wood, nursery stock, and Christmas trees they infest
are often transported long distances. This pest damages urban trees, and can cause economic losses to the timber,
Christmas tree, and nursery industries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations in 7 CFR 301.50 (referred to below as the regulations) impose restrictions on the interstate movement
of regulated articles from quarantined areas in order to prevent the spread of the pine shoot beetle into noninfested
areas of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surveys recently conducted by State and Federal inspectors revealed that Kendall County, IL; Bay and Clare Counties,
MI; Allegany County, NY; and Delaware and Stark Counties, OH, are infested with the pine shoot beetle. The regulations
in &sect;301.50&hyph;3 provide that the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
will list as a quarantined area each State, or each portion of a State, in which the pine shoot beetle has been found by
an inspector, in which the Administrator has reason to believe the pine shoot beetle is present, or that the Administrator
considers necessary to regulate because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities
in which the pine shoot beetle has been found. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with these criteria, we are designating Kendall County, IL; Bay and Clare Counties, MI; Allegany County,
NY; and Delaware and Stark Counties, OH, as quarantined areas, and adding them to the list of quarantined areas in &sect;301.50&hyph;3(c).

Emergency Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an emergency situation exists
that warrants publication of this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is
necessary to prevent the pine shoot beetle from spreading to noninfested areas of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the
public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon signature.
We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the
comments.

Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
About 130 small nurseries, 120 producers of Christmas trees and other forest products, and 31 loggers operate in the
6 newly quarantined counties. All could probably be classified as small entities by Small Business Administration
criteria (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million or less). While most of the small nurseries in these counties specialize
in production of deciduous landscape products, some also produce rooted pine Christmas trees and pine nursery stock.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action will restrict the movement of certain pine products from quarantined areas to non-quarantined areas.
If inspected and found to be infested with the pine shoot beetle, these pine products can be either diverted for sale
within local markets or treated in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;301.50&hyph;10 prior to shipment to a non-quarantined area. Based on information acquired from extension
agents and trade association representatives, we estimate that, in the newly quarantined counties, most producers
of regulated pine products make the majority of their sales locally or to buyers within the quarantined areas and thus
will not be affected by this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few producers, however, notably Christmas tree growers and loggers in Clare County, MI, nurseries in Delaware County,
OH, and loggers in Allegany County, NY, sell approximately half of their regulated pine products to buyers outside
the quarantined areas. But, the reasonable cost of the approved methyl bromide treatment for regulated articles
(approximately $1 per tree) should minimize the economic impact of this action upon these producers. We anticipate,
therefore, that this action will not have a significant economic impact on small nurseries, Christmas tree farmers,
or other forest product producers in the six newly quarantined counties.
