<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated May 3, 1994, Louisiana submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. LA&hyph;348). Louisiana submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. The provision of LSMR
that Louisiana proposes to revise is &sect;53123.B.4, standards for success of revegetation at final bond release
on reclaimed lands developed for forestry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, Louisiana proposes to review &sect;53123.B.4 to require that the success standards for (1) ``live
stems per acre'' shall be

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
450 well-distributed free-to-grow live pine trees per acre of the same age or 250 well-distributed live hardwood
trees per acre of the same age. Countable stems shall be a minimum of 3 years old.

and (2) ``vegetative ground cover'' shall be not less than 70 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Louisiana also proposed to define at &sect;53123.B.4, ``well-distributed'' to mean uniform stocking levels over
an entire planting site, ``free-to-grow'' to mean pine seedlings or saplings without significant hardwood competition,
and to require that

Competing vegetation shade the pine's crown on less than 30% of the crown's circumference and the pines are judged
to have better than a 90% chance of capturing a place in the crown canopy.
