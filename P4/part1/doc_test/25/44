Emirates, the fastest growing Middle East airline, which yesterday won the
Executive Travel Magazine 'Airline of the Year Award,' made a net profit of
Dh10.6m (Dollars 2.9m) for the year ending March 1993 on turnover of
Dh1.8bn.
Mr Maurice Flanagan, the Dubai-based airline's managing director, yesterday
disclosed its financial performance for the first time since the Dubai
state-owned carrier was set up nine years ago.
He said Emirates had operated profitably every year since its constitution
except in its second financial year, ending March 1987.
The airline expects net profits to increase in the current year, although
the total would depend on its expansion plans, Mr Flanagan said.
Net profits for 1992-93 were sharply lower than the Dh67.5m reported for
1991-92 on turnover of Dh1.46bn.
Although 1991-92 coincided with the Gulf war and the most difficult year in
the airline's short history, the record profits that year reflected the fact
that Emirates continued to operate all its flights to Europe and to India
and south-east Asia.
'Although the market diminished significantly during the Gulf war we
massively increased our share of the market,' Mr Flanagan said.
The lower profits last year reflected a 54 per cent increase in the
airline's capacity at a time when the rest of the world airlines industry
was seeking to reduce expansion.
Emirates now flies to 32 destinations and expects passenger numbers to
increase from 1.7m in the year to March 1993 to more than 2m in 1993-94.
Mr Flanagan said the airline received no subsidies from its government
shareholder and was expected to operate under the same tough financial
conditions as other market driven companies. 'We get no favours from our
owners,' Mr Flanagan insisted.
The airline and its associate airport activities employ 7,800 people and
operate a fleet of 13 Airbus wide-body A310 and A300 aircraft and two Boeing
727 narrow-body aircraft.
The airline also has firm orders for seven Boeing 777 wide-body aircraft and
options for an additional seven, all powered by Rolls-Royce Trent engines.
Mr Flanagan said Emirates was planning to expand its services to London next
summer, with additional flights to Gatwick on top of the two daily services
to Heathrow. In the longer term, the airline is considering using its new
Boeing 777s to start non-stop services from Dubai to New York.
