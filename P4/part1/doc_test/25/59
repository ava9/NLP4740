For 30 years, the Arabs of the Persian Gulf lived a gold-plated fairy tale, 
awash with money that transformed their backward little kingdoms into a 
razzle-dazzle of desert opulence. 
</P>
<P>
Other Arabs called them "Gulfies," disdainful of their windfall wealth and 
recent Bedouin heritage. But the 4.2 million people of the gulf paid the 
critics no heed. For they, along with the Saudis of the Arabian Peninsula, were 
the real Arabs -- descendants of the tribes and clans that brought Islam to the 
world -- and together they formed the richest collection of neighbors in the 
world. Vulnerable and isolated -- over the centuries, parts of the Persian Gulf 
have been ruled by the Portuguese, Persians, Turks and British -- the region's 
five city-states saw only two potential obstacles to their pell-mell rush into 
the 21st Century: a collapse in oil prices or an Iranian-inspired Shiite Muslim 
revolution against the royal families, who ran their countries like family 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
That the fairy tale would end with the invasion of Kuwait by ally Iraq was 
never even a subject of whispered speculation. 
</P>
<P>
The painful lesson of the past two weeks for the California-sized cluster of 
gulf states is that their awesome wealth brought neither power nor security. 
They had bought off enemies and courted friends with lavish generosity -- more 
than $600 million a year to subsidize the Palestine Liberation Organization and 
some $30 billion to bankroll Iraq in its war against Iran -- and in the end, 
the Iraqis had simply walked in and taken what they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
In grabbing Kuwait, the largest, wealthiest and most literate of the gulf 
states, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in effect made himself the ruler of the 
Persian Gulf. Among the prizes at stake is Kuwait's Fund for Future 
Generations, a kitty of more than $50 billion that Kuwait invested in the West 
to prepare for the eventual depletion of its oil reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever future now awaits the gulf states, the occupation of Kuwait ends a 
chapter of Middle East history that in its own way was no less dramatic than 
the building of the Panama Canal or the settlement of the American West. 
</P>
<P>
Although they remained the poor rich -- people with money but not skills -- the 
gulf Arabs had traveled farther and faster than any society the world had 
known. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 60 years ago, the Persian Gulf sheikdoms were nothing more than 
medieval frontiers. Bahrain had no paved roads, electricity, flush toilets or 
radios. Doha, the capital of Qatar, was a fishing village with a literacy rate 
of zero. The emir of Abu Dhabi lived in a mud palace. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1970, the year after Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, the 
wooden gates to Muscat, Oman's capital, swung shut each evening at dusk. Those 
walking the streets had to carry a lantern at arm's length and continually 
announce themselves to avoid being shot as strangers. The country had three 
miles of paved road and 12 telephones. 
</P>
<P>
The first sheikdom to strike oil was Bahrain, in 1932. "We didn't think it was 
any big event at the time," a millionaire Bahraini merchant and former pearl 
diver, Mohammed Khajah, recalled some time ago. "Who needed oil? We didn't even 
have any cars on Bahrain then. We'd have been more excited if Socal (Standard 
of California) had struck water." 
</P>
<P>
But the wild escalation of oil prices in the 1970s -- from $3 a barrel in 1973 
to $39 on the spot market six years later -- turned the gulf topsy-turvy. 
Modern cities of marble and glass sprung out of fishing villages. A huge army 
of foreign workers was imported from Egypt, Pakistan and the Philippines to 
staff everything from hospitals to construction crews. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the gulf's underground riches spawned the world's most generous 
welfare system: There were no taxes, no charges for medical care, education or 
public land, and anyone who wanted a free house needed only to ask a king or 
prince. 
</P>
<P>
Men who had known no world beyond their tent suddenly thought nothing of flying 
first-class to London. A new school opened in Saudi Arabia every three weeks. 
Freeways twisted across the desert, and the sheik of Dubai got so exited over 
happenings in his little emirate that he used to ride construction booms up the 
sides of buildings every morning to personally inspect daily progress. 
</P>
<P>
For the gulf states, the 1970s became the Disposable Decade. Some wealthy 
residents tossed out the household furniture every six or seven months and 
changed wardrobes whenever a new line of designs arrived from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabahs of Kuwait and the other royal families who run the neighboring 
states kept what they wanted for themselves, but made sure the immense surplus 
of oil money trickled down to all levels of society. Prosperity bought peace, 
and peace enabled the rulers to continue an incestuous brand of leadership that 
brought an unusual degree of stability to the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Until Iraq's attack, the Sabah family had ruled Kuwait since 1751. Sabahs 
occupied government positions of prime minister, deputy prime minister, 
minister of foreign affairs, minister of interior, minister of defense, 
minister of oil, minister of information, minister of social affairs and 
ambassador to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabahs' cousins, the Khalifas from the Otoub tribe, captured Bahrain from 
the Persians in 1783 and have governed the island ever since. In Qatar, so many 
members of the royal family are in prominent positions, it is said that if one 
Thani gets a nosebleed, every other nose in the country bleeds as well. 
</P>
<P>
Although the excesses of the gulf Arabs attracted negative attention in the 
West, many Mideast watchers believe that the Sabahs and the other rulers 
deserve credit for a great deal of responsible development. 
</P>
<P>
They built an infrastructure of roads and air links and hospitals and 
universities that provides a foundation for the next generation. They developed 
desalination plants and secondary industries, and Saudi Arabia even became a 
wheat exporter (with the government paying Saudi farmers $978 a ton, about five 
times the world market price). 
</P>
<P>
Exactly who will derive the benefit of that infrastructure is suddenly far from 
clear.
