  [Text] Dubai, United Arab Emirates, March 9 (AFP) -- 
Jordan's King Husayn was snubbed in Saudi Arabia and flew home 
Wednesday [9 March] after a Mecca pilgrimage which failed to 
clinch a reconciliation meeting with King Fahd, Arab diplomats 
said. 
  Saudi Arabia's cold reception for King Husayn on his first 
visit since July 1990 before the Gulf crisis was reflected in 
Saudi newspapers, which ignored the trip altogether. 
  The Jordanian monarch was taken aback and cut short his 
visit, during which he had also been expected to visit Moslem 
holy sites in nearby Medina, an Arab diplomat said, declining to 
be named. 
  Arab diplomats had said the two monarchs were to meet in 
Mecca, western Saudi Arabia, where King Fahd was also staying. 
But neither Saudi nor Jordanian officials confirmed that such 
an encounter was scheduled. 
  And yet the Saudi monarch late Tuesday received two 
governors 
from the Emirates, Shaykh Saqir Bin-Muhammad al-Qasimi and 
Shaykh Hamid al-Nu'aymi, who were also on pilgrimage to mark the 
final days of the fasting month of Ramadan. 
  On arrival in Jeddah earlier the same day, King Husayn was 
greeted at the airport by the deputy emir of Mecca, Prince Sa'ud 
Bin-'Abd-al-Muhsin. The same official saw him off. 
  In Amman, a senior official in Jordan's royal court played 
down the snub but Western diplomats criticized Riyadh's attitude. 
  "The aim of the king's visit to Mecca was purely religious" 
and no request was made for a meeting, the official said, 
declining to be named. However, "a gesture of courtesy (from 
King Fahd) would obviously have been welcome." 
  But a Western diplomat said the Saudi monarch's attitude was 
"an insult which shows the Saudis in an extremely bad light." 
  "By travelling to Saudi Arabia, King Husayn held out his 
hand 
to King Fahd who turned it down, contrary to the traditions laid 
down for a head of state and Arab customs," another diplomat 
said. 
  King Husayn's last visit came just two weeks before the 
Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990. 
  Amman-Riyadh ties soured amid Saudi charges that Jordan 
backed Iraqi President Saddam Husayn during the Gulf crisis. 
King Husayn also opposed the US-led military campaign which 
expelled Iraq from Kuwait in February 1991. 
  A Mecca encounter during Ramadan with King Fahd, the 
custodian of Islam's holiest sites in western Saudi Arabia, was 
expected to clear the way for a normalization, Arab diplomats 
said. 
  Since the Gulf war, Amman has sought to resume normal 
contacts with Riyadh, which had punished Jordan by halting its 
annual financial aid of 200 million dollars and oil shipments, 
and closing its markets to Jordanian goods. 
  After King Fahd sent his Washington ambassador to see King 
Husayn recovering from an operation in a US hospital in August 
1992, Jordan's monarch moved swiftly to announce that their 
misunderstanding was almost over. 
  But the Saudis -- whose Amman ambassador has yet to return 
to 
his post after having been recalled in October 199O -- insist on 
a public apology from Jordan for its stand on the Gulf crisis, a 
demand which King Husayn has criticized. 
  An Arab diplomat pointed out that PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, 
who was also snubbed for three years because of his pro-Iraqi 
sympathies, managed to meet King Fahd during a similar 
pilgrimage to Mecca in January. 
  But the start of a Palestinian-Saudi normalization only came 
after PLO officials made their apologies to Riyadh, which before 
the Gulf crisis was a key financial backer with its oil wealth. 
  For Jordan, ties with Saudi Arabia have traditionally been 
complicated because of old rivalries between the two ruling 
families. 
  While King Fahd is custodian of Mecca and Medina, King 
Husayn 
is a grandson of the Sharif of Mecca, Husayn, who was chased out 
of the Hejaz in the 1920s by the Sa'uds after his Hashemi family 
had ruled in Mecca since the 11th century. 
  Only last month, Amman brokered a peace deal to resolve the 
political crisis in Yemen, a country which Riyadh considers to 
be in its sphere of influence.
