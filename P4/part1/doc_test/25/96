Her Majesty's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Mr David Gore-Booth, paced the
marbled floor of Jeddah Hamra palace in shock: 'That was incredible,
astonishing, unprecedented.'
It was well after 2am and King Fahd, Custodian of the two Holy Mosques and
head of the House of Saud, had just left in one of his favourite, old
Mercedes limousines after lengthy talks with Prince Charles, heir to the
British throne.
The king had already turned convention and protocol on its head with his
last-minute decision to meet the prince on his arrival from Riyadh. The
conversation, lubricated with glasses of carrot and kiwi fruit juice, began
with the inevitable pleasantries about families and ambassadors but quickly
moved up a gear.
Shortly before his recent, week-long trip to the Middle East, Prince Charles
had publicly attacked the regime of Saddam Hussein and called for closer
understanding between the world of Islam and the west. He was highly tickled
by reports that his words had triggered a fall in the Iraqi dinar.
King Fahd, the first of his many Middle East hosts, was appreciative of the
speech, expressing unqualified admiration and respect for his visitor. Mr
Gore-Booth is not a man to wear his emotions on his sleeve. But the
ambassador, casting diplomatic restraint into the hot, night air, was
gob-smacked.
King Fahd's message of gratitude was to be repeated ad infinitum as the
prince - no longer part of the world's most famous royal double-act -
progressed across a region where royalty still counts. Here, royal families
not only dispense patronage but award commercial contracts carrying
billion-dollar tags; here a British prince can pack the sort of punch which
often eludes him at home.
His arrival in Saudi Arabia set the tone for a hectic tour of duty run at a
ridiculous pace. But despite the flag-waving and flummery which enveloped
the royal visit, there was a serious sub-plot. Prince Charles had come to
bat for Britain.
Increasingly, his trips abroad are being carefully constructed to maximise
commercial spin-off for British companies. According to one of the prince's
team: 'Their function has changed; he is not wheeled out as a zoo exhibit.'
The prince himself is not worried that his unique position is being used to
help trade, hoping instead that it 'filters down to benefit our own
companies'. Indeed, he believes he is under-exploited and is desperately
keen for Whitehall to do something about it. He was bemused because there
had been a row over the availability of the VC10 for the Middle East trip. A
minor, inter-departmental skirmish maybe, but he believes it demonstrated
the low priority given by Whitehall to such visits.
The prince has already made one behind-the-scenes attempt to enlist the help
of government in devising a co-ordinated strategy for using him and his
foreign excursions to best effect in selling Britain.
An invitation eight years ago from Kensington Palace to representatives of
ministries and trade bodies to consider the issue came to nothing. It
floundered, he believes, in an atmosphere of national short-termism which he
thinks still persists, and on the inability of government to orchestrate
initiatives across departments.
'Things can be properly co-ordinated in Wales and Scotland because each has
only one secretary of state. Why can't it be done for the nation as a
whole?' he inquires.
Now that ministers, particularly in the Department of Trade and Industry,
have given exports a high political priority, the prince's office wants to
try again to build more effective links with government departments to
maximise the value of royal missions. One aide says: 'Parts of Whitehall
still see royal visits in an anachronistic way. A certain amount of
re-education is required and is under way.'
It is impossible to evaluate the commercial contribution of a 45-year-old
trainee head of state who cannot return home with signed contracts in a
crested briefcase. But, merely by virtue of who he is, he can forge personal
relationships which can lead to commercial alliances. As another member of
his inner-circle puts it: 'He can cut ribbons and unveil any number of
plaques. But much more importantly, he can open doors.'
The prince is the first to acknowledge the difficulty in assessing his value
in this respect. On his visits abroad, he says he wants to develop his role
as 'a cultural and commercial emissary', acting on behalf of a country for
which he cares deeply but which he believes often undersells itself. He
regularly alludes to the way some of Britain's European competitors beat
their own drums more effectively than UK plc.
His influence is now felt overseas through organisations such as the
business leaders' forum, the newest of his business-led charities which is
aimed at getting British companies to help the development of emerging
economies. In spite of the endless suggestions that the heir to the throne
is emerging from his own annus horribilis to search for a newly-defined
role, he insists it has never changed. Whether his value is perceived to be
as great elsewhere, given his recent personal traumas, remains open to
question.
'The idea I am searching to redefine my job is rot. It is just that, since
the day I got married, people have chosen to ignore the things I continue to
do day in and day out.'
The Prince of Wales has been starring in what he concedes has been a 'soap
opera', from which, so far, it has been impossible to escape. His eyebrows
rise in exasperation at the alternative, tabloid agenda which usually
chooses to neglect his best endeavours in favour of what he sees as
irrelevant, sometimes malicious trivia.
None of this may cut much ice with those who believe the royal family is an
expensive irrelevance whose time has passed. The critics' convictions will
only have been reinforced by the distractions of the past few years.
In Kuwait, the prince's men were again forced on to the defensive, trying to
keep newspaper reporters away from excited, expatriate schoolchildren in
case journalists fed them loaded questions to embarrass their special
visitor. Later, there was despair at newspaper stories claiming the prince
had made a 'gaffe' by talking to a French Mirage pilot at the Dubai air
show. British princes, it seems, are only supposed to talk to British
companies. Prince Charles now hopes, perhaps in vain, that he can begin to
refocus public attention on his serious role and on a broad range of issues
 -such as inner cities and architecture. The growing personal support team
which operates from roomy offices overlooking Ambassador's Court at St
James's share his objectives. Those closest to him say he is 'a driven man',
determined to fulfil a role which has never been written down and which he
has largely created for himself. His determined sense of purpose sometimes
provokes an ill-tempered outburst against those who might see things
differently.
In spite of the pressures, he is healthy, despite a nagging, polo-induced
back injury which has left him with an uneasy gait. He needs little sleep,
though the contemplative calm of a church service in Kuwait brought on
obstinately heavy eyelids which threatened to hand the tabloids another
headline. Before returning to London, he stole a few, private hours in the
sunshine at King Hussein's seaside palace in Aqaba, most of them spent
ploughing through the pile of official papers at his side. Such commitment,
he pleads, would not be shared by the sort of international playboy he could
have been.
There was no time for play as the prince criss-crossed Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates, taking coffee and sweetmeats with kings, crown princes
and prime ministers. Whatever the cynics might say, the British companies he
called on last week were in no doubt that the visit was worth the prince's
weight in riyals.
Mr Peter Marshall, managing director of John Brown Engineering, was among
the royal visitor's hosts when he called in on the Pounds 120m Ibn Zahr
plastics plant project at Jubail, in Saudi Arabia's eastern province.
Did it help? 'Are you kidding? You can't put a value on his visit. It
brought together some very influential people and helped reinforce the idea
of British commitment to the region.' Mr Marshall will shortly return to
Jubail, where he is told the visit has helped to create the right climate to
carry forward negotiations on another Pounds 110m project.
On the other side of the kingdom, in Jeddah, Mr Patrick Arnold, chairman of
the local British businessmen's group, gave the same message: 'Competition
here is tough. But there is a lot of pro-British sentiment and this visit is
a tremendous confidence booster for UK companies.'
British ambassadors, who once might have measured the success of such a
royal visit by the size of their cocktail parties, believe the prince's
commercial value is exceptional. Mr William Fullerton, the Foreign Office's
man in Kuwait, says there have been three recent trade missions from the UK
and that the prince's visit will mean continuing goodwill towards visiting
groups. The prince's Arab hosts think likewise. Dr Jasim Mohhamed Alansani,
commercial director for the development of the industrial city of Jubail,
says: 'The prince's visit will directly help British companies in their
fight for work.'
Despite such endorsements, the team at St James's believes that much more
can be done. The prince's latest visit, for example, proved immensely more
effective because of his earlier speech.
He cannot always have on hand a weighty address relevant to the interests of
his hosts, but the idea of more thoroughly preparing the ground, perhaps
through linked ministerial visits, is one to be more fully explored. Another
way of heightening the impact of his trips could be to orchestrate immediate
follow-up business missions able to exploit the warm glow left in the wake
of royalty.
There is in place a system to help devise and plan missions for members of
the royal family, overseen by the royal visits committee, chaired by Sir
Robin Butler, cabinet secretary. The Foreign Office, which picks up the
bills for overseas royal visits but which gives such expenditure low
priority, plays a pivotal role in drawing up an annual programme and
advising on who goes where.
The DTI, which has tiny resources, also plays a part. Its UK-based market
intelligence operation provides pre-trip briefings and, for the prince's
Gulf trip, helped organise a seminar in Saudi Arabia on energy and the
environment.
But Gen Sir Peter de la Billiere, commander of British forces during the
Gulf war, who accompanied the prince around the region, believes - like
others in the Royal circle - that a more all-encompassing, strategic
approach designed to make the best of a very British asset is needed.
Sir Peter, a director of Flemings, the London-based merchant bank which has
built a permanent presence in the region, is clear about the prince's
special value: 'There are some very heavy-hitters in the business world out
here, particularly the Americans. Royalty can provide a very effective
counterweight to that sort of approach.'
There was no doubt that Prince Charles had a magnetic effect on his royal
hosts during his visit. But that reaction is highly unlikely to be repeated
so easily when he meets a more cynical public in republican-leaning
Australia in January. The commercial benefits there may be a lot more
elusive.
In Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, cavalcades of limousines conveyed guests
to the gangway of Her Majesty's yacht Britannia, where they were entertained
to a modest dinner devised as a simple antidote to the excesses of the
banquets on shore.
As the Royal Marines played selections from Smetana and Strauss, British
businessmen chatted with royalty, politicians and their own counterparts
from the world of commerce.
Britannia is five years younger than the prince and, with nearly 1m miles on
the clock, its future is at the mercy of a Whitehall machine which doubts
its value and needs to cut costs. Now, perhaps too late, the vessel is
increasingly being made available for commercial use - last week it was at
the centre of Indo-British week in Bombay. Back in Abu Dhabi, as dinner on
board ended and guests prepared to watch the marines 'beating the retreat',
an astonished Arab guest learnt of the yacht's uncertain future.
Sheikh Khalifa Muhairy, chairman of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, was
incredulous. 'You are mad. It is a unique advertisement for your country.
How can its future be in doubt?'
If the Prince of Wales had overheard the question being asked of the 400ft
yacht, he might have been forgiven for thinking it had been directed at the
House of Windsor itself.
