<TEXT>
The United Arab Emirates, trying to harmonise rules within the seven-member
federation in preparation for a possible Gulf Arab common market, yesterday
began levying a 4 per cent tariff on most imports, Reuter reports from
Dubai.
Before the rule took effect, customs departments throughout the UAE were
charging different tariffs. The Higher Council of Tariffs said tobacco
imports, which already attract a 30 per cent government tax, would in
addition pay the new 4 per cent duty. The tobacco tariff might go up to 50
per cent, under a government plan to discourage smoking.
