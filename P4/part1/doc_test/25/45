If you have the money to pay for it, you can get anything in Dubai and if
you can't afford an original there are always some very good copies to be
found. The choice of goods is formidable and even the most ardent, dedicated
shopper would be hard pressed to cover all the retailing areas and the souks
in a week of intense consumerism. Even if this were accomplished, another
centre would open in the interim.
Hub is probably the most over-used term in Dubai - employed to describe the
emirate's role in everything from trade and travel to commerce and sport.
But for shopping it is an appropriate word in the context of the Gulf
region. Although Dubai's facilities are not yet on the scale of Singapore's
dedicated centres, the choice there is vast and prices are low. But
saturation point appears to be nearing as far as the local market is
concerned with over-capacity looming as ever more centres open their doors
with a fanfare of publicity.
A large watch distributor estimated that the existing shops contained three
watches for every man, woman and child in Dubai, many of whom already own
several. This is apart from the designer copies and cheap digital watches
which find their way into the souks and shops in the Indian districts. As
for clothes, a comparable figure may well be the contents of five walk-in
wardrobes per person.
Electrical goods move through Dubai at great speed and all the latest models
of leading brands are available at very competitive prices. Shoppers should
not be deterred by the appearance or size of electronics shops. Dealers
rarely have the time or inclination to display goods properly because they
sell so fast.
The electronics souk near the Ambassador Hotel comprises a host of small
shops selling everything from a mini-calculator to a hi-fi set, but it is
advisable to check whether the warranties are international. Jumbo
Electronics, National Electronics and Eros Electronics are known locally for
their TVs, videos and compact discs. Cassette tapes (Thomsun Originals) are
widely available and cost a mere Dh6 while compact discs retail for Dh60.
Dubai's boutiques offer designer and international brand names at reasonable
prices compared to the fashion houses of Europe. Al Maktoum Street and the
Satwa area have many clothes shops for men and women, as do all the main
shopping centres and hotels. Designer copies, many of them of quite high
quality and well-executed, can be found in the Karama district. A fake
'Chanel' T-shirt at Dh30 is one third the price of an original, while the
price differentials on luggage is even greater - an entire fake 'Gucci'
suitcase and travel set can be bought for less than the cost of an original
Gucci hold-all.
Many of the new shopping malls are eerily empty during the day with only a
few uncomfortable-looking shoppers in the marble-clad halls. The evenings -
traditional shopping hours in Arab countries - are busier. However, the
majority of people are in the coffee shops, pizza restaurants and ice-cream
parlours because the shopping centres serve as meeting places and venues for
family outings. Recognising this, the Galleria complex next to the Hyatt
Regency hotel has built its shopping area around an ice rink.
Residents acknowledge they are spoiled for choice and variously attribute
the lack of shoppers to a variety of factors. 'Everyone is too busy working
to shop,' says one businessman while his wife bemoans the tendency for
shopping centres to open with too much publicity and only a few units. The
Bur Juman centre has only 30 per cent of its units open for retailing one
month after opening, while the Wafi centre near the airport recently secured
Salam stores to bring its occupancy up to 85 per cent - 16 months after its
launch.
Developers and property managers are unperturbed by the apparent lack of
customers. The marketing manager of a large property management agency says:
'We have no Canary Wharf here - all the developments are paid for, there is
no borrowed money on the construction side.'
Such optimism also prevails at the of the Dubai Commerce and Tourism
Promotion Board. Mr Lawrence Mills, the board's chief executive, shrugs off
questions about the proliferation of shopping centres. 'It is up to
individuals where they put their money,' he says. 'Now everyone wants to
build shopping centres, but if the mood and the market change, those
buildings could become hotels, apartments, offices or whatever. . . Dubai is
very adaptable.' The developers continue to 'adapt' - last month Lamcy, the
largest department store in the United Arab Emirates, opened its doors.
Somewhat exaggerating its merits with a claim to contain 'the world and more
in a single store,' the Dh25m complex contains 66 departments, dominated by
Dubai's largest electronics department, spread over 18,000 square feet.
Many of the centres are impressively laid out and well-designed but somewhat
antiseptic and impersonal. Shops display 'fixed prices' signs to notify
would-be customers that there will be no discounts or haggling. This is also
the practice in the main shopping areas, although there is an informal 'last
price' system whereby shopkeepers will climb down from the price shown on
the tag. If a shopper has the time and energy, prices can be beaten down by
five-10 per cent, often through persistence over several days.
Arab antiques and curios such as worry beads, soapstone figures, silver
boxes and pearling knives used by divers can be found in Al Nasr square and
the shopping arcades of hotels, but the prices are quite steep. Inlaid
rosewood boxes from Pakistan and brass camels or coffee pots are around 30
per cent more expensive than the same items in Sharjah's beautiful souk a
20-minute drive away.
It is well worth the effort to visit the upstairs galleries of the
impressive building on the neighbouring emirate's Corniche. Saddle bags,
incense burners, rugs, carpets, muzzle-loading guns and almost any 'Arabian'
or 'Oriental' treasures are jammed into small, dusty shops which have a
distinctly Arab feel.
The time-pressed businessman who cannot trail around all the malls and
centres still cannot avoid the shops - every large hotel has an impressive
arcade selling everything from razor blades to designer ball gowns. Shopping
is unavoidable in Dubai - even if you try to leave without having set foot
in a single retail establishment the Dubai Duty Free in the airport beckons.
The complex has more than 20 shops and is the largest single duty-free
operation in the world. There is even a Duty Free for arriving passengers.
Considering all the temptations, it is hardly surprising that Emirates
airline makes more money on excess baggage than it does at the duty free
shop.
In contrast to the often echoing emptiness of the shopping centres, Dubai's
souks (markets) are bustling, lively and noisy. In the wholesale market,
running parallel to the Creek on the Deira side, large suitcases full of
cash are opened in shop doorways and row upon row of clothing changes hands.
Narrow streets are jammed with vehicles and people, while goods spill onto
the pavement and cluttered shop windows are obscured by external hanging
displays.
However, the souks are not Arab bazaars such as those in the Maghreb,
Damascus, Cairo or Yemen. Customers are more likely to encounter an Indian
proprietor and will not find the sweet glass of tea, haggling and the
livestock associated with an 'Arab' souk. In essence, the souks are shops,
not stalls, and they are open for business rather than a chat over sludgy
beverages. Even haggling is perfunctory: carefully-cultivated clicks of the
tongue and heavenward glances, feigned disinterest or theatrical horror are
all but wasted. Negotiation is the operative word and discounts, sometimes
sizeable, can be secured but seldom haggled.
Dubai's main souk area comprises seven alleys of assorted shops -
predominantly hardware, household items and clothes. Located near the main
abra (water taxi) station, it adjoins the spice souk and a short distance
away is the gold market. A far cry from the 'dark caves' described by
Wilfred Thesiger, the British explorer, in 1948, the souk nevertheless
retains its own character despite being surrounded by extensive building and
development in recent years. Mostly cheap and cheerful though the wares are,
it is unlikely the casual visitor would wish to purchase brightly-coloured
foam mattresses or cauldron-like cooking pots. But some of the side streets
house more interesting shops where curios and Arab artefacts such as
hubble-bubble pipes, veils and falconry accoutrements can be found.
Asense of Dubai's history is evoked in the nearby spice souk. Sacks of
cardamom, saffron, coffee and rose petals are stacked in a covered alleyway
while the small shops are bursting with jars, bowls and bags of assorted
aromatic spices. The smell pervades the area and lingers in the air long
after closing time.
Evocative of times past, the spice souk has a heady atmosphere. Earthenware
incense lamps hang from the ceiling while chillis, dried nuts, apricots,
cumin, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, green and yellow peppers and henna crowd
the shelves in confectionery jars, buckets, jars and other receptacles.
A short walk away from the spice market lies the gold souk. Its rows of
intricate jewellery and lines of orderly shops offer soothing respite after
a walk through the spice market.
It feels almost self-indulgent just to gaze upon the myriad adornments
filling the windows and display cabinets.
The Dh800,000 construction of a parking area, wood-covered walkway and paved
pedestrian area through the souk are underway and thankfully have begun to
restore a semblance of its original character - just before it risked
becoming a gold shopping mall.
All the jewellery is sold by weight and priced according to carat. The
difference is a mere 1 per cent tax which makes it a decidedly attractive
buy.
There is an additional charge of Dh4-Dh15 per gramme for smithed work -
either done by hand in India and shipped to Dubai or machined locally - with
the price depending on the work involved.
Most merchants also deal in precious stones and pearls, for which Dubai was
once famous although for many years the latter have been mainly cultivated
and from Japan. You can be assured that, if you are told that a stone is a
diamond it will not turn out to be cut glass.
The shops in the souk are closely monitored and trade descriptions are
checked.
