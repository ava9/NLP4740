AFTER almost 22 years of federation, Dubai's defence is inextricably bound
up not only with that of the United Arab Emirates, but in a wider sense with
that of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) too. So defence forces stationed
in Dubai are referred to, by virtue of their geographical location at the
centre of the federation, as Central Military Command (CMC), even though
direct authority over CMC is via a chain of command containing only names
from Dubai's ruling family, the Al Maktoum.
CMC's ground forces consist of as many as 15,000 men, out of a total UAE
federal army of 50,000, according to the London-based International
Institute for Strategic Studies. Up to 80 per cent of CMC is comprised of
Omanis from the Batinah coast in the northern part of the country, and the
balance from Dubai.
The ground forces include an armoured regiment equipped with Italian-made
Ottomelara tanks of German design with 105mm guns and British Scorpion
light-track tanks; two infantry brigades; and an anti-tank regiment plus
artillery.
The air force includes an air defence regiment and the Air Wing which has
British-made Hawk and Italian Aeromacchi fighter-trainers.
CMC's titular commander-in-chief is Sheikh Ahmed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the
youngest of the four sons of Sheikh Rashid, Dubai's former ruler and brother
of Sheikh Mohammad, the UAE's minister of defence who was recently promoted
to full general by Sheikh Zayed, the UAE president and ruler of Abu Dhabi.
Sheikh Mohammad is reported to take a very close interest in CMC, as well as
exercising financial control.
The two deputy commanders are Sheikh Ahmed Al Maktoum and Sheikh Butti Al
Maktoum, brothers who are close relations of Sheikh Maktoum, Dubai's ruler.
Both deputy commanders have passed through Britain's officer cadet training
college at Mons near Aldershot. Of the two, Sheikh Butti is the one most
frequently referred to as the day-to-day commander of CMC.
All of the other senior officers, NCOs and warrant officers are from Dubai,
although there are Egyptian and Sudanese training officers plus a few
British, seconded or on contract.
The historical role of a Dubai army has been to protect Dubai itself and,
given the authority wielded by its ruling family, the tradition of retaining
command and control is very much alive.
But today's demands on the UAE impose their own realities on CMC to which it
has responded. During the Gulf war, CMC would have been in a state of
complete readiness. It also provided a large squadron - some 120 men - for a
battalion-size force which the UAE contributed to the US-led coalition. This
battalion was engaged at Khafji on the Saudi-Kuwaiti border, and took some
casualties. Today, CMC has a large squadron as part of the UAE force
attached to the UN forces in Somalia.
Although Abu Dhabi is thought to bear some of the cost of maintaining CMC,
the overwhelming charge is to Dubai's account, and this represents a
significant part of Dubai's direct contribution to the UAE federal budget.
The fact that Sheikh Mohammad, the UAE defence minister, is from Dubai also
gives CMC a political dimension. Like other senior figures in the
federation, he is reported to be a strong supporter for greater defence
co-operation at more levels, especially where defence overlaps with
political and diplomatic issues.
