  [Text] Abu Dhabi, June 12 (AFP) -- The French Giat 
Industries is pressing ahead with a major offset weapons deal 
with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and local officials said it 
will reap benefits for their oil-reliant economy. 
  Officials at the Giat Offset in Abu Dhabi said the 
multi-billion- dollar tank deal signed with the UAE last year 
was proceeding without hurdles and several projects would be set 
up in the Gulf state. 
  "There are no problems at all. We are going ahead with the 
deal and there will be several civilian projects here," one 
official said. 
  He declined to elaborate but UAE offset officials said the 
projects covered farming, banking, industry and other sectors. 
They said they would be set up jointly with national investors. 
  Giat won the tank deal after strong competition from US and 
British companies participating in an international defence show 
in Abu Dhabi in 1993. 
  Under the deal, worth between three billion and four billion 
dollars, it will supply 436 Leclerc main battle tanks from the 
start of 1995. 
  Experts said Giat was awarded the contract after it made a 
more attractive offset offer, including investments yielding 
nearly 60 percent of the deal's value. It was the UAE's biggest 
ever offset deal. 
  Giat President Pierre Chiquet said after the deal was signed 
that projects in the UAE would generate more than two billion 
dollars in 10 years and their turnover in the long run could 
exceed the value of contract. 
  Early this year, the semi official daily Emirates News said 
Giat had decided to restructure its offset programmes in the 
UAE, revising some projects and cancelling a contract with the 
French Offset Partners to supervise projects in the UAE because 
of contractual disagreements. 
  "The deal is going smoothly and there is no doubt it will 
have a positive impact on the economy," a UAE offset official 
said. "It will help us in our efforts to obtain technology and 
diversify the economy." 
  Giat has already launched a project under the offset deal, a 
gas- powered central air-conditioning fabrication facility. 
  Quoting Giat sources, the UAE daily Khaleej Times said on 
Sunday the company would soon embark on a project to build a 
residential complex in Abu Dhabi to accommodate Giat offset 
staff and their families. 
  A Giat spokesman refused to comment on the report, which 
said 
the UAE authorities had agreed to allot a plot of land for the 
project. 
  "The project includes 80 villas to house 300 French families 
expected to come to the country from June next year," Khaleej 
Times said. "They will live in the UAE during the entire 
duration of the deal -- 10 years." 
  It said some of them would be assigned to carry out military 
programmes, including training, maintenance and logistic follow 
up while the others will join the offset members already sent to 
oversee civilian projects. 
  France is the UAE's top arms supplier, which has joined 
other 
wealthy Gulf Arab states in bolstering their armed forces 
following the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
  Officials said the UAE would likely sign military deals 
worth 
one billion dollars a year until 2000. 
  "They all will be on an offset basis," one official said. "I 
think many companies will be interested because our offset 
programme is flexible." 
  The UAE introduced offset programmes five years ago in a bid 
to attract technology needed for its drive to build an 
industrial base to lessen reliance on unstable oil earnings. 
The programme stipulates that arms suppliers re-invest in 
projects that should yield up to 60 percent of the deal's value.
