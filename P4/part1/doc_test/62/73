You wouldn't expect a tour guide to wear tattered jeans and sport a somber 
expression framed by long hair and an even longer beard. Except, perhaps, in 
free-form Venice, where ex-hippie Joe Sigler fits in perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
His business card is a matchbook from the nearby Sidewalk Cafe on Ocean Front 
Walk. He waits there each day for passers-by to stop at his display -- "Joe's 
Venice Walking Tours." 
</P>
<P>
A resident for 33 years, the affable Joe needs no script. He'll set out in any 
direction, tailoring his one-hour commentary to the customer. He can lecture on 
the murals, such as Rip Cronk's "Venice Reconstituted," which depicts several 
characters (including Joe). Or the one-time haunts of the celebrities, like 
Charlie Chaplin's penthouse in the Waldorf Hotel. Or Venice's hideaways, such 
as the tunnels used by rum runners during Prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
Joe, age 48, doesn't sugar-coat his lecture. Take the story of why he abandoned 
his old job as a one-man motorcycle errand service. Someone stole his 
motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
Just when it looked as though L.A. was joining the Cultural Big Leagues, with 
the Getty Museum purchase of Van Gogh's "Irises," the town's other Van Gogh is 
covered over. 
</P>
<P>
It's "Starry Night," as rendered by Scott Dosch on a mural near Joe's station 
off Ocean Front Walk. A Bob Dylan mural was recently slapped over it. 
</P>
<P>
Dylan isn't exactly a sensation these days. Then, again, a whole block of shops 
in that area seem to have experienced some sort of LSD flashback. 
</P>
<P>
Storefronts bear '60s bumper stickers with such utterances as "Goldwater for 
Halloween," newspaper clippings of old anti-police demonstrations, and posters 
of long-dead heroes, like comic Lennie Bruce. There's even an incense-filled 
"head" shop. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on? 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that the Dylan mural and all the rest are props for a coming movie 
about Jim Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
Once the filming's done, the temporary unreality will give way to the true 
unreality. 
</P>
<P>
You mean they didn't already have a rule?: 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District wins our award for most 
disturbing local press release of the day (week/month/year) with this little 
bombshell: 
</P>
<P>
"Air quality officials today committed to developing a rule to phase out by 
1995 the use of a deadly gas at five major industrial facilities in L.A. County 
that could engulf thousands of people in a toxic cloud in the event of a major 
leak." 
</P>
<P>
Al Hix of Hollywood wonders if L.A. has the only dress code for taxi drivers 
that found it necessary to state that skirts would be restricted to female 
cabbies. 
</P>
<P>
MiscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
Why would anyone call a chili dog stand Pink's? It's a question heard more than 
a few times through the years by the founders of the half-century-old Hollywood 
eatery, Paul and Betty Pink.
