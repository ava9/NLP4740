Harold Pinter's first full-length play since Betrayal in 1978 turns out to
be slightly longer than advertised - nearer 85 minutes than 75 without an
interval. It also looks as if it is intended to be his last, for Moonlight
is full of references to the dying of the light without quite the rage that
Dylan Thomas advised should go with it.
There are a few moans to be sure, but for the most part it seems that Pinter
is happy to go gently, leaving his record to be judged as people think fit.
An old man (Ian Holm) lies on his death bed. His wife (Anna Massey) is in
attendance. Three grown up children, two boys and one girl, are at various
times on the stage, though never directly with their father. The
grandchildren, for whom he says he is waiting, do not turn up. A married
couple, old acquaintances of the man and his wife, briefly do.
Nothing much happens. You would not expect it to. The effect depends on
whether you think lines like 'It's enough to make the cat laugh', followed
after the famous Pinter pause by 'Do we have a cat?' are funny. Once, in
early Pinter, they were. Now, I think not. And if not funny, it is hard to
find another justification.
There is some reminiscing. Plainly it has not been the happiest of
marriages, but it has not been the most unhappy either. The husband has had
his infidelities; the wife has dabbled in lesbianism. Yet, you can hear them
saying to themselves, at least they are not quite as suburban as the couple
who turn up to see them.
The sons talk to each other on a separate part of the stage. Here there may
be some parody. They mention places in the south of England as other people
may talk about Monte, and go through lists of names like old soldiers
remembering their regiments. I am unable to elucidate further; possibly it
is the end of old England.
Images of death abound: not only Dylan Thomas, but also The Journey of the
Magi and Shakespeare. 'Take him all in all,' says one of the sons of his
father, 'I shall not look upon his like again.' There is a generous toast to
those who have not made it this far: 'To all those we left behind, to all
those who fell at the first and all consequent hurdles.' Only Prospero is
missing.
Yet if this is really Pinter's farewell, the production could have been
better done. The set, designed by Bob Crowley, is strangely flat: one big
bed and a smaller one almost side by side. The rear part of the stage
remains largely unused, save for the ghostly daughter flapping about in
white. In short, there is not much life, though this may be intentional, in
David Leveaux's directing.
And if the aim is pathos, it would surely have been better to let Pinter
play the leading role. He is, after all, a very good actor, still at the
height of his powers. Then the message would have been unmistakable. But
perhaps he prefers to remain enigmatic to the end.
