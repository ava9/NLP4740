CHURCH'S RIGHT STUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was somewhat disturbed in reading Mike Boehm's review of the Church's opening 
show at the Coach House ("The Right (Same) Stuff," July 14). Most distressing 
was not the essentially negative conclusion of artistic stagnation but rather 
Mr. Boehm's unbelievable abuse of similes. . . . "Like Bob Dylan. . . . Like 
Van Morrison. . . . Like the Beatles." 
</P>
<P>
Such blatant idolization of widely popular artists is deluded. Lack of monetary 
success is not "specialization," and is not the antithesis of mass popularity. 
Wake up. 
</P>
<P>
A band that has so many varied solo projects (nine) and cohesiveness is not to 
be subjected to a historical essay. I think that (Church lead singer) Steve 
Kilbey responded best the other evening to the charges, saying roughly, "It's 
as if we reached an impressive stature by immaculate conception!" Folk roots or 
no folk roots, the Church buried Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and the Beatles last 
night.
