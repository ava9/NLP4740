THE ERN MALLEY AFFAIR by Michael Heyward Faber Pounds 15.99, 284 pages
ONE SATURDAY afternoon in Melbourne in 1943 two clever young men invented
the works of a poet they called Ern Malley. They also invented his life and
character - a lower middle class insurance clerk whose only education had
been in public libraries, who had apparently had an unhappy love affair, and
who had died unknown and alone of Graves' disease at 25. Then they wrote a
carefully semi-literate letter from his sister Ethel, enclosing some of the
poems she had found among his belongings, to Max Harris, surrealist poet and
editor of a determinedly avant-garde magazine called Angry Penguins.
Harris was bowled over. So were his colleagues, John Reed, a rich patron,
and a young painter called Sidney Nolan. Together they produced a special
edition of Angry Penguins to commemorate Ern Malley. The entire oeuvre of 16
poems was introduced by Harris in very excited terms: 'a poet of tremendous
power, working through a disciplined and restrained kind of statement into
the deepest wells of human experience.' For the cover, Nolan produced a very
colourful painting to illustrate Malley's lines: 'I said to my love (who is
living)/ Dear we shall never be that verb/Perched on the sole Arabian
Tree./( Here the peacock blinks the eyes of his multi-pennate tail).'
The hoax was fairly quickly exposed, not through critical judgment, but
through a leak by a journalist friend of the perpetrators. There was the
most tremendous stir. Harris was vilified with orgiastic glee by a press
whose philistinism could show a clean pair of heels to today's Sun.
Then, not satisfied with this demonstration that, as they had always
thought, poetry was bogus, the South Australian authorities prosecuted
Harris for the alleged indecency of his non-existent poet. In a surreal
court case, Detective Vogelesang (later awarded a medal for his successful
prosecution) said at one point, 'l don't know what 'incestuous' means but I
think there is a suggestion of indecency about it.'
All good clean fun. But is it worth a book 50 years later? The answer is
certainly Yes. Robert Hughes, who introduces the book, claims the affair to
have been 'without question, the literary hoax of the 20th century'; and
Michael Heyward's excellent account makes clear why.
First, it was an act of passionate and devastatingly successful literary
criticism. Its authors, James McAuley and Harold Stewart, were to emerge as
distinguished poets in their own right. At the time of the hoax they were
unknown but possessed pseud-detectors as sensitive as their near
contemporaries across the globe - whom they must have resembled in many ways
 -Amis and Larkin. They abominated the surrealist movement represented by
Dylan Thomas and George Barker in England and energetically followed by
Harris, which they saw as inflated, undisciplined rubbish. The Malley affair
stopped the movement dead in its tracks. It became impossible to write even
remotely like this in Australia for 20 years.
But what is really interesting in the affair is the poems themselves.
Hayward prints all of them and they can be clearly seen as far from simple
pastiche or parody or even, indeed, as completely meaningless. They are
quirky, witty and evocative, daring even the reader who knows all about
their creation to dismiss them entirely. They have attracted quite a cult
following and have been reprinted a number of times, most recently in 1991
in a Penguin anthology of modern Australian verse.
Harris's supporters, beginning with Herbert Read, who bravely said that he
too would have been taken in, have maintained that the hoaxers builded
better than they knew; that being genuine poets and allowing themselves to
free-associate they justified the tenets of surrealism by producing true
poetry. There may be something in this, though it is pretty clear that the
authors were in full conscious control of their material.
Whatever one's views on the merits of the poetry, the affair is undoubtedly
fascinating. Perhaps it forms a test case for structuralists and others who
regard authorship as irrelevant in evaluating a text. Or perhaps it simply
justifies George Melly's view that true surrealists always attract surreal
events.
