So you want to be an actor? Go for it. But first take a look at the statistics 
in the current issue of the Actors' Equity newsletter, Equity News. 
</P>
<P>
"EMPLOYMENT CONTINUES STRONG UPSWING" is the headline. That sounds hopeful, and 
the figures do show that members worked a total of 233,540 weeks during the 
1988-89 theater season -- the highest in the union's history. 
</P>
<P>
They also show that: 
</P>
<P>
* Only 38% of the union's 36,481 members worked at all during the year. Twenty 
years ago, when Equity had only $14,504 members, 69% of them found at least one 
job during the season. 
</P>
<P>
* They worked only an average of 17 weeks. (A little better than the 1968-69 
figure: 16.2 weeks.) 
</P>
<P>
* Their average annual salary was only $9,858. (In 1968-69, it was $3,699.) 
</P>
<P>
For comparison, the U.S. government pegs the poverty level for individuals at 
$5,778 -- for families at $11,611. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to act, learn to type.

EBENEEZER, THOU HAST CONQUERED. As usual, "A Christmas Carol" wins the holiday 
play derby. American Theatre magazine's December issue lists 25 resident 
theater productions of Dickens' story from Maine to California, either in the 
original or in an update such as Ed Graczyk's "A Country Christmas Carol" (the 
Players Theater, Columbus, Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
Way back in the pack come O'Henry's "Gift of the Magi," Dylan Thomas' "A 
Child's Christmas in Wales," Truman Capote's "A Christmas Memory" and Thornton 
Wilder's "The Long Christmas Dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Fairy tales turn up in Milwaukee ("The Snow Queen," Milwaukee Repertory 
Theatre) and Minneapolis ("Cinderella," Minnesota Children's Theatre). Chapel 
Hill, N.C., will see a non-musical version of "The Nutcracker" (PlayMakers 
Repertory Company). San Francisco's Eureka Theatre will do "Little Nemo in 
Slumberland," based on the old Little Nemo comic strip. 
</P>
<P>
A few theaters will also remember whose birthday it is. El Teatro Campesino's 
production of "La Pastorela" at San Juan Bautista shows the Holy Family trying 
to find lodgings. Romulus Linney's "Sand Mountain" (Attic Theatre, Detroit) 
shows Jesus returning to Earth to share a jug with a mountain family. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Indiana Repertory Theatre is offering something called "Christmas 
With Bernadette." Hm. 
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D.-Vermont) on the recent National Endowment for 
the Arts controversy: "The issue that nobody wants to talk about is that some 
day, if you vote to protect the NEA, somebody is going to run that 30-second 
spot and say: 'Sen. So-and-So supports pornography.' "
