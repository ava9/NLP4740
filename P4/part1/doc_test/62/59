Maybe Johnny can't read. But Dylan can. So can James and Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
So when the call went out in November, those three -- along with 800 or so of 
their Carpenter Avenue School mates -- were ready to put their skills to work. 
Their task: to read as much as they could in a seven-week "read-a-thon." 
</P>
<P>
Squeezing a quarter or two out of mom and dad for every book they read, the 
children at the Studio City school brought in more than $9,000. World Book, the 
encyclopedia publishers, chipped in $6,000, bringing the total to $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
That money was used to buy more books: 17 new 22-volume sets of encyclopedias. 
Those new sets mean each of Carpenter's 27 classrooms has its own, something a 
World Book official said no other school in the nation can claim. 
</P>
<P>
The encyclopedia company runs similar "read-a-thons" at schools across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
New encyclopedias may not be on every third-grader's top 10 list of nifty 
stuff, but at an awards ceremony Friday, the kids at Carpenter seemed to take 
pride in their sets. After all, they earned them. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an incredible thing that you've done," Claude Swonger, district manager 
for World Book, told the semicircle of schoolchildren who sat cross-legged on 
the blacktop. "You were the ones who put your noses between the pages and 
read." 
</P>
<P>
And in the process, the children said they found that reading was kind of fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I like stuff in space and in stars," said third-grader Boyd Cooper, whose 
friends call him B.J. "My favorite planet is Saturn. I like to read about 
Saturn." 
</P>
<P>
As far as the encyclopedias went, Cooper said he could use them to look up 
information about gems and coins, two things he's developed an interest in 
lately. 
</P>
<P>
The encyclopedias already have come in handy. Teacher Wendy Raksin said her 
class looked up the entry on Braille after a question came up during a story 
about how dogs help the blind. 
</P>
<P>
Dylan Sculley, 9, finished off 10 books in seven weeks. Among his favorites was 
a book detailing the process of milk production. You know, how milk is 
pasteurized and "homogized" after it comes out of the cow. 
</P>
<P>
His friend, 8-year-old James Duffey, said he read 16 books, most of them about 
whales. But his reading skill was not what James wanted the world to know about 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I eat parts of my shoe," he said, shoving a piece of white rubber into his 
mouth.
