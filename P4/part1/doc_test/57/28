FT  28 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Unfancied Saudis still confident
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Holland, a team full of stars, were mightily fancied. Saudi Arabia,
contesting their first World Cup finals, were not.
Yet with two Group F matches remaining - Morocco vs Holland and Belgium vs
the Saudis, both tomorrow - Saudi Arabia may have a fractionally better
chance than Holland of making the second round.
Belgium leads the group with six points. Holland and the Saudis have three
each, and the same goal difference. But the Saudis lead Holland on goals
scored by three to two.
Saudi mid-fielder Fuad Amin predicts that his team will beat the Belgians.
'We're going to win,' said Amin, who scored the winner in Saturday's 2-1
victory over Morocco and the team's only goal in their 2-1 defeat by
Holland.
'We represent Saudi soccer and the whole Arab world. God willing, the next
game will be a great victory.'
A draw against the Saudis would clinch first place in Group F for Belgium,
but their coach, Paul Van Himst, said the team would be playing to win.
