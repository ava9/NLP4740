frontiers - European Trends

THE UK's vehicle leasing industry is the EC's most developed and
sophisticated by a significant degree, so the advent of the single market in
Europe presents unparalleled opportunities.
The removal of trade barriers should lead to a growth in business and
leisure travel and an increase in the pan-European movement of labour.
According to Mr Freddie Aldous, president of the European Car and Truck
Rental Association, 'for British-based leasing companies, the single market
offers a rich prize: wider markets, increased flexibility and a host of new
opportunities.'
However, the UK's leasing and contract hire specialists will not be storming
Europe overnight; and any forays into Europe are likely to be careful and
slow. The reason is that, despite the best efforts of the EC Commissioners,
each individual European market retains its own specific characteristics -
and, perhaps more importantly, its own fiscal regimes.
British companies cannot go blundering into France or Spain and expect to
run a vehicle leasing operation on the same lines as their home-based
business; so growth in Europe is most likely to come about as a result of
joint ventures with a local business that fully understands the local
marketplace.
That is the view of Mr Norman Donkin, chairman of AT&amp;T Norfolk Finance. 'In
the fullness of time we plan to expand into Europe, though how has still to
be determined. But we also need to be cautious. So I think the route would
be either to acquire a well-founded company or to go into partnership with
one. The last thing we would do is set up alone and in isolation.'
Though Britain has the lead in contract hire, it is not Europe's largest
business car market. Germany is at the top of the tree as far as numbers are
concerned with a business car parc (population) of almost 4m units. The more
sophisticated European markets - France, Belgium, Holland and Italy - are
all experiencing strong growth in contract hire.
In Germany, most company car business used to be undertaken by finance
lease. However, companies are now moving away from purchasing vehicles
towards contract hire, which is known as 'kilometre leasing'.
France, which calls its contract hire location longue duree, has seen its
leasing business dominated by the home-based manufacturers in the past. So
far, the big three - Renault, Peugeot and Citroen - have kept the
independent contract hire operators at bay.
Italy, too, was once almost wholly dominated by its major domestic
manufacturer, Fiat, but other companies such as VAG, Peugeot and Opel are
making inroads. Finance leasing is a popular means of acquisition but full
contract hire is still relatively small business.
It is even smaller business in Spain, where the current tax regime means it
is cheaper for the employee if the car is bought by the company rather than
leased; as a result contract hire has only a tiny percentage of the market.
Holland is a relatively mature market as far as contract hire goes but its
customers are traditionally geared towards price only.
'Quality of service and customer loyalty are not high on the list of
priorities,' comments Mr Neil Pykett, managing director of Cowie
Interleasing. He predicts that UK contract hire operators may see Germany
and France as likely markets in which to expand in the near future.
However, the single market for vehicle leasing will not achieve its
potential until full tax harmonisation becomes a reality rather than a myth,
says Mr Ron Elder, managing director of Avis Lease and Fleet Management.
'Each EC member state still operates its own tax jurisdiction regulating
VAT, excise duties, benefit-in-kind and ad hoc car taxes. All of these
affect the attractiveness and suitability of the range of lease products on
the market compared with other means of acquiring vehicles. National
governments also retain control of domestic interest rate structures which
impact local lease rates.
'Add these to national variations in car delivery costs, maintenance costs
and residual values and the estimated time of arrival of true pan-European
leasing is somewhere at the end of the decade,' he predicts.
But despite the variables, he does discern one trend: a marked shift in
Europe away from purchasing vehicles in favour of leasing or contract hire.
'It will account for around a third of the market by the year 2000, compared
with a current market share of 21 per cent,' says Mr Elder though he warns:
'But once again, the lack of true harmonisation within the EC may serve to
stifle the development of one of the most advanced leasing products
available.'
