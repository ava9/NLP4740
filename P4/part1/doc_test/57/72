FT  09 OCT 93 / Pirate cards breach Sky defences

THE Financial Times yesterday obtained in the UK an unauthorised 'smart
card' to unscramble British Sky Broadcasting subscription channels such as
Sky Movies and Sky Sports.
The card arrived by post, with a Cheshire postmark, from Satellite Decoder
Systems of Warrington, a branch of an Irish business run by Mr David Lyons.
The card worked perfectly and produced pictures that were indistinguishable
from the 'real' thing - except that the pirate card produced the unscrambled
pictures more quickly, probably because the authorisation process had been
circumvented.
SDS said yesterday, after meeting with trading standards officers in
Cheshire, that it would continue to export the cards to the UK from Ireland.
Mr Geoff Holland, Cheshire's principal trading standards officer, said it
was illegal to import the cards and that if the importing was done directly
by customers they would be breaking the law.
He also made it clear that it was illegal under the 1990 Broadcasting Act to
use the unauthorised cards in the UK if, in doing so, the user intended to
avoid paying for the channel he was watching. Mr Holland said he would
examine the legal position on advertising and suggested that SDS
advertisements might breach the advertising code.
Mr Lyons said yesterday that SDS would contest a writ from BSkyB imposing a
restraining order on SDS carrying out any activities laid down as illegal
under the copyright laws. The satellite company, in which Pearson, publisher
of the FT, has a stake, will also seek damages.
Mr Lyons said: 'We contest that we have done none of the things they are
trying to take action on. All we have done is advertise in the UK.'
In the meantime SDS is continuing to challenge the ability of BSkyB's
engineers to neutralise its cards. 'Sky is running out of things to do,'
said Mr Lyons. 'We know all the information in their chip and if they call
their card in we already have the information they will be using on their
next card.'
The Motion Picture Export Association of America had already drawn up
proposals on the growing problem of unauthorised satellite cards across
Europe to submit to the European Commission for action.
