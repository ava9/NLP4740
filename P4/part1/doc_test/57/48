SHADOWS AND FOG (15) Woody Allen
OLIVIER OLIVIER (15) Agnieszka Holland
THE LIVING END (18) Gregg Araki
STAY TUNED (PG) Peter Hyams
Woody Allen's deliciously strange Shadows And Fog is about the Known and the
Unknowable. Part tragedy, part comedy; part human puppet-show, part
charabanc tour through the dark night of the soul; it is a fantasy prelude
in film noir tones to the later Husbands And Wives.
In America many hated it: mainly because there are so many plots bubbling at
once that it is like being in a mad wizard's kitchen. We have Allen himself
as Mr Kleinman, the bumbling coward roped into a posse hunting a mass killer
in a European town. We have circus sword-swallower Mia Farrow, flouncing out
on husband John Malkovich after he has slept with trapeze artist Madonna. We
have the star-packed brothel (Kathy Bates, Lily Tomlin, Jodie Foster) where
Farrow spends a fugitive night. We have Farrow-smitten student John Cusack;
mad doctor Donald Pleasence; neighbour Kate Nelligan . . .
Whoah. Enough, you cry. How many films are being reviewed here under one
title? But the multi-story skittishness of Shadows And Fog is its charm. If
Husbands And Wives gave us the first great film from a new, free-associating
Woody - conventional style and structure splintering under the power of
improvised emotion - Shadows And Fog is like a gentler dressage for that
drama of deconstruction.
Across the dinky squares, through the picture-book fog and darkness, lope
the funny-mysterious Lilliputians. In style the film is a toy-theatre spoof
on German Expressionism, doing for Lang and Murnau what Love And Death did
for Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. But Shadows And Fog is also about good and evil,
destiny and predestination. Herr Kleinman - Allen with specs and nervous
soliloquies - knows he has been 'chosen' but cannot figure out what for.
Farrow's runaway circus girl leaps into her fated midnight and finds a fated
self-fulfilment. (She links up with Allen in what may be their last and most
touching boy-meets-girl vignette.) And Doc Pleasence, pondering a morgueful
of corpses, gazes straight and steely-eyed into the heart of life, death and
the beyond.
Though Carlo Di Palma's black-and-white photography mimics a gloom-laden
cine-Europe of 60 years ago, the film is also free-spirited enough to throw
in some prime Woody repartee. (Farrow: 'I slept with one man for money. Does
that make me a whore?' Allen: 'Only by the dictionary definition.') And a
classically deft scene of romantic misunderstanding between Cusack and
Malkovich shows that the director does not save all the good laughs for
himself.
But Shadows And Fog is best when comedy balances on a knife-edge of the
macabre; when the inquisitive despair that Allen over-formalised in his
Chekhov-Bergman pieces (Interiors, September) is given the true texture of
filmic malaise - human fear and defiance glittering in the shadows of the
unknowable.
When a film comes to a sudden narrative pause and flashes up the title
'Paris, six years later,' we fear the worst. Either the characters who were
children will have grown up to become unrecognisable adults. Or those who
were grown-ups will be the same actors with a wisp of grey hair and a look
of telegraphic disenchantment.
But Agnieszka Holland's powerfully imaginative Olivier Olivier skips over
every lurking trap. In part one nine-year-old Olivier disappears from his
rural home - never seen again after leaving to take food to Granny (yes,
shades of Red Riding Hood) - and parents Francois Cluzet and Brigitte Rouan
are split apart by sobs and recriminations. In part two 15-year-old Olivier
is tracked down by Paris cop Jean-Francois Stevenin and restored to his
ecstatic parents and startled sister.
But is it Olivier? The questionable resemblance of new actor to old has the
audience clucking scornful scepticism: only to be out-clucked by the movie
itself as it sows doubts in the midst of delight and then delivers a
knock-out denouement.
Taken from a newspaper item, the story grows its own reality like a cutting
newly planted in rich soil. One-time co-screenwriter with Wajda (Man Of
Iron, Danton), Agnieszka Holland has learned the art of
more-comes-from-less. The film never stops to 'explain' its characters. The
stormy father, the besotted mother; the enigmatic sister with her
sacrificial rites and mystic powers (from self-inflicted cigarette burns to
telekinesis); the teenage Olivier's moody inconsistency of recall. The
characters are 'givens' who create their own human weather system, as alien
and yet as recognisable as the sirocco. And domestic trivia, from a
squalling cat to the musical beds of sleepless children climbing in with
sighing adults, become the meteorology of changing emotion.
Gregg Araki's The Living End is an AIDS-era road movie and as dotty as that
sounds. Two HIV-positive Californians, bookish Jon and hellraising Luke,
throw themselves into each other's arms and then onto the open road in this
film that resembles a cross between a gay Badlands and a Wild At Heart for
sexual militants. Casual murders; lots of outlaw lyricism; and a sense of
two people narcissistically narrating their own lives as they glide
attitudinisingly towards death.
Jon (Craig Gilmore) is a film critic writing a thesis on the 'Death of
Cinema'. (No comment.) Luke is a drama queen with bronzed pectorals who
wants to blow his brains out during a final dazzling orgasm. When not giving
screen time to these tinpot tragic heroes, debut director Araki branches out
into caricatured women. These range from two loudmouthed lesbians scripted
for penis-envy dialogue to a Bette Davis lookalike with pillbox hat and
kitchen knife. This last floats into an early love scene between Luke and a
pick-up, delivers the line 'This isn't the Seventies any more, you know' and
stabs the pick-up to death.
Reality? Fantasy? Comedy? Horror? Who knows. Who, alas, cares. Mark this
down as the first, worst film of a director who may improve when he empties
his system of gay special pleading and camp melodramatics.
Stay Tuned is, if possible, worse. Married couple John Ritter and Pam
Dawber, Faustians of the hi-fi age, have adventures in a nightmare TV-land
run by Satan figure Jeffrey Jones. Sucked into this 'other world' via a
giant satellite dish, they become actors in spoof shows like The Golden
Ghouls, Meet The Mansons and Northern Overexposure.
The cod titles are the funniest thing. Elsewhere this is fast, frenetic,
fun-free tripe: scripted by ex-advertising duo Tom Parker and Jim Jenewein
and directed by Peter Hyams.
To conjure the true spirit of comedy this week requires necromancy. The late
Buster Keaton, greatest of silent comics, unlocks his stone-faced splendour
in a season at the Barbican. Sherlock Junior is joined by two classic
shorts, The Love Nest and The Playhouse, in a programme no connoisseur of
mute mirth should miss. (But be warned: the odd sound effect has been added
to Sherlock).
The opposite of a comedian who never speaks is a film-maker whose characters
never shut up. A sad farewell to Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who died last Friday.
He spent his life wiring great film stars for sound, plugging them in and
then standing back to watch the mixture of noise, sparks and explosions. He
twinned Brando and Gielgud in Julius Caesar. He set Olivier and Caine at
each other's larynxes in Sleuth. And in All About Eve, starring Bette Davis
and a famous line about bumpy nights, he made the most glorious impostor
among movies. It pretends to be a film; it is really a stage play with a
camera breathing down its neck. But who objects? No movie ever matched its
glittering, sideswiping dialogue or its showman's wisdom about show
business.
