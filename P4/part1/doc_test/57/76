  [Text] Yokosuka, Kanagawa Pref., April 11 KYODO -- The 
reactors of two U.S. nuclear-powered attack submarines may have 
had repair work done in Japan in January in spite of a bilateral 
agreement ruling out such activities, an anti-U.S. base citizens 
group said Monday [11 April]. 
  The Holland, a 10,500-ton U.S. tender for nuclear-powered 
submarines, called at the U.S. Yokosuka Naval Base in Yokosuka, 
Kanagawa Prefecture, for about a month from January 11, 
according to the citizens group, the National Environmental 
Policy Act (NEPA) coalition of Japan. 
  During the period, two U.S. nuclear-powered attack 
submarines 
-- the Tunny and the New York City -- also stopped at the base, 
group members said. 
  The group said base employees witnessed in mid-January 
several repair engineers from the Holland enter into reactor and 
weapons zones within the submarines. The zones are off-limits 
to Japanese. 
  The group members said the tender and the submarines stopped 
at the base at the same time apparently because the war ships' 
reactors needed repairs. The Holland was designed to provide 
repair and supply services for submarines. 
  A memorandum between Japan and the U.S. stipulates that 
power 
equipment of U.S. submarines will not be repaired in Japan. 
  A U.S. Navy commander in Japan said that the Holland 
conducted "a routine port visit in conjunction with her current 
deployment to the western Pacific." 
  Yokosuka city officials said that based on the Japan-U.S. 
memorandum it does not believe nuclear-related repair work was 
done. 
  Shoji Shimizu, leader of the NEPA coalition, said the port 
call by the Holland may indicate future plans to have U.S. 
submarines repaired in Yokosuka.
