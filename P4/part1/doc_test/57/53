Dan-Air, in conjunction with Air U.K., is offering a "Visit U.K." fare that 
allows travelers to fly to any point that the airlines serve on their combined 
route systems in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
The first one-way flight costs $75 U.S. (up from $66 in 1988). Each additional 
one-way flight costs $55, up from $49. Discounts are 26% to 40% from regular 
point-to-point economy fares. 
</P>
<P>
The "Visit U.K." fare is only available with a transatlantic flight, on any 
airline, to the United Kingdom. Bookings must be made through travel agents. 
</P>
<P>
Reservations for the first flight have to be made before departure from the 
United States. Tickets for additional flights must be issued in the United 
States, but they can be open-dated and reservations can be made for specific 
dates. 
</P>
<P>
There is no minimum-stay requirement, but the maximum stay is 30 days. The 
special fares are available through March 31, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Cities served include London, Manchester, Bournemouth, Leeds/Bradford, 
Newcastle, Exeter, Norwich, Southampton and Humberside in England; Cardiff, 
Wales; Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Inverness in Scotland; Belfast, 
Northern Ireland, and the islands of Guernsey and Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
For example, travelers can fly from London to Edinburgh for $75, travel through 
Scotland, then fly back to London from Glasgow for $55. 
</P>
<P>
Refunds are available, minus a $20 fee. Once reservations are made, it costs 
$25 to make an itinerary change.
