THE US, Britain and France have hinted strongly that further military action
may be taken against Iraq if it fails to comply with United Nations
resolutions requiring the scrapping of its weapons of mass destruction,
The Gulf war allies also hope they can topple Mr Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi
president, by harnessing domestic discontent with his regime.
Yesterday, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, underlined
mounting frustration with Iraq's prevarication over meeting UN ceasefire
terms, saying: 'We do not rule out going back to military action.'
His remarks follow those on Saturday by Mr Thomas Pickering of the US, who
read a statement in the name of the Security Council's 15 members warning
that Iraq 'must be aware of the serious consequences of continued material
breaches of' UN orders.
Iraq announced yesterday that a delegation being sent to the UN would be
headed by Mr Tariq Aziz, the deputy prime minister. He is expected to try to
avert a potentially serious clash over Iraq's latest defiance of the UN.
The US wants Iraq's delegation to go to New York by March 9. It has hinted
military action may follow if Baghdad fails to comply with UN resolutions.
The US still has 25 ships, including two aircraft carriers, in the Gulf and
more than 200 combat aircraft in the region.
The confrontation with Iraq flared over its refusal on Friday to follow
orders from the latest UN team of ballistics experts to destroy
manufacturing equipment for Scud missiles. The UN team left Baghdad in
protest on Saturday and is in Bahrain preparing a report for the UN
commission charged with overseeing destruction of Iraq's weapons.
Mr Christopher Holland, the Briton leading the ballistics team, said his
mission had been 'very successful' in finding equipment used in
manufacturing Iraq's long-range missiles, but Iraqi officials refused to
destroy machines they had identified.
Although Mr Holland declined to give details of Iraqi missile equipment, he
said it included machines 'specifically identified with the production of
missiles with ranges more than 150km'. Iraqi officials claimed the
technology had civilian uses, but Mr Holland said there was no doubt the
equipment formed a key production line for Iraq's missile programme.
Britain and France are pushing for a new Security Council resolution
instructing Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, to send a
special envoy to examine the political situation in northern and southern
Iraq. They hope an inquiry will focus grievances and help destabilise the
government.
The US, while generally sympathetic, has not yet committed itself to this
idea, fearing that any side-issue might help Mr Saddam avoid giving a
straight answer about his weapons programmes.
