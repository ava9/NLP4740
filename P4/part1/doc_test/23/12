  [Text] Vienna, June 7 KYODO -- North Korea will "never" 
allow special international inspections of its two undeclared 
nuclear facilities suspected to be part of a secret nuclear arms 
development program, a North Korean diplomat said Tuesday [7 
June]. 
  Yun Ho-chin, North Korean delegate to the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna, criticized a recent IAEA 
report which said Pyongyang has made it impossible to determine 
whether plutonium has been diverted for nuclear weapons. 
  Yun, meeting reporters at the IAEA headquarters, said the 
nuclear watchdog can carry out satisfactory inspections by 
checking fuel rods removed from a 5-megawatt reactor in the 
Yongbyon nuclear complex 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang. 
  His remarks came at a time when an IAEA Board of Governors 
meeting was in session and likely to demand that North Korea 
accept inspections of the two sites as a possible alternative 
means of finding out if it has been developing nuclear arms. 
  Meanwhile, North Korea sent a letter to the IAEA on Monday, 
suggesting it may withdraw from the nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty if the U.N. agency continues putting pressure on 
Pyongyang over the issue. 
  North Korea had rejected the IAEA's demands to stop removing 
fuel rods from the reactor, which the nuclear watchdog said 
would spoil chances to determine if plutonium had been secretly 
taken from the rods to manufacture nuclear weapons.
