Talks between North Korea and the US on Pyongyang's nuclear programme
appeared to move forward yesterday when Pyongyang said it was willing to
transform its nuclear power industry, Reuter reports from Geneva.
Mr Kang Sok-chu, North Korea's deputy foreign minister, said Pyongyang had
offered to switch from its plutonium-producing graphite reactors to safer
light-water reactors. was
But North Korea was only willing to make the switch if it received 'proper
and appropriate compensation', suggesting there would be a high price for
ending the stand-off caused by North Korea's refusal to allow full
inspections of its nuclear facilities.
Mr Robert Gallucci, US assistant secretary of state and chief American
delegate at the talks, said North Korea's offers had come in response to US
proposals considered by Pyongyang over the weekend. The suggestions were
'certainly worthy of study and consideration' before tomorrow's meeting.
Resumption of the Geneva talks follows the death four weeks ago of Kim
Il-sung, the North Korean leader. The new session has been seen in the west
as an important pointer to the stance taken by his son and successor, Mr Kim
Jong-il.
Mr Kang also said North Korea had proposed ways to tackle the problem of
8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods removed from a reactor in May which would
'certainly ease the concerns of the international community'. The US and
South Korea have expressed fears the North could reprocess the fuel rods and
gain a potential supply of plutonium for making nuclear weapons.
The US has been trying to persuade Pyongyang to open its nuclear power
programme to full international inspection, accusing it of having diverted
plutonium for nuclear weapons manufacture. Under a plan thought to be
favoured by the US, any light-water reactors given to North Korea would
probably be Russian, since the North Koreans already know Russian
technology.
