The North Korean nuclear issue may be referred by the US and South Korea
soon to the United Nations Security Council for punitive action, following
Pyongyang's refusal to allow international inspectors to examine fuel rods
being withdrawn from its nuclear reactor. The International Atomic Energy
Agency reported at the weekend that negotiations with North Korea on the
inspection of fuel rods had broken down, with Pyongyang continuing to remove
them in spite of IAEA protests.
The IAEA wants to analyse the rods to determine whether North Korea has
previously diverted plutonium produced by the 5MW reactor for its suspected
nuclear weapons programme.
But North Korea refused all IAEA proposals to secure some of the 8,000 fuel
rods to verify that the reactor core is the original installed in 1986. The
reactor was shut down for 100 days in 1989, leading to speculation that
North Korea removed some of the plutonium-rich fuel rods to make nuclear
devices.
The US and South Korea have warned that if inspection is blocked, they would
ask the UN for economic sanctions on North Korea. Pyongyang has said this
would be 'an act of war'.
There is a faint hope the issue could be resolved, since two IAEA inspectors
remain at the North's Yongbyon nuclear complex to supervise the rods'
removal, which is half completed.
North Korea said it would not comply with the IAEA's demand concerning the
fuel rods since it claimed a 'unique status', referring to its move to
withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty a year ago.
