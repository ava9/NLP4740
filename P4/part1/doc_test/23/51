  [Text] According to a Chinese source on 21 January, North 
Korea has been secretly extracting a considerable amount of 
plutonium while it held nuclear negotiations with the United 
States, and that it is highly possible that North Korea has 
already produced a small nuclear bomb and is hiding it in an 
underground warehouse. 
  This source well versed in North Korean affairs said: ``I 
recently heard from a senior North Korean official that North 
Korea is hiding nuclear weapons in an underground warehouse in 
the mountains near Pyongyang and that any thorough inspection of 
North Korean nuclear facilities [haek sisol] by the United 
States and the International Atomic Energy Agency will fail to 
locate them.''
