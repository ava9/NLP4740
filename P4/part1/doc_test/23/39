<F P=106> [John Burton report: "North Korea in Nuclear Warning to </F>
Tokyo"] 
  [Text] A North Korean official warned yesterday that if his 
country was to develop nuclear weapons, they would be primarily 
aimed at Japan, rather than at South Korea or the US. 
  The warning, one of the most explicit made by North Korea 
about the intent of its possible nuclear weapons programme, is 
likely to heighten concern in Tokyo that Pyongyang poses a 
serious military challenge. However, North Korean officials 
claim they suspect Japan's nuclear motives, and the statement 
yesterday came a day after the start-up of Japan's first 
fastbreeder nuclear reactor, which began a self-sustaining chain 
reaction. 
  Mr Cha Bongju, the North Korean ambassador to India, again 
said his country did not intend to develop nuclear weapons, but 
told the South Korean news agency YONHAP the North feared that 
Japan would eventually become a nuclear power. 
  "Our nuclear arms, if developed, would be primarily designed 
to contain Japan," Mr Cha said. 
  He added that a North Korean nuclear weapon would never be 
used against South Korea or the US. 
  The statements could increase pressure on the Japanese 
government to take a tougher line against North Korea over the 
issue of nuclear site inspections. They will also provide 
support for Japanese officials arguing that the country must 
boost its defence capability. 
  North Korea has already developed a missile, the Rodong-I 
[Nodong-1], that can reach most of Japan, although military 
analysts believe that Pyongyang does not yet have the capability 
of building a sophisticated nuclear warhead small enough to fit 
on the missile. 
  But the ambassador's comments appear to confirm some 
analysts' fears that North Korea might use the Japanese 
fast-breeder reactor, which generates plutonium, as a pretext 
for proceeding with its own production of plutonium, used in the 
making of nuclear weapons. 
  It was the second North Korean warning this week that it 
might be ready to resume plutonium production. 
  Some analysts in Seoul believe Mr Cha's comments might be an 
attempt to allay South Korea's fears about the development of a 
North Korean nuclear weapon by appealing to the traditional 
Korean dislike of Japan. 
  North Korea has come under growing pressure to open up its 
nuclear facilities to full international nuclear inspections to 
dispel suspicions that it is developing nuclear weapons. 
  Pyongyang rejected a request by the UN Security Council last 
week that it accept new inspections of nuclear sites by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency.
