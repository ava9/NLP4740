The possibility that Mr Kim Jong-il, son of the late President Kim Il-sung,
will be named North Korean president and head of the ruling party next week
after the 100-day mourning for his father may remove uncertainty over the
extent of the new leader's control in Pyongyang.
Statements by North Korean officials referring to Mr Kim as the 'supreme
leader' led diplomats to believe a turning point may soon be reached in
nuclear talks between the US and North Korea, which resumed at high level in
Geneva on Wednesday after a five-day break.
'With no one in confident overall command, it is most unlikely North Korean
officials would take responsibility for reaching agreement,' said a western
diplomat. 'To have a properly appointed leader must be a step forward.'
Diplomats expressed caution over Mr Kim's influence on the talks, saying it
was impossible to predict whether he would take the same hard line as his
father or a more conciliatory one. Negotiations centre on an international
aid package to switch North Korea's nuclear programme from
graphite-moderated reactors to safer light-water versions.
In a preliminary accord reached on August 12, Pyongyang agreed to freeze its
nuclear programme in return for light-water technology and diplomatic ties
with Washington. But, in talks since then, North Korean officials have put
up a series of new demands which Washington calls unacceptable.
The talks have been consistently described as 'serious and businesslike' by
both sides, but many observers fear North Korea is simply seeking to gain
time to pursue its nuclear ambitions and stave off economic sanctions.
Reports from Washington say the Clinton administration has decided not to
give ground to Pyongyang but to maintain its August offer and hope this will
eventually be accepted. With American forces engaged in Haiti and mid-term
elections next month, the US has no interest in precipitating a
confrontation.
AlThough North Korea denies a nuclear weapons programme, it continues to
refuse access to two suspected nuclear waste sites at the Yongbyon nuclear
complex. The International Atomic Energy Agency believes inspection of these
sites could provide clues to what has happened to plutonium missing from an
experimental 5MW nuclear reactor.
In last week's Geneva talks Mr Kang Sok-ju, North Korea's first deputy
foreign minister, apparently rejected even a rough timetable for such
inspections which the US insists must be part of any final deal.
Other unresolved issues concern the roughly 8,000 spent reactor-fuel rods in
a holding pond at Yongbyon which the US wants shipped out of the country,
and North Korea's demands for cash compensation for ending its
graphite-moderated reactor programme.
