The US and North Korea will resume high-level talks in Geneva today on full
inspections of Pyongyang's nuclear programme in return for possible US
diplomatic ties and economic aid. However, new uncertainties will cloud the
negotiations, , suspended on July 8 after only one day because of the death
of North Korea's President Kim Il-sung.
The main question is whether North Korea has changed its basic policy on the
nuclear issue under its new leader, Mr Kim Jong-il, the late president's
son. The talks are expected provide the first significant indication of Mr
Kim's willingness to solve the nuclear dispute and proceed with economic
reforms opening the country to foreign investment.
'Our policy remains consistent,' said Mr Ho Jong, former North Korean
ambassador to the United Nations and a member of the Geneva delegation led
by Mr Kang Sok-ju, the first vice foreign minister. But there is still
concern that Mr Kim may adopt a hard line in order to win the backing of
military for his assumption of power which has not yet been completed.
Moreover, the one month delay in the talks occasioned by the president's
death has increased pressure to find a quick solution. North Korea has
threatened to start reprocessing spent nuclear fuel into weapons-grade
plutonium at the end of the month if an accord is not achieved soon.
Pyongyang claims that the spent fuel rods, which are being stored in a
cooling tank under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy
Agency, must be reprocessed soon for safety reasons.
But the reprocessing of the fuel, which could produce plutonium for four or
five nuclear bombs, would break North Korea's promise to freeze its nuclear
activities. The US has threatened to break off the talks in response and
seek UN economic sanctions, an action Pyongyang has said amounts to an act
of war.
The US has disputed the urgency of reprocessing the spent fuel rods,
believing that North Korea is using the issue as a negotiating tactic.
Mr Robert Gallucci, US assistant secretary of state and chief US delegate at
the Geneva talks, said: 'The first order of business for us with the (North
Korean) representatives on Friday will be to address that issue of time and
push it aside for a number of months.'
The US has suggested that North Korea transport the nuclear fuel to a third
country for processing, but Pyongyang opposes the idea.
Washington appears willing to grant several concessions to North Korea if it
agrees to full nuclear inspections. These could include the establishment of
liaison offices as a first step to full diplomatic relations, which
Pyongyang regards as a guarantee of US non-aggression. It has also suggested
that it would support the replacement of North Korea's plutonium-producing
graphite reactors with safer light water ones that would be supplied by
Russia, Japan or South Korea at a cost of at least Dollars 1bn.
Several other problems remain in concluding a comprehensive agreement,
including procedural issues on how actions by both sides would be
co-ordinated.
North Korea is also refusing a demand by the International Atomic Energy
Agency to be allowed to make special inspections of two suspected nuclear
waste dump sites to determine if Pyongyang has previously withdrawn
plutonium from its 5MW reactor to make at least one nuclear bomb.
The US has stipulated that North Korea must accept the special inspections
in return for concessions. The IAEA request triggered the nuclear dispute 16
months ago, prompting North Korea to threaten to withdraw from the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty.
Another potential source of trouble is the expected US insistence that
diplomatic ties between Washington and Pyongyang be linked to progress on
relations between North and South Korea. A proposed summit between the two
Koreas was postponed following President Kim's death and tensions have
increased in recent weeks as the two countries have engaged in a fierce
propaganda war.
The linkage between North-South Korean relations and US-North Korea ties is
meant to prevent Pyongyang from using the nuclear issue to drive a wedge
between Washington and Seoul over the future defence of South Korea.
Pyongyang has repeatedly claimed that the solution to the nuclear dispute
lies in an agreement with the US, since it regards South Korea as being an
American 'puppet state'.
