  [Text] Vienna, March 10 KYODO -- Inspections of North 
Korean nuclear facilities, suspected as part of a suspected 
nuclear arms development program, are not progressing according 
to schedule, sources at the International Atomic Energy Agency 
said Thursday [10 March]. 
  The sources said the inspections to ensure that North Korea 
has not been diverting nuclear fuel to military purposes may not 
be completed by March 14 or 15 as originally scheduled. 
  An IAEA official said the inspectors are not being denied 
access to North Korea's seven declared nuclear sites and that 
there is still time to complete the inspections, refusing to 
acknowledge a possible delay in their safeguards checks. 
  The sources, however, said North Korean officials have 
reportedly told inspectors that it is "not necessary" to check a 
certain number of sites before the nuclear experts have had a 
chance to look for themselves. 
  Diplomatic sources have suggested the lack of progress may 
have been influenced by the stalemate in inter-Korean 
working-level talks Wednesday on the exchange of presidential 
envoys. 
  Washington has already tied a third round of high-level 
talks 
with Pyongyang in Geneva on March 21 to the completion of the 
IAEA inspections and the dialogue on envoys. 
  The sources here suggested that if the inspections are 
delayed, the U.S.-North Korean talks will be placed in a 
delicate situation. 
  Further, if IAEA inspectors cannot ensure the continuity of 
the nuclear safeguards, the issue will likely be referred to the 
U.N. Security Council, which could call for sanctions against 
Pyongyang. 
  Meanwhile in Seoul, the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) 
reported that the inspectors have found some of the seals on 
equipment to ensure the nuclear safeguards may have been damaged. 
  The seals were among those in seven declared sites in 40 
locations. 
  However, there appeared to be nothing unusual on the seals 
on 
the 5,000-kilowatt reactor in the nuclear complex at Yongbyon, 
some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang, KBS reported quoting IAEA 
sources.
