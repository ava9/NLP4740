EFFORTS to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue will take several months
of 'painstaking negotiations,' Mr Han Sung-joo, the South Korean foreign
minister, said yesterday.
Mr Han cautioned that the process would be complicated because North Korea
must hold separate talks with the US, South Korea and the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on allowing full nuclear inspections.
The US will start talks with North Korea tomorrow in Geneva to persuade
Pyongyang to stay within the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) and
accept IAEA inspections of two nuclear waste facilities that could determine
whether North Korea is processing more plutonium than it has declared.
The US has also indicated that progress should be achieved in implementing
mutual nuclear inspections between North and South Korea before it is
willing to expand relations with Pyongyang.
North Korea has recently adopted a conciliatory attitude towards the US in
preparation for the talks, including toning down its anti-US rhetoric and
yesterday returning the remains of 17 UN soldiers killed during the Korean
War.
Pyongyang is sending a 'signal to Washington that it is interested in
improving relations,' explained Mr Han.
In contrast, US President Bill Clinton during his weekend visit to South
Korea appeared to toughen his stance against the North Korean nuclear
programme. Earlier he had offered concessions including allowing high-level
meetings between US and North Korean officials after Pyongyang threatened in
March to withdraw from the NPT. The talks in New York eventually persuaded
North Korea to suspend its NPT withdrawal last month.
The tougher US approach has the full backing of Seoul, according to Mr Han.
'We recognised that North Korea may have felt insecure and we tried to take
measures to allay the unnecessary fears that North Korea may have had,' he
explained about the first round of US-North Korean negotiations.
The sharper tone now being adopted was meant to emphasise to North Korea
that the nuclear issue 'is a very serious matter and must be resolved'.
The foreign minister denied there were any differences between the US and
South Korea on how to deal with the North Korean issue, explaining that
Seoul did not favour a more conciliatory approach than Washington.
He was 'neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the outcome' of this week's
US-North Korean talks. However Pyongyang had no choice but to accept nuclear
inspections because it wanted to avoid UN economic sanctions. 'I have no
doubt that sanctions are something North Korea does not want to be faced
with,' Mr Han said, referring to the country's difficult economic situation.
