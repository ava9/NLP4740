EFFORTS TO persuade North Korea to allow further nuclear inspections will be
stepped up today at a special board meeting of the International Atomic
Energy Agency in Vienna, writes David White, Defence Correspondent.
The meeting of the agency's 35 governors follows North Korea's announcement
last week of withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and
tension over the Team Spirit US-South Korean military exercises.
Mr Hans Blix, IAEA director-general, will report on North Korea's refusal
last month to allow inspection of two sites near its Yongbyon nuclear
complex. Evidence from earlier inspections raised suspicions that the
country might have separated more plutonium, usable for nuclear weapons,
than the tiny amount it has declared.
An IAEA official said a North Korean representative might attend the
meeting.
