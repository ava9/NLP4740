  [Text] Moscow, June 28 (YONHAP) -- A senior North Korean 
official admitted that his country possesses plutonium for 
research purposes at a radiochemical laboratory in the Yongbyon 
nuclear complex, ITAR-TASS News Agency reported from Pyongyang 
on Monday. 
  In an interview with the Russian news agency, the North 
Korean director general of the Atomic Energy Industry Ministry 
overseas affairs bureau, Choe Chong-sun, acknowledged that some 
plutonium was at the complex but did not elaborate on the total 
amount. 
  Choe is the first top North Korean official to admit to his 
country's possession of plutonium. He reportedly said that 
despite Pyongyang's withdrawal from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), the agency's monitoring equipment at 
Yongbyon is operating normally and stressed that North Korea 
will inform the IAEA if the equipment needs replacement. 
  As to cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog, Choe said 
North Korea has no specific expectations "at present as well as 
in the past," disclosing that only 500,000 U.S. dollars was 
provided by the agency last year for agricultural and medical 
purposes. 
  The basic purpose of the Yongbyon nuclear reactor, 
constructed through close cooperation with Russia, is to secure 
the nuclear power generation necessary to develop the country's 
economy, he asserted. The existing 5-megawatt reactor is 
insufficient to meet domestic demand. 
  Although the former Soviet Union provided key assistance in 
building the reactor, he continued, North Korea does not hold 
out much hope that its successor Russia will do the same. He 
maintained that "there is almost no cooperation with Russia 
presently in the nuclear field."
