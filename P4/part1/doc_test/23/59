<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Last Tricks of the North Korean Nuclear </F>
Issue"] 
  [Text] The North Korean nuclear issue approaches a crisis 
once again. This is because North Korea has begun changing fuel 
rods at its nuclear reactor by ignoring the International Atomic 
Energy Agency's [IAEA] request for safety steps regarding the 
replacement of fuel rods. 
  Such dogmatic behavior by North Korea is a challenge that 
will throw a wet blanket on efforts by the ROK, the United 
States, and the United Nations to peacefully settle the North 
Korean nuclear issue. Accordingly, the UN Security Council will 
give, sooner or later, a warning to North Korea in the name of 
its president or adopt a statement condemning North Korea 
regarding its replacement of fuel rods. Also, it will discuss 
sanctions against North Korea. Such being the situation, the 
government naturally convened a meeting of security-related 
ministers, defined the present situation as "a serious 
situation," and decided to hurry in preparing against North 
Korea's sudden action." 
  As soon as a third round of U.S.-North Korean talks seemed 
imminent, North Korea turned their back from the international 
community and suddenly began changing fuel rods at a 5-megawatt 
nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. The replacement of nuclear fuel 
rods is the last key to uncovering the suspected nuclear 
development by North Korea. This is because we can confirm if 
North Korea has extracted plutonium, the raw material for 
manufacturing nuclear weapons, from the spent fuel rods or 
converted it to manufacture nuclear bombs. Accordingly, the 
IAEA offered to analyze fuel rods after random selection and 
separate preservation to confirm North Korea's claims that the 
core rods [nosim] have not been removed since operations began 
in 1986, but North Korea rejected this by citing "their unique 
status" of having delayed their decision to withdraw from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It has been learned that North 
Korea has already removed and is now preserving approximately 
4,000 rods out of the 8,010 rods from the nuclear reactor. 
  We can point out several reasons why North Korea has begun 
replacing fuel rods despite the fact that they are well aware 
that international community would impose sanctions or pressure 
against them, and that they would face destruction: First, this 
is to hide the amount of plutonium they have so far extracted 
from the spent fuel rods; second, technologically, they could no 
longer put off the replacement of fuel rods; and third, this can 
be regarded as a strategy to gain something more from the United 
States during the third round of U.S.-North Korean high level 
talks. Neither can we overlook the fact that North Korea seems 
especially intent on acting this way in order to control their 
people, who are agitated over the serious food shortage or 
economic difficulties, by creating more tension on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  While recklessly taking a hardline attitude regarding the 
nuclear issue, North Korea has strongly insisted on holding 
talks with the United States. This is attracting people's 
attention. A spokesman of North Korean Foreign Ministry said on 
28 May that "the DPRK will make every effort to ultimately 
resolve the nuclear issue during talks with the United States." 
Also, the Korea Central News Agency stressed that the DPRK 
"will accept overall inspections [chonmyon sachal] of nuclear 
facilities in Yongbyon if the United States agrees to settlement 
of the nuclear issue through a package deal." 
  Anyway, we can no longer overlook North Korea's last game 
with fire regarding the nuclear issue. The government needs to 
clearly realize that there is a limit to our position regarding 
the principle of peacefully resolving the nuclear issue and of 
accepting North Korea as the same fellow men. It must assume a 
stern attitude to lead North Korea to suspend replacing fuel 
rods at the nuclear reactor and to accept the IAEA's request for 
safety in the cooperation with the friendly countries, including 
the United States. It is also important to take a strong 
position so that the United States does not compromise with 
North Korea in a manner it may deem fit, merely for its 
diplomatic reputation. 
  If the UN Security Council imposes sanctions on North Korea 
one week from now according to the recommendation by the IAEA 
based on the final report of its Board of Governors, the 
government should actively participate in it and suspend 
exchange of manpower and goods with North Korea. Furthermore, 
it is needless to say that the government should prepare for the 
possible provocation by North Korea, which will have been thrown 
into a corner. 
  What is most important at present is the government's North 
Korean policy. Therefore, security-related officials should be 
united in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue.
