Amid protests from Beijing, Taipei yesterday welcomed moves by the US to
boost unofficial ties with the island, but complained the changes, announced
late on Wednesday did not go far enough.
Following a lengthy policy review, Washington will permit high-level
bilateral meetings in government offices. Taipei's de facto embassy in the
US, the Co-ordination Council for North American Affairs, will become known
as the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office.
'We are happy to see and welcome the Clinton administration's policy
adjustment toward us, but we are also dissatisfied with certain areas where
we hope the US government can adopt a practical attitude to make further
improvements,' Mr Frederick Chien, Taiwan's foreign minister, told
reporters. He voiced disappointment that the US would not back Taiwan's bid
to rejoin the United Nations.
An angry Beijing sharply denounced the adjustments, warning, without
specifying precisely how, that thawing Sino-US ties would suffer as a
consequence. China views Taiwan as a renegade province. The US switched
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, implicitly
acknowledging China's claim to sovereignty over the island.
The US State Department said the enhanced contacts did not represent a
deviation from the US's 'one-China' policy. The changes were made 'for the
purpose of solving practical problems and doing business', according to a
department official. 'They carry with them no implication that we consider
the relationship (with Taipei) to be official.'
The change coincides with a standoff among Taiwan, China and Japan over
whether Taiwan's president, Mr Lee Teng-hui, should be permitted to attend
the Asian Games in Hiroshima early next month.
The US adjustment will be closely watched and could precipitate similar
changes by other governments.
The American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei, which has long lobbied for
upgraded ties, said the US moves would improve business links but did not go
'as far as we would have liked'. Taiwan was the US's fifth-largest trading
partner in 1993, buying US goods and services to double the value of China's
trade.
While the island's economic strength played an important role in policy
change, its democratic transformation since martial law was lifted in 1987
has not escaped attention.
Mr Shen Guofang, spokesman for China's foreign ministry, charged that the US
upgrade 'seriously violates the principles' on which bilateral relations are
based and 'interferes with the internal affairs of China'.
Mr Shen went on to menace Japan, saying if President Lee is issued travel
documents allowing him to attend the Asian Games, Sino-Japanese ties will be
affected. 'If Lee Teng-hui goes to Japan to attend the Asian Games, it will
bring serious political troubles to the Asian Games,' he said, declining to
elaborate.
President Lee is refusing to knuckle under to pressure to politely decline
an invitation from the Olympic Council of Asia, putting the Japanese
government in an embarrassing position. China earlier threatened a boycott,
which could prove disastrous for the games as China's athletes are the
region's strongest and comprise the biggest delegation.
Analysts said Beijing fears an increasingly assertive and confident Taiwan
is successfully punching through the diplomatic isolation which has shrouded
the island since the UN granted Taipei's seat in the body to Beijing in
1971. Eyeing Taiwan's economic clout, countries which recognise Beijing are
increasingly willing to risk provoking tantrums from Beijing to informally
host Taiwanese officials.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported yesterday that Beijing has
drafted a 'war plan' to suppress Taiwan's gains in the diplomatic arena. The
plan, approved by President Jiang Zemin, calls for a carrot-and-stick
approach.
Taiwan will relaunch its bid to rejoin the UN when the body reconvenes this
fall. But China holds veto power as a permanent member of the security
council, and is likely to block Taipei's efforts as it did last year.
In Tokyo an embarrassed government was attempting to stay on the sidelines.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's Socialist prime minister, said it would be
difficult to arrange for Mr Lee's attendance at the games, but stopped short
of barring him.
China's political and economic weight as Japan's second largest trade
partner, and the largest military power in the region means Japan is under
compelling pressure to put China first. But a snub to Taiwan would harm
Tokyo's policy of trying to keep the widest possible circle of friends among
its Asian neighbours.
Japanese government officials had no doubt their political masters would
ultimately have to bend to China's wishes. Tokyo entertains diplomatic
relations with Beijing but not with Taipei, they pointed out.
