  [Text] Beijing must give up its big brotherism and cease 
to intervene in Taiwan's efforts to develop foreign relations if 
it wants to see a steady normalization of relations between the 
two sides. Unfortunately, there is no sign of Beijing changing 
that policy. Even recently, Beijing tried all means it could to 
block an eight-day unofficial visit by President Li Teng-hui to 
three Southeast Asian countries, though to no avail. 
  Mainland China's repeated warnings and protests did not 
bully 
the Philippines and Indonesia, the first two nations of Li's 
three- country tour, into refusing to receive him. Both 
Philippine President Fidel Ramos and Indonesian President 
Suharto held talks with Li over economic and other bilateral 
issues. 
  It is still not known whether Thai Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai will meet Li today when the president leaves Thailand, 
the last leg of his Southeast Asian trip, and flies back to 
Taiwan. But Chuan has earlier refuted Beijing's protests by 
defending Bangkok's right to allow President Li to visit 
Thailand. 
  Mainland China's persistent intervention in Taiwan's efforts 
to promote relations with foreign countries is unreasonable, as 
it takes no consideration at all of the island's needs for 
expanding such ties. 
  Taiwan, as an island economy with few natural resources and 
limited domestic market, cannot afford to isolate itself from 
the rest of the world without international economic and 
political relations. 
  Taiwan must go to the world to look for more trade and 
investment opportunities abroad for its companies. And it must 
promote technological, scientific and cultural exchanges with 
other nations to enhance economic and social development. 
  Also, with increasing income and more leisure time, local 
citizens in growing numbers want to go abroad to spend their 
vacations, thereby to gain a firsthand chance to understand 
other nations and their people. 
  Yet to administer all these exchanges with foreign nations 
and to better protect its businessmen's and travelers' interests 
abroad, it is necessary for Taiwan to establish relations and 
high-level contacts with other governments. 
  Beijing's stubborn attempts to block Taiwan from developing 
closer contacts with foreign nations also demonstrates its 
ignorance of the realities of present-day world relations. 
  Taiwan, given its growing economic and financial powers, 
offers a lot-of business opportunities. Foreign governments 
would not be willing to pass up such opportunities by submitting 
to Beijing's unjustifiable demands and refusing to have ties 
with Taiwan. 
  A most vivid illustration of this is the reception the three 
South-east Asian governments have extended to President Li 
during his eight-day tour, in spite of the repeated protests 
from Beijing. 
  The leaders in Beijing may contend that their intervention 
to 
isolate Taiwan internationally is necessary to help prevent this 
island from becoming independent from China. It is wrong. Such 
intervention will only provoke resentment among local citizens, 
impede improvement of bilateral relations and prolong the 
division of the two sides. 
  In the interest of reunification, as pointed out recently by 
Premier Lien Chan, Beijing must abandon its big brother 
mentality and cease to treat Taiwan like the big fish swallowing 
the small one.
