  [Excerpts] Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan played golf 
with visiting Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui in Phuket 
yesterday and described the meeting as a private one without 
political implications. [passage omitted] 
  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said he spoke briefly with 
Amnuai before the latter departed for Phuket. "I have made it 
clear to Amnuai that Thailand adheres to a one-China policy. He 
says his planned meeting with Li is an informal one to discuss 
business matters," Prasong said. 
  He said he yesterday also reiterated Thailand's one-China 
policy with China's Ambassador to Thailand Jin Quihua when they 
were seeing off Czech President Vaclav Havel at the airport. 
"China should understand Thailand's foreign policy and accept my 
explanation via its ambassador," Prasong said. [passage omitted] 
  Prasong said it did not matter if Amnuai received Li or 
hosted a dinner for him and his entourage on personal level. "I 
don't believe Amnuai will go to the airport to greet Li on his 
arrival," Prasong said. [passage omitted]
