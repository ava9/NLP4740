  [Text] The separatist tendency within Taiwan's leadership 
is far more dangerous to cross-strait relations than the Qiandao 
Lake murders, according to former premier Hau Pei-tsun. Mr Hau, 
vice-chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT), lamented the decline of 
the ruling party and expressed worry that the KMT might lose to 
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party in the 1996 
presidential election if its leadership failed to "wake up and 
face up to" its problems. 
  In an interview with Hong Kong journalists, the former 
premier said the separatist arguments expressed by individual 
political leaders in Taiwan hurt cross-strait relations more 
than the Qiandao Lake murders. The murders, when three 
mainlanders killed 24 Taiwanese tourists on board a pleasure 
boat in the Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang Province in March, at one 
point almost brought Taiwan- mainland exchanges to a standstill. 
  Although Mr Hau did not identify the political leaders, 
political analysts said he was referring to President Li 
Teng-hui who caused an uproar in the island last month when he 
described the KMT as a "foreign regime" and compared his 
government in Taiwan with those of Moses leading the Israelites 
out of Egypt in an interview with Japanese writer Ryotaro Shiba. 
  When asked to comment on Mr Li's remarks, Mr Hau said: "Oh! 
All I can say is that I can hardly understand. I can't agree 
with this kind of talk. But I am not in power and I take no 
responsibility. These (arguments) are the most important reason 
behind the present poor relationship between the mainland and 
Taiwan," he said. "They are even far more harmful than the 
Qiandao Lake incident," he added. 
  The former premier, who stepped down last year, also greatly 
disapproved of the rise of the so-called "strongman-like 
politics" in the KMT and did not hide his frustration in the 
interview that the KMT was no longer the same political party 
founded by the national father Dr Sun Yat-sen a century ago. 
  Instead, it was the New Party -- a spin-off from the KMT 
last 
year -- that could truly claim to be the real KMT, he said. "In 
reality, it is the New Party which represents the traditional 
value of the KMT... But I can't join the New Party, as a real 
KMT, (I believe) one must stay in the party and try to do 
something to reform the party," he said. "The problem we (KMT) 
face today is that we can't find a consensus within the party. 
This is very unhealthy and this struggle for (political) power 
got mixed with the lust for (personal) gains. This is a 
fundamental problem facing the KMT today and we need to look 
into it seriously," he said. And Mr Li, who is the KMT 
chairman, could not deny responsibility for the present poor 
shape of the party, Mr Hau said. 
  Although the former premier said he was optimistic Taiwan 
and 
the mainland would eventually be reunited, he made it clear 
Taipei could not accept the "one-country-two-system" formula 
suggested by Beijing. Instead of bullying Taiwan, Beijing 
should resume political reform and democratisation before both 
sides could engage in meaningful discussions on reunification. 
  But Mr Hau said both Taiwan and the mainland must first 
accept the principles of "one China, (reunification) through 
peaceful and democratic means" as the "basis for negotiation." 
"In my view, cross-strait relations can improve gradually if we 
(can accept) these principles."
