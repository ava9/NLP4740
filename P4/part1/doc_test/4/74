  [Text] Taipei, May 19 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui 
Thursday [19 May] urged mainland Chinese authorities to face the 
reality of China's division with new concepts and new strategies. 
  President Li made the call in his national affairs address 
to 
the National Assembly which is meeting on Yangmingshan in 
suburban Taipei to discuss sweeping constitutional reforms. 
  Li said Beijing's resistance to recognizing China's division 
into two separate parts has hindered the establishment of mutual 
trust between the two sides of the Taiwan strait, adding he 
hopes the mainland leadership will abandon its aggressive 
attitude toward Taiwan and take the initiative to promote 
peaceful competition between the two sides for the well-being of 
the Chinese people. 
  He continued that defending the security of Taiwan, Penghu, 
Kinmen and Matsu is now the top goal of the Republic of China 
[ROC]'s national defense policy. 
  "We are seeking to beef up our defense capabilities by 
purchasing advanced arms and enhancing combat preparedness while 
trimming redundant military personnel," he explained. 
  The ROC is also seeking to join as many international 
organizations as possible, the president noted. With the end of 
the Cold War, Li said, a new world order is taking shape. 
  "Representation in major world organizations would enable US 
to participate in discussions and formulation of new 
international regulations," he noted. 
  The ROC will continue to promote trade with its major 
trading 
partners, such as the United States, Japan and European 
countries, Li said. In addition, the ROC will strengthen 
economic cooperation with Southeast Asian nations as part of its 
efforts to help boost Asia-Pacific regional economic integration. 
  Li pointed out that the Republic of China has created in the 
Taiwan area a multi-party democratic system which has never 
existed in Chinese history. "We should not be complacent with 
our current achievements, but should strive even harder for 
continued national development," he noted. 
  Li said the government is determined to promote further 
economic and political reforms, foster a cultural renaissance 
and improve welfare services. 
  The president said all National Assembly members are welcome 
to present their opinions on constitutional reforms and national 
affairs. He promised to attend the assembly sessions for the 
next five days to hear their opinions and reply to their 
questions. 
  This is the first time for an ROC president to participate 
in 
the National Assembly national affairs discussions in their 
entirety. In the past, the president was present only on the 
first day of such sessions, with the secretary-general of the 
presidential office then attending the remaining sessions on the 
president's behalf. 
  During its current special three-month session, the National 
Assembly is expected to pass a package of amendments to the ROC 
constitution to lay a framework for further democratic reforms, 
including direct popular election of the country's president and 
vice president.
