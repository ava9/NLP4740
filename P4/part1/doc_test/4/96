  [Excerpts] Taiwan President Li Teng-hui, accompanied by 
his wife and a 40-member delegation, arrived in Phuket on 
Valentine's Day. [passage omitted] 
  Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan, in his personal 
capacity, hosted a party for the Taiwan president and his 
delegation at the Dusit Laguna Hotel last night. Chen Youhan 
[Thai name: Chatri Sophonphanit; president of the Bangkok 
Bank], Hu Yulin [Thai Name: Saman Ophatwong; chairman of the 
Thai Rice Exporters Association], Li Guanglong [Thai Name: 
Wisit Lilasithon; chairman of the Wall Street Finance &amp; 
Securities Company and the Wall Street Tower], and Chen Zhuohao 
[Thai name: Sumit Loetsumit; chairman of the board of directors 
of the Si Thai Superware Company] were among the Thai-Chinese 
businessmen invited to attend the banquet. 
  An informed source told our correspondent that Li Teng-hui's 
visit resulted from mediation by Gu Liansong, who has close 
relations with the Thai-Chinese business community and once was 
chairman of the Taiwan-Thai Business Committee and advisor to 
Taiwan's Executive Branch. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai met President Li while 
attending 
an international monetary meeting in Taiwan late last year. 
Yesterday's meeting was the second between Amnuai and Li 
Teng-hui in seven months. 
  Meanwhile, a Chinese National People's Congress [NPC] 
delegation led by Zhu Liang, chairman of the NPC Foreign Affairs 
Committee, may delay or cancel its visit to Thailand as a result 
of Li Teng-hui's visit. The delegation is scheduled to visit 
Thailand at the end of this month at the invitation of 
Parliament President Marut Bunnak.
