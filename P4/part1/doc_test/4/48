  [Text] Labor and Social Welfare Minister Phaithun 
Kaeothong has denied a report that he is scheduled to hold talks 
on economic and investment issues with Taiwan President Li 
Teng-hui, who is on a vacation in Thailand. Asked to comment on 
the PRC Government's dissatisfaction with countries who have 
welcomed the Taiwan president, Phaithun said that the Chinese 
Government should understand this issue well because China 
itself recognizes Taiwanese investment. The Cabinet, however, 
has allowed talks with the Taiwan president on economic, 
cultural, and educational affairs. 
  [Begin recording] [Phaithun] Yes, we have contacts through 
the private sector for labor issues. The government only 
extends its cooperation; this has nothing to do with politics. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Although there are only talks 
on economic issues, it could upset China. 
  [Phaithun] Mainland China itself recognizes Taiwanese 
investment. Taiwan also has investments in Thailand. There 
should be no problem discussing economic affairs. [end
