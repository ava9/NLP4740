the president has publicly sought the support of the people

Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui is putting his prestige and political future
on the line by publicly campaigning for candidates of his ruling nationalist
party, the Kuomintang (KMT), in city and county elections to be held on
Saturday.
The election is the first to take place since Mr Lee completed the process
of bringing the Taiwan government and the KMT under the control of
Taiwan-born leaders this year. The results could affect the stability of his
hold on power and the progress of liberalising political and economic
reforms.
Mr Lee said last week that his campaigning marked the first time in Taiwan's
 -or China's - history 'that the head of state has directly faced the
people'.
County and city mayors have wide powers over their districts. They exercise
control over local police forces, grant business and development licences
and arbitrate environmental or labour disputes. This makes them the focus of
intense contention among political and financial interests.
Of most relevance to the ruling party is the fact that mayors also oversee
the administration of elections.
The KMT holds 13 mayorships. The main opposition Democratic Progressive
party controls seven cities and counties. There is also one city run by a
pro-DPP independent.
Further erosion could damage the KMT's hopes in elections next year for
Taiwan provincial governor and for the mayors of the big Taipei and
Kaohsiung municipalities.
In a blow to the KMT's fortunes yesterday, a senior member of the party
defected to the opposition Chinese New Party, which was formed in August by
a group of rebel KMT legislators.
Mr Hsu Li-nung, a veteran leader of the ruling party's conservative wing and
a member of its central advisory committee, said he was joining the New
Party because he was disgusted with rampant corruption.
On the campaign front, Mr Lee's longer-term aim seems to be his ambition to
become Taiwan's first directly-elected president, says Mr Huang Hui-chen,
executive director of the Institute for National Policy Research think-tank.
Mr Lee was elected indirectly in 1990 by the National Assembly to a six-year
term. There are moves to submit a constitutional amendment to allow direct
presidential elections before his term expires.
Despite previous denials about running for president, Mr Lee last week left
the door open when he told the China Times newspaper: 'It's not yet time to
make a decision.'
'If Lee wants to continue his reforms, he needs to firm up the KMT's control
at the local level or else his control over the KMT itself may weaken,' Mr
Huang notes.
Mr Lee and the opposition DPP were often indirect allies in past
confrontations with more conservative mainland-born KMT leaders.
The last powerful mainland-born leaders were sidelined by Mr Lee at the 14th
KMT Congress in August. This now pits 'a Taiwanese KMT against a Taiwanese
DPP,' says Mr Huang.
Mr Lee's greatest risk on the campaign trail is that he may wear out his
welcome among the electorate which has indicated widespread approval of his
moves to liberalise Taiwan's political regime.
'The main result of this campaign will be the disappearance of the Lee
Teng-hui love-knot,' says Mr Chao Shao-kang, convener of the New Party.
'Many voters forgive him for everything as he's the first Taiwanese
president, but his dictatorial ways won't be tolerated forever,' Mr Chao
says.
Meanwhile the DPP is campaigning primarily on the clean and generally
effective performance of its mayors. Like those of the New Party, DPP
candidates have also pointed to a series of big cases of corruption or
inefficiency, including delays and cost overruns of KMT-run Taipei city's
mass transit system.
