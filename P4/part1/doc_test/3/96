THE UK government and Olympia &amp; York are at an advanced stage in talks on a
multi-million-pound property deal which would help rescue the troubled
developer.
The deal would involve the government taking 500,000 square feet of space at
O&amp;Y's Canary Wharf development in East London, in return for a commitment
from the company that it will make its Pounds 400m contribution to the costs
of extending the capital's Jubilee underground line.
Talks between Toronto-based O&amp;Y and the government were already taking place
before the company ran into financial difficulties two months ago with debts
of Dollars 12bn.
However, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has accelerated
the negotiations in the hope that they will help to stabilise the company's
financial position.
Meanwhile, in a move to reassure its creditors, O&amp;Y disclosed yesterday that
it had placed shares pledged as collateral on a Dollars 2.5bn 'jumbo' loan
in the custody of a Canadian bank. The shares represent O&amp;Y's 82 per cent
interest in Abitibi-Price, the newsprint producer, and its 75 per cent stake
in Gulf Canada Resources, an oil and gas producer.
O&amp;Y said the move was to give creditors 'a level of confidence'.
A deal with the government on the space at Canary Wharf, Europe's biggest
property development, is unlikely to be finalised for a few weeks. But
sources close to the talks said that the Department of Trade and Industry
under Mr Heseltine and the Department of Environment, his previous
department, were both expected to take space.
Under the proposal thousands of civil servants would move to London's
Docklands, though ministers would remain in Whitehall and Westminster.
If the deal is clinched, that should help O&amp;Y to refinance individual Canary
Wharf buildings, which in turn would provide it with the funds for its
contribution to extending the Jubilee line into London's Docklands.
The 11 lenders to the Pounds 3bn Canary Wharf project yesterday agreed to
provide O&amp;Y with Pounds 21m of new borrowings to meet its expenses for the
rest of May. The money was provided only after extreme pressure was put on
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which was threatening to put the
Docklands project into administration under UK insolvency procedures by
withholding its share of the new money.
In a series of meetings with its 15 principal bank creditors over the past
two days, O&amp;Y has outlined its five-year financing requirements. It wants a
Pounds 300m revolving credit facility to complete phases one and two of
Canary Wharf.
However, the Canary Wharf banks said yesterday they were unhappy that a
substantial portion of this Pounds 300m was being raised for the sole
purpose of allowing O&amp;Y to pay them the interest they are owed. They say
they would rather have O&amp;Y shares in place of cash interest, which is what
the parent company's banks have been offered.
The Canary Wharf lenders are, however, being offered shares in Canary Wharf
itself. But one banker said yesterday that 'at the moment these are worth
nothing'.
On the other hand, the parent company bank group, which is owed Dollars 4bn
and is being offered O&amp;Y 'B' class non-voting shares, yesterday complained
about the absence of voting rights on these shares.
The main element in this Dollars 4bn is the Dollars 2.5bn 'jumbo' loan. O&amp;Y
has shocked the providers of this jumbo loan by telling them that its cash
flow over the coming five years will only cover between 40 and 50 per cent
of the interest due on the loan. So the lenders may have to receive the
remainder in the form of shares.
Banks in general said that the latest refinancing proposals from O&amp;Y,
presented on Thursday, were a big improvement on what was offered three
weeks ago and could serve as the basis for further negotiations.
