The government last night appeared to have performed a U-turn by accepting
that it would be prepared to pay 'shadow tolls' to investors in privately
financed motorways.
A statement issued by the Treasury said that promoters of private schemes
would 'receive payments from the Government in relation to the level of
traffic using the road.'
Ministers previously have rejected the use of shadow tolls saying they
removed much of the risk from investors.
The Treasury has consistently said that an element of risk should be an
integral part of any private investment in infrastructure.
Officials said yesterday that the Department of Transport would hold 'early
discussions with the construction industry and others to identify
appropriate schemes.'
Longer term it expected to move to a system of electronic motorway charging
when the technology was ready.
The government also approved a string of schemes which it wants the private
sector to finance build and and in some cases operate. These included a
Pounds 600m modernisation of Britain's deteriorating west coast main railway
line.
A new Pounds 200m Scottish air traffic control centre for the Civil Aviation
Authority is proposed to expand capacity for flights to and across Scotland
and the North Atlantic.
A Pounds 100m project will extend the London Docklands Light Railway south
from the Isle of Dogs via a new tunnel under the Thames to Lewisham. Bids
will be invited during next year with a view to opening the new service in
1997-98.
The Chancellor cited the Aintree NHS Trust in Liverpool as a model for what
the government wanted. Here, the private sector will build and operate a
100-bed low-dependency patient hotel, with conference and catering
facilities in the grounds of Fazakerly Hospital.
The NHS Trust will contract for a proportion of the facilities in the
patient hotel. Spare capacity will be sold by the private operator to other
customers.
Other private sector finance initiatives include provision for new prisons
and secure training centres.
