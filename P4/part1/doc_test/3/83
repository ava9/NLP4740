Case Study: Texaco at Canary Wharf

MOVING from the stylish environs of Knightsbridge to the brave new world of
Canary Wharf was a big upheaval for the 1,000 employees of Texaco, the
US-owned energy group. It was also something of a gamble for their
employers.
The latest, big arrival at Canary Wharf - the move was completed in March -
has taken up residence at 1 Westferry Circus, from where it now operates its
group headquarters.
Texaco's move from offices close to Harrods was forced upon it by an
expiring lease and a landlord who wanted to redevelop, but the choice of
where to go next was its own.
By 1987, it was clear to the company's executives that the business would
have to move from several addresses in the area - held on highly beneficial,
historic terms and conditions which it knew could not be repeated.
The commercial property market was powering ahead, with West End rents
escalating and landlords holding all of the cards. An analysis showed that,
while some core personnel had to remain in the centre of London, the others
did not. The decision was taken to look beyond the M25 motorway and, in all
probability to the west of London.
But the arrival of Mr Peter Bijur as chairman of the UK operations brought a
change in strategy. Mr Bijur, who has since moved on within Texaco, was keen
that Texaco operations should be integrated. He wanted a single site.
A variety of options were considered but Canary Wharf, which had been
considered at an earlier stage of the relocation exercise, emerged at the
top of the list. The quality of office space was regarded as without equal
and, despite some concerns over transport links, the comparative price of
accommodation made a powerful argument for moving east.
By mid-1989, Texaco had signed a commitment to lease floorspace not then
completed and undertook an extensive operation, with the help of the London
Docklands Development Corporation, to assist staff in calculating the impact
on them of the change in address and in devising new routes to work.
In early 1990, employees were taken down to docklands to see the development
for themselves and to hear LDDC officials sing the praises of what was still
largely a building site. There were obviously reservations but there was,
also, some surprise at the quality of the working environment being built.
Mr Roger Colombe, a Texaco managing director in charge of administration,
says that transport links were the most obvious source of concern to staff
but that detailed discussions took place to assess the problems and secure
suitable travel arrangements. The company also negotiated a series of deals
intended to ease the cost and complexity of the journey to work. 'The
problem of getting to work is far less than many people originally believed.
It will get even better now that some important links in the transport chain
are being completed,' says Mr Colombe.
Around a third of Texaco employees now drive to work, about 130 use the
river bus service and the remainder use the docklands light railway, with
its much-improved services.
Despite the upheaval, Texaco says that the number of staff leaving as a
result of the decision to move has been small. It reckons that, last year,
fewer than half a dozen people departed because of the move, although it
accepts that at a time of high unemployment, some people remain who might
otherwise have been tempted to find more convenient employment.
Texaco has not disclosed how much it is paying for its accommodation at
Canary Wharf but says it is happy that the rent is highly competitive,
relative to the market and to the sort of accommodation costs being paid by
its competitors.
In short, Texaco does not believe that it has, in any sense, placed itself
at a commercial disadvantage. The move itself went smoothly and the business
has not been disrupted.
The company recognises that staff may not be entirely satisfied with the
range of facilities on hand nearby to the office worker - 'more shops]' is a
constant cry from people used to the rich, retailing facilities along the
Brompton Road and Knightsbridge.
But Texaco believes that the area will ultimately fulfil the vision of the
developers and says that its move will have proved to be the right one.
According to Jane Bentley, a Texaco secretary: 'The surroundings are
delightful and the views are wonderful. We could do with more a 'community
feel' around us, but that will come in time. Overall, I think most people
are quite happy with the move.'
