Contracts

The announcement of ambitious targets for the government's private finance
initiative prompted a mixture of hope and scepticism in financial and civil
engineering circles.
Contracts for some Pounds 5bn private sector investment are expected to be
placed next year, said Mr Clarke.
His remarks confirmed the government's commitment to its private finance
initiative, but indicated the long lead times which are necessary to get
large projects off the ground.
Industry and City sources said they were disappointed that no new schemes
were announced yesterday.
The catalogue of schemes proposed to be placed this year was described by
some construction companies bidding for the projects as 'old hat' and little
more than a 'wish list'.
There had been hopes that the chancellor would give the go-ahead for at
least one light rail scheme and for additional road schemes to be financed
and built by the private sector. None was forthcoming.
'It was encouraging that the chancellor devoted 10 minutes to the private
finance initiative so early on in his speech but surprising that no new
specific projects were mentioned,' said Mr Richard Millward, director
responsible for the initiative at merchant bankers Kleinwort Benson.
The only scheme where progress seems imminent is the modernisation of the
rolling stock for London Underground's Northern Line, valued at about Pounds
400m plus a further Pounds 300m if long-term maintenance is included in the
contract. Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, will announce a decision
on the award of a contract 'very soon,' Mr Clarke said.
The chancellor assured his listeners yesterday that 'significant progress'
had been made on the transport schemes referred to in last year's budget:
the Pounds 600m modernisation of the west-coast main-line railway; a new
Pounds 200m air traffic control centre for Scotland; and a Pounds 100m
extension of the Docklands Light Railway south to Lewisham.
Studies are going on into the detail of the west-coast modernisation and
bids are to be sought from the private sector for the Docklands extension
and the Scottish air traffic centre. But the construction industry, rolling
stock manufacturers and potential users are impatient for work to start and
this is likely to take some time.
'We have succeeded in developing a massive portfolio of work in progress,'
said Mr Douglas Hogg, a member of the Private Finance Panel's executive
committee. 'We will be working on this over the next six to nine months but
it is just too early to expect anything yet. These projects involve long
lead times.'
