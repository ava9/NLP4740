FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: In search of distinction - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the Tory Party's problems is that so many of its ministers seem to
look and talk alike: all part of the same Cambridge mafia. There is no-one
distinctive like the old transport minister, Ernie Marples: even Norman
Tebbit, who had some claim to be different, is on his way out. Yet there is
a case for saying that every government needs a Marples.
Labour has one, also connected with transport, in John Prescott, the
pugnacious MP for Hull East. There was a time when he looked an
embarrassment to some of his smoother and more revisionist colleagues. But
Prescott has stuck to his task and almost everyone must now recognise his
blunt tones. In one way, however, he has trimmed, promising to spend money
'only when resources allow'.
At the weekend, Prescott pledged to take the eccentrically unreliable
Docklands Light Railway back into public ownership immediately after the
election. There would, of course, be handsome compensation for the London
Docklands Development Corporation, the government-sponsored body to which
the railway is supposed to be handed over shortly as a first step towards
privatisation. Prescott offered Pounds 2 instead of the Pounds 1 that the
LDDC is said to be paying.
