The government last night appeared to have performed a U-turn by accepting
that it would be prepared to pay 'shadow tolls' to investors in privately
financed motorways.
A statement issued by the Treasury said that promoters of private schemes
would 'receive payments from the government in relation to the level of
traffic using the road'.
Ministers have previously rejected the use of shadow tolls, saying they
removed much of the risk from investors.
Officials said yesterday that the Department of Transport would hold 'early
discussions with the construction industry and others to identify
appropriate schemes'. The department expects to award the first contracts in
about 18 months.
In the longer term it expects to adopt a system of electronic motorway
charging as soon as the technology is ready.
The government also approved a string of schemes which it wants the private
sector to finance, build and, in some cases, operate. These included a
Pounds 600m modernisation of Britain's deteriorating west coast main railway
line.
A new Pounds 200m Scottish air traffic control centre for the Civil Aviation
Authority is proposed, to expand capacity for flights to and across Scotland
and the North Atlantic.
A Pounds 100m project will extend the London Docklands Light Railway south
from the Isle of Dogs via a new tunnel under the Thames to Lewisham. Bids
will be invited during next year with a view to opening the new service in
1997-98.
The chancellor cited the Aintree NHS Trust in Liverpool as a model of what
the government wanted. Here, the private sector will build and operate a
100-bed low-dependency patient hotel, with conference and catering
facilities in the grounds of Fazakerly Hospital.
Other private sector finance initiatives include provision for new prisons
and secure training centres.
The budget also marked a shift in the balance of public spending on
transport away from roads and towards rail and underground.
According to the department's three-year projections, spending on the
national road network will fall from Pounds 2.09bn in this financial year to
Pounds 1.96bn in 1995-96.
Spending on rail will fall from Pounds 1.5bn to Pounds 975m while London
Transport will rise from Pounds 722m to Pounds 930m. Over the three years,
however, spending on London Transport will be Pounds 364m less than
projected earlier this year. London Transport said it was 'profoundly
disappointed'.
