FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Finance from private sector is emphasised -
Infrastructure projects
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The extension of London's Docklands Light Railway south of the Thames to
Lewisham is one of several infrastructure schemes which are to go ahead as
joint ventures between the public and private sectors.
This is a Pounds 100m project to extend the railway south from the Isle of
Dogs to Lewisham through a new tunnel beneath the Thames.
The extension will be designed, built, financed and maintained by the
private sector, and the new service will be operated by DLR.
Mr Clarke also announced several schemes which are to be financed wholly
from the private sector. These include modernisation of the west coast main
line of British Rail, which runs from London Euston to Glasgow through Crewe
and Carlisle. Detailed proposals will be announced today. The project will
cost up to Pounds 600m and will be taken forward to the project-definition
stage.
A Pounds 200m air traffic control centre for Scotland is to be established
as a wholly private-sector project, the Treasury continued.
The private sector will be invited to finance, design, build and maintain
the centre, and the project will be financially free-standing. The centre
will expand capacity for flights to and across Scotland and the north
Atlantic. The private sector will be invited to tender to finance, design,
build and maintain the centre, which will be used by the Civil Aviation
Authority.
Information for potential contractors for two of the six prisons to be built
using private finance will be issued shortly.
The Treasury said that the government's commitment to big infrastructure
projects was shown by the fact that work on building the Heathrow Express
rail link between London Paddington and Heathrow had begun, and that part of
a significant rationalisation of NHS Trust facilities at Aintree in
Liverpool was going out to tender as a privately-financed project. This
innovative scheme may serve as a model for similar projects.
The Aintree Hospitals NHS Trust is going out to tender on a scheme which
will involve the private sector in a wider project to rationalise the two
main acute sites.
Under the proposed scheme, it is envisaged that the private sector will
build and operate a 100-bed hotel, conference, catering and other facilities
on the Fazakerley Hospital site. The NHS trust would contract for a
proportion of the facilities offered, including beds in the low dependency
unit (patient hotel). The additional capacity would be sold by the private
sector operator to other customers.
The government also intends to take the necessary powers to allow the
involvement of the private sector in the provision of secure training
centres, the Treasury said.
It added that feasibility studies into how the second Forth road bridge
might be privately financed were nearing completion.
Following the issue of a pre-qualification document in September, several UK
and international companies have formally expressed interest in
participating in a competition if the government decides to proceed.
