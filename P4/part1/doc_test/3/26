FT  14 JAN 92 / Personal view: A fairer way to fund public transport

The financing of British public transport is in a mess. More investment is
desirable because demand for public transport grew unexpectedly fast in the
1980s, while projects such as the Channel Tunnel and the redevelopment of
London's docklands will give rise to even more demand. But these projects
have failed to attract significant private funds as the government had
hoped; at the same time the government's desire to control public
expenditure has limited the amount of public capital that it is prepared to
invest.
Many believe that public expenditure on transport should be increased. The
Labour party has proposed that public corporations should be able to borrow
directly from the private sector. But there must always be some limit on
public expenditure; merely changing the method of borrowing does not alter
its economic consequences. The real requirement is to make the investment
more profitable, and the way to do so is to collect more payments from those
who benefit.
The paradox of investment in public transport is that it can create
substantial benefits, especially around cities, yet produces low financial
returns because the operator cannot charge many of the beneficiaries of its
investment. The users of new or improved services can be made to contribute
to the cost in fares, but they cannot be made to pay all the costs of a new
underground line, for example. The cost of construction is so high that
profit may be unattainable. But the other beneficiaries, the landlords and
developers who own property in the area served by the the service, can
rarely be made to pay anything for their gains.
These gains are represented by increases in the value of property from
improved access, or decreases in value avoided by preventing deterioration
in access. Property owners in cities have for decades been subsidised by the
private and public sector financiers of transport systems, who have made
possible the expansion of city-centre activities but have not profited from
their pains.
Where a large new development is undertaken, such as that at Canary Wharf in
London's docklands, specific improvements in transport will be essential to
the commercial success of the project. One or a few developers can then be
identified as the beneficiaries from the improved transport, and they can
then be expected to pay for their gains.
The government has recently attempted to apply this principle by seeking
contributions from developers towards the cost of extending London
Transport's railway system into docklands, but the amounts collected have
been small. The extension of the Jubilee line is expected to increase the
rents achievable at Olympia and York's Canary Wharf development; but Olympia
and York and British Gas - which owns land that the extension will serve -
have contributed only 17 per cent of its cost. Olympia and York has also
contributed about 40 per cent of the Pounds 110m spent on improving the
Docklands Light Railway, which will be the only railway serving Canary Wharf
when it is completed.
Substantial contributions can only be obtained if negotiations start before
either the developer or the transport authority have committed themselves to
any expenditure. If the developer is to be expected to pay much, he must
understand that the improvements will not be made without his support; and
if he is to pay for them, he needs to know what they will cost when
forecasting his profits. Once a commitment has been given to build a new
line, little can be collected from developers along its route.
Improving the sources of finance for general investment in urban public
transport depends on some means of collecting the smaller benefits which
each landlord receives from the existence of such a system, and from any
subsequent improvements. These small benefits cannot easily be identified or
collected from landlords. A tax paid by landlords therefore seems the most
suitable method of appropriating a share in these benefits for the operator
of the transport system.
Such a property tax would be a supplement to the business rate, but paid by
the holder of the head lease or the freehold of each property. The size of
this charge should be determined locally, not nationally, because its level
would represent a choice between burdens on local travellers and burdens on
local landlords, which would best be decided by the representatives they
elect.
Increased property values in a city created by improvements in local
transport are likely to reflect transfers of business to that city from
other parts of the country, rather than any increase in the national level
of output.
These benefits are therefore more appropriately financed by local than
national taxation. If national taxes are used to support transport in
cities, funds will be transferred from the poorer to the richer districts
and individuals in the country, and to companies which - outside the present
slump - have been among the more profitable.
The proposed method of financing public transport would ensure that it was
paid for by those who benefited from it. Such a system would be efficient as
well as equitable; the beneficiaries could influence the level of
expenditure through their payments and their elected representatives.
Transport operators would invest if their expected revenue from fares, the
property tax and any direct payments from developers would make the
investment profitable. Developers would only launch big projects if they
would be profitable after contributing to the cost of the transport they
would need.
