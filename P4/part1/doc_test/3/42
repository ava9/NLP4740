I WAS on my way to the Surrey Docks Watersports Centre when I came across
the story of the whale oil which lit the lamps of London.
At the Watersports Centre, you can sail, canoe or windsurf if you are over
eight years old and are able to swim 50 metres in light clothes. The whale
oil story, less bracing but more intriguing, is on a Docklands Heritage
information panel near the water's edge at Greenland Dock.
It says: 'Two hundred years ago, you would have been unhappily aware of the
awful stench of rotting whale blubber. Each spring, small ships left here
for six-week dashes to the icy, storm-blown Arctic waters off Greenland.
Half-rotten whale blubber was brought back in casks and boiled in huge
coppers on this dockside to extract the oil. Much of it was used to light
the streets of London.'
Two hundred years later, the lights are no longer lit with oil and whale
hunting is frowned upon. The part of the dock on which the information panel
appears is now called Rainbow Quay after 'the Greenpeace ship Rainbow
Warrior which campaigned against whaling.'
In 200 years' time, visitors to Docklands may find the story of the
twentieth century anti-whaling movement as interesting as the oil lamps of
London. For the record, there are 11 watersports centres in London
Docklands, a 200-metre artificial ski slope, three urban farms and dozens of
pubs and restaurants, some of them very old. There is no leisure activity in
Docklands, however, which beats wandering around.
Docklands has acquired an awful reputation in some quarters. Some of it
comes from local activists who objected to the breakneck development of the
1980s. More of it comes from people who have never been there but have
persuaded themselves, all the same, that it has been a disaster.
Many critics, in this newspaper as much as any other, have excoriated the
architecture, the 'toy-town' Docklands Light Railway and much else. I cannot
understand why. It is true that some of the office building is uninspiring.
But some of the shopping areas in restored wharf buildings are excellent.
And much of the residential development, low-rise and brick, is a distinct
improvement on most of what was done all over London in the three preceding
decades.
Some of the outlying buildings at Canary Wharf - with their transplanted,
straight-out-of-the-box, North American look - do bear a startling
resemblance to the hotels at the Euro Disney theme park outside Paris.
But the queues are shorter at Docklands than at Euro Disney and
entertainment is available at a fraction of the price. The Docklands Light
Railway swoops and veers like a fairground ride. It is easier on the
stomach, however, than Disney's Big Thunder Mountain and you can get on and
off as you like.
If the threat of IRA bombing had not ended plans to allow visitors to ride
the lift to the top of the Canary Wharf tower, there would be no reason to
visit the Paris theme park at all. Unlike Euro Disney, Docklands' surprises
are uncontrived. They slip from the layers of the past that you unravel on
each visit, rather than from the minds of the Disney imagineers.
So far-reaching were London's trading links, that there is hardly a foreign
visitor who is not going to find some Docklands connection. There is, for
example, the Norway Cut Swing Bridge, Finland Quay East and West India Quay.
Did you know that the Mayflower, which took the Pilgrim Fathers to America
in 1620, departed from the riverside quarter of Rotherhithe? Or that its
captain, Christopher James, is buried in St Mary's churchyard, a short walk
from the river?
Rotherhithe is a quiet, clean, settled-looking place. The residents could
make much more of their American connection if they wanted to. Perhaps they
don't. The restored 16th century pub, which was once called the Spread
Eagle, is now called the Mayflower. But apart from a small plaque explaining
this, it doesn't shout about it.
The parish church of St Mary, Rotherhithe, has been a site of Christian
worship for nearly 1,000 years. The current church, splendid in the spring
sunshine, replaced one built in the twelfth century. It was completed in
1715 and was designed by John James, an associate of Sir Christopher Wren.
It beats Sleeping Beauty's Castle.
A little more care could certainly have been taken to ensure that transport
links were developed along with the offices and homes of the new Docklands,
rather than as an after-thought.
Some of the new transport facilities are already looking run-down. Island
Gardens station, through which many tourists pass on their way to the
Greenwich foot tunnel, was strewn with litter when I was there.
But all these moans to some extent miss the point. To travel through
Docklands is to realise that it has often been a place of chaos, of failed
dreams, of wild booms and busts, of perseverance against the odds.
German air raids in September 1940 destroyed all the timber in Surrey Docks
 -350,000 tons in one night.
The flames were visible 30 miles away. On 57 consecutive nights from
September to November 1940, 25,000 bombs rained down on Docklands, making
them the most heavily bombed civilian target in the country. But they stayed
open.
Once a gateway of world trade, Docklands' calm waters are now free for
windsurfing. On dry land, others had new aspirations for the area. No longer
the destination of the world's trading ships, some - such as Paul Reichmann,
Canary Wharf's failed developer - believed London's docklands could be the
electronic gateway to Europe, providing the offices from which business
would be done at the tap of a computer key.
Those new developers have added another layer to the Docklands story. Future
visitors might see the results as the high-water mark of a greedy time,
whose nemesis was both inevitable and richly-deserved. Or they might regard
the new buildings, homes and shops as a testament to a much-maligned decade,
in which, for all the accompanying chicanery and rough manners, a somnolent
nation awoke, however briefly, to the promise of the future. Both
interpretations assume the failure of Docklands in its newest guise. But
that failure is not inevitable; Docklands in its high-tech, electronic form,
might rise again. What, after all, is a four or five-year property slump in
a city as old as London?
In the Docklands Visitor Centre, a history of the area tells us that
London's prosperity died out after 410 AD But the city boomed again, even if
did take 300 years.
