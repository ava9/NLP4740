The most striking image at this year's Schleswig-Holstein festival comes
courtesy of Chagall. A mural displays a colourful world populated by
strangely dislocated figures, including dancers performing physically
impossible hand-stands, a one-legged conductor and a violinist without a
head.
This is one of a group of wall paintings originally intended for the Jewish
Theatre in Moscow, left behind when the artist emigrated in 1922 and only
signed in the 1970s.
They have not been seen before in the west and form part of a fascinating
Chagall exhibition at the Schleswig-Holsteinisches Landesmuseum.
The festival was fortunate to have caught the exhibition on its way round
Europe, as it provides a visual counterpart to the year's musical theme.
Musicians and actors, poets and dancers, all the figures in the wall
paintings are Jewish. Two or three years ago, when funding and sponsorship
was easier to come by, Schleswig-Holstein was able to draw up a wide-ranging
programme for the 1994 festival. It was to look at Jewish music from a
variety of standpoints, including works banned during the Third Reich,
visiting Israeli musicians and music by contemporary Israeli composers.
The subject remains a sensitive one. The synagogue in Lubeck, one of the
main towns on the festival's roving itinerary, was recently the target of an
arson attack, and concert venues where Jewish musicians were performing
found themselves guarded by police with alsations.
The first concert last Sunday brought together all the festival's Jewish
sub-themes on one evening. It was given by the Israel Symphony Orchestra
Rishon Lezion, founded in 1988, of which half the musicians are Russian
emigres.
While many professionals arriving from Russia discover that their
qualifications are not accepted in Israel, the main problem for musicians is
to find an orchestra that can provide work, so founding a new one (if the
money can be raised) is the path to follow.
The programme included one piece that qualified more or less as 'banned'
music, a short elegy entitled Yizkor for viola and string orchestra,
composed by Odon Partos in 1947, reminiscent of Bartok in its harmonic
colouring.
Another short item comprised the 'new' piece, Ben-Zion Orgad's A Vigil in
Jerusalem from 1978, which made up in nocturnal atmosphere what it lacked in
musical substance.
In addition, we had Brigitte Fassbaender as the lead soloist in Die sieben
Todsunden by Kurt Weill, who remains a central figure in the story of what
happened to music in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s despite having emigrated
to the US; and, to finish, Mendelssohn's Fifth Symphony, the 'Reformation'.
As yet, the orchestra's playing lacks finesse and bloom, though the dry
acoustic at the Schloss in Kiel did not help.
For the second concert they moved to the theatre at Itzehoe, two years old
and a more flattering hall for musicians. Bartok's Suite from The Miraculous
Mandarin certainly seemed more vital and Schubert's Ninth Symphony displayed
some rich-toned string playing from time to time, although the orchestra is
still some way behind its compatriots in the Israel Philharmonic, due to
visit Schleswig-Holstein later in the festival.
Noam Sheriff, the Israel Symphony's chief conductor, is primarily a composer
and Tuesday's programme included the premiere of his Piano Concerto. It was
played by Ludmila Berman, a Russian emigre.
With both brevity (it lasts barely 15 minutes) and a cheerful tonal style to
its name, this should not have alienated anybody who came for the Schubert
after the interval.
Various influences hovered in the background, but the finale seemed to
settle on Bach in its two-part invention piano writing and - momentarily -
Beethoven, when the opening bars of his Violin Concerto unexpectedly broke
in just before the end.
The Schleswig-Holstein festival runs until August 21; the Chagall exhibition
at Schloss Gottorf, Schleswig, is on until September 11.
