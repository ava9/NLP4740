Kurt Masur, who has just begun his second season as the New York
Philharmonic's music director, seems to have decided that his first task
must be to develop their expertise in the central 19th-century European
repertory: Schubert, Beethoven, Mendelssohn and Bruckner dominated his first
subscription concerts. But since the orchestra is marking its
sesquicentenary this season, there is some conflict between the earnest
pressures of the future and the celebratory wish to make a noise about the
past. Somebody had the odd idea of commissioning for the anniversary a whole
lot of orchestral 'fanfares': time-consuming things to write and to
rehearse, and destined for instant oblivion. Tobias Picker's Bang] was the
first of these to come and go, producing a stream of rushes, whistles and
flurries for three and a half minutes which is an awful long time for a
firework. Otherwise we were with the classics.
Masur's strengths in the repertory are obvious: his energy and his
self-effacing dedication to the task. But equally plain are his and his
orchestra's problems. Some of these have to do with the Avery Fisher Hall,
where a gentle rake his been introduced in an attempt to lift the woodwind
sound. This is not altogether successful, and the massed violin tone is
harsh - though the desperation in the orchestra's style is a matter more of
rhythm than of sound quality. Masur's emphatic downbeats give his players
too many immediate goals and encourage fuzzy attacks that suggest only a
frustrated forcefulness. That was particularly the effect in Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony, played here near the start of this jubilee season because it
was the very first piece the orchestra performed.
Alongside it, in an unusual moment of didactic programming, Masur placed the
First Symphony, in G minor, by Etienne-Nicolas Mehul, a work whose finale,
as Schumann was the first to observe, has a four-note tag similar to that of
the first movement of Beethoven's Fifth. But one can make too much of this.
Mehul's treatment puts a lighter touch on the three-note repetition, and
uses the idea for its spinning impetus rather than expounding it as a
thematic shape in itself. Then, more generally, there is the vast difference
in harmonic awareness, which makes questions of motivic correspondence
irrelevant.
To hear the Beethoven after the Mehul was to be confronted by a monument
after an ink sketch, and for that demonstration of how and why Beethoven
towers, the comparison was worth making.
Nothing uncommon so far at the Met, where the season's first offerings range
from a splendid Tales of Hoffmann, through an uneven Falstaff with old
troopers among the merry wives (Mirella Freni, Marilyn Horne), to a
depressing Madam ButterflyOffenbach opera is being presented in a new,
longer conflation of the old Choudens score with the Oeser edition, and with
a new set by the production's designer, Gunther Schneider-Siemssen, for the
Venetian act: a view out from something very like the Ca d'Oro, onto the
Grand Canal and a duly passing gondola, all very much in keeping with the
visual extravagance of the rest of the show. What is lacking is control of
movement and posture and interaction among the principals. Instead, four
great animals of the stage - Placido Domingo, Carol Vaness, Susanne Mentzer
and Samuel Ramey - are pretty much allowed to get away with murder.
Domingo portrays Hoffmann as a man anxious to catch up withe the creatures
of his own imagination, tugged on a tight wire between reality and desire.
Something of this may come out of a technical care, a manoeuvring of his
voice through the nasal sound of French, but the excellent effect is a
watchful reserve, overcome in moments of glorious abandonment, especially in
the third act. Vaness thoroughly enjoys the ironies of projecting herself as
a singing machine in the first act, and goes on to show a dignified
sensitivity as Antonia and a lusciousness as Giulietta. Mentzer as
Nicklausse is spectacularly good, singing with a winning enthusiasm and
freedom; Ramey links all the demands of the piece to a solid thrust of vocal
power, a steady glare. The orchestra under James Levine, both here and in
Falstaff, are luxuriously assured.
Not so their colleagues at City Opera, who labour through Busoni's Doktor
Faust in what is that opera's first New York staging. This is not a happy
debut for a famously challenging work. It looks consistently grim, the
entire action being played behind a screen, whose function is to interleave
the scenes between pages and diagrams from magical treatises (shades of
Prospero's Books), but which disastrously separates and occludes the stage
from the audience. William Stone as Faust - at once sure and insatiable,
majestic and troubled by dreams - deserves more prominent exposure. So does
Michael Rees Davis as Mephistopheles, triumphing against his better, lyrical
inclinations, and Eva Zseller as the Duchess of Parma, warmly conveying the
piece's only aria.
