FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (5):
Dawn's early light? - In the final quarter of 1991 only eight countries
covered by the FT-A World Indices produced a positive return. Yet in the US,
was that . . .

THEY SAY it is darkest just before the dawn. And just before Christmas,
international strategists had to decide whether a new light was dawning for
equities, or whether a seasonal surge was merely punctuating a period of
gloom.
The US Federal Reserve had greeted the winter solstice with a full
percentage point cut in the discount rate to 3.5 per cent on Friday,
December 20. By the close on Friday, January 3, the Dow Jones Industrial
average had posted 10 consecutive rises, for a gain since the rate-cut of
9.9 per cent.
Other markets followed. Tokyo, where the Bank of Japan cut the official
discount rate by half a point to 4.5 per cent on December 30, was more
hesitant, but accumulated a 9.3 per cent gain in the Nikkei average in the
six working days to January 5.
The response was more modest in Europe, where the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index
posted a gain of just 3 per cent in the two weeks following the Fed cut, in
spite of a rise of 6.1 per cent over the same period in the heavily weighted
UK market.
Meanwhile, the fourth quarter of 1991 had carried echoes of the third. In
October-December, only nine of the 24 countries covered by the FT-Actuaries
World Indices produced a positive total return in sterling terms; in
July-September 1991, only eight did so.
Overall, global equities registered deficits of 0.7 per cent and 2.2 per
cent respectively in the third and fourth quarters of 1991. The year had
fallen into two clear halves, with the whole of 1991 producing a positive
total return of 23.5 per cent.
In the last quarter, it would have been wise to be out of Japanese equities,
Nordic Europe and the UK. For the full year, the best returns came from
Mexico and the US in North America; senior non-Japanese markets, such as
Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore, in the Pacific; and South Africa.
And what of 1992? Pick your expert, and you are likely to be told to be wary
of the burgeoning Wall Street market (priced at the end of 1991 on p/e
ratios of 25.2 for 1991 and 19.4 for 1992, according to UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
which prefers continental Europe, followed by the UK and Japan). But you
will also hear of top-ranked analysts, such as Elaine Garzarelli, of Lehman
Brothers, who were vociferously bullish of US equities at the turn of the
year.
On Japan, Baring Securities talks of both bull and bear points,
question-marks over economic recovery prospects, and the hurdle for share
prices that a p/e of, say, 37 presents nowadays; but it still postulates a
total return of 18 per cent for equities this year.
Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, was dismissive of the Tokyo market
towards the end of last year, expecting European equity markets to be the
best relative performers in 1992, the US next and Japan the worst. 'New lows
in stock prices in Tokyo in early 1992 would be our forecast,' said Barton
Biggs, its global allocation specialist, in New York on December 18.
This scenario would present a problem for UK fund managers in particular.
They are being asked to recognise that the UK is now part of the European
bloc, that convergence in equity performance with continental markets must
be a consequence of this, and that the spread of geographical risk will
require a new approach.
According to the convergence theory, when they look for global
diversification in the 1990s, UK fund managers should be looking at other
continents. Ironically, it is other European countries which have been the
focus of their overseas attention in recent years.
