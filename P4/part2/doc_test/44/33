UK GILTS dropped nearly a point but recovered to end slightly higher, due to
a short squeeze in the futures market.
However, traders reported little buying on the lows, with international
investors deterred by sterling weakness and sentiment subdued by the
inflation spectre. Gilts are still 'trading on far too optimistic an outlook
on inflation,' said Mr Nigel Richardson, head of international bond research
at Yamaichi, who sees further downside for gilts.
Expectations of an auction announcement by the Bank of England today also
dampened interest in the cash market. Opinion remains split on the likely
maturity of the issue, with some traders betting on 2004 but others calling
for ultra-long dated debt.
FRENCH government bonds ended the day mixed, with 10-year bonds slightly
higher but 30-year bonds lower.
Traders remain frustrated by the uncertain outlook for French interest-rate
easing and were little surprised by the Bank of France's decision to leave
its 6.75 per cent repo rate unchanged at yesterday's open-market operation.
The key event today will be the release of gross domestic product data,
which are expected to show a 0.2 per cent decline in the second quarter.
DANISH government bonds eased about  1/4 point despite the central bank's
latest rate cuts. The Bank of Denmark cut its key deposit rates to 8.75 per
cent from 9.25 per cent and its two-week repo rate to 9.5 per cent from 10
per cent. While the Danish krone firmed on the news, 10-year bonds dropped
by more than  1/2 point before recouping some of their losses.
According to Mr Richard Gilhooly, international economist with Kidder
Peabody, liquidity pressures prevented the rate cuts from feeding into money
market rates, which remain above 10 per cent. This means that it is
expensive for traders to finance bond positions.
Traders reported a large seller of 10-year bonds in London, which further
depressed prices.
GERMAN bonds were less volatile but outperformed most other markets, with
the bund contract ending  1/4 point higher on a late squeeze in the futures
pits. Sentiment was also boosted by the Bundesbank's latest monthly report.
While the central bank reaffirmed its cautious easing stance, it said money
supply growth was set to slow. Analysts also welcomed its statement that
western German inflation rose by 2.5 per cent on a three-month annualised
basis.
JAPANESE government bonds eased again, mainly over disappointment that the
government's latest fiscal package was not accompanied by a cut in the 2.5
per cent official discount rate. Analysts expect the Bank of Japan to
monitor the currency's reaction to the package for a while before easing,
but most expect the cut to be imminent.
US Treasuries continued to trade in a volatile fashion yesterday morning,
posting modest early gains at the long end of the market before selling in
the afternoon pushed longer-dated yields back above 6 per cent.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/16 at 103
11/32 , yielding 6.003 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/16 , to yield 3.841 per cent.
The day's economic news - slow August industrial production growth, a small
increase in weekly jobless claims and a narrowing in the trade deficit - was
mostly bullish for bonds, but given the market's uncertain, nervous mood,
the data had little impact on prices.
Prices opened firmer, buoyed by Wednesday's late rally which all but wiped
out the day's early heavy losses. Yet the initial upward momentum could not
be sustained, and prices see-sawed erratically around midday in the
slipstream of trading on the futures market. By mid-afternoon prices were
firmly entrenched in negative territory, and because of the Jewish new year
holiday, trading was relatively thin, exacerbating the market's volatility.
