FT  05 DEC 92 / Markets: Watching the Weinstock indicator - London Markets

THREE THINGS became clear this week. The US economy is now clearly
recovering. The German economy is unambiguously in recession. And the UK
economy is - finally - off the bottom.
Each of these developments has important implications for the London
markets. The recovery in the US, indicated by a steady flow of economic
statistics over the past week, tells us that fears of a world depression are
misplaced, since you can't have such a party if the Americans wwill not
come.
Just as important, fears that the huge mountain of US debt would
indefinitely muffle the impact of lower interest rates can now be seen as
over-pessimistic - a conclusion that can probably be applied to the UK as
well. If you cut interest rates enough, for long enough, the economy will
eventually recover.
But have Britain's interest rate cuts gone far enough? Real interest rates
in the UK, after all, are still positive. Base rates are three percentage
points higher than the inflation rate; in the US, it took real interest
rates of below 1 per cent for the best part of 1992 to produce these latest
signs of economic health.
That is where Germany comes in. Thursday's economic statistics - a 1 1/2 per
cent fall in west German gnp in the third quarter, and the forecast of a 3
per cent drop in industrial output next year - make it clear that the
Bundesbank will soon have no choice but to cut short-term interest rates. A
three per cent pay deal for the next 18 months, agreed by the steel workers'
union late on Wednesday, will speed the decision, allowing British interest
rates to fall further.
The debate inside the UK government was summed up by one fund manager this
week: 'The Treasury experts think there is going to be a sufficiently large
boost to the economy from devaluation and the cuts in interest rates we've
seen already. But the man in the street does not see it yet, and the
politicians are listening to the man in the street - especially if he's a
back-bencher.' That means, he thinks, that the one-point cut in interest
rates that might be prudent could well turn into a two-point cut before the
man in the street has been fully assuaged.
Cheaper money in the UK will nourish the hesitant upturn now just getting
under way. Green shoots of recovery are examined elsewhere in this issue of
the FT; the chart shows one snapshot, the trend of car sales. Just as
significant an indicator, said one FT-SE company chairman this week, was the
tone of the statement that accompanied GEC's interim results on Wednesday:
if Arnold Weinstock, GEC's deeply cautious boss, is talking so positively of
growth and stimulus, perhaps the worst is really over.
This is the background against which the FT-SE 100 index rose to within six
points of the 2,800 level on Tuesday, closing the day at a new high of
2,792.0. By Friday, there had been some weakening, and the FT-SE 100 closed
at 2,759.4, down 0.7 points on the week.
The performance of these big, internationally-oriented blue-chip stocks is
not necessarily representative of the market as a whole, however: the
FT-Actuaries All-Share index, which contains 651 stocks, is still 1 per cent
or so below its high of 1326.36, reached in May this year.
You can see the pattern clearly in the daily movements of the FT-SE Mid 250,
the 250 shares that lie just below the FT-SE 100 index in size. Between
Monday's open and Tuesday's close, the FT-SE 100 rose by just over 30
points; but the Mid 250 rose only half as much.
That leaves the optimists to think that, although the UK market is no longer
looking particularly cheap on most measures of value, there is still scope
for more unwinding of the pessimism that dominated much of the year. That
sentiment may already have vanished as far as blue-chip companies are
concerned; but firm confirmation of economic growth may breathe a little
more life into the second-tier stocks.
After all, even among big companies there is still plenty of bad news
around. This week saw discouraging results from Hanson, Grand Metropolitan
and Bass, and receivership for Rosehaugh, the property developer. There is
scope, in the optimists' view, for a further run-up in share prices as
company chairmen finally start to become more cheerful.
As long as the market doesn't come a cropper on next year's government
deficit, say the pessimists. The need for the government to borrow Pounds
50bn or so in the next financial year will test the limits of the
institutions' cashflow; gilt yields will consequently stay high even if
short-term interest rates stay low.
That will hold down the equity market, since it will make gilt yields more
attractive than those on shares. Heavy government borrowing, and perhaps a
new spate of rights issues, will soak up cash that might otherwise have gone
into equities. Fund managers have little money in reserve: institutional
liquidity in the third quarter was down to 3 per cent, compared with a
long-term average of 5 per cent and a figure of 9 per cent a few years ago.
This debate is leading to estimates for the FT-SE in the early part of next
year that range from 2,700 - implying that the market is now heading down -
to 3,250, a rise of nearly a fifth.
The merits of individual shares play little part in this elaborate calculus,
something that must be giving Alan Sugar, the chief executive of Amstrad,
food for thought this weekend. Since September 23, when Sugar first
mentioned the price he would be prepared to pay for the shares in Amstrad
that he did not already own - 30p - the FT-SE has risen 7 per cent.
Perhaps not surprisingly, the early results of the shareholders' ballot
indicate that Sugar is having difficulty in getting the votes he needs to
achieve the deal. He is hoping for a late flood of support.
