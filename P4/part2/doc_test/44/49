FT  27 SEP 93 / World Bank/IMF Meeting: Theorising on an eastern promise -
An attempt to explain east Asia's dynamic growth

<TEXT>
Bank has proposed a new 'functional' theory of economic growth to explain
the unparalleled economic success of dyn-amic east Asia countries. The
problem in explaining the region's success is that it is not homogenous.
There is no single 'east Asian model': Hong Kong, for example, has followed
some of the most laissez faire policies of any country whereas the
governments of Japan and Korea intervened heavily to promote economic
development.
The new theory (see flow diagram) focuses more on what has to be done to
achieve rapid growth than on who should do what. Countries will do well as
long as they find a way of accumulating assets rapidly, allocating resources
efficiently, and achieving rapid productivity growth by catching up
technologically with advanced economies. All three functions are mutually
reinforcing.
But the theory does not assume that any of these growth functions must be
performed exclusively by the private sector: east Asian economies have used
various mixtures of market incentives and state interventions to achieve
each of these goals.
The bank study says much of east Asia's success reflected its strong
performance on economic fundamentals. Rapid accumulation of capital, for
example, reflected a share of investment in gross domestic product that was
7-10 percentage points higher than in other developing countries.
There was also a strong emphasis throughout the region on accumulating
'human capital' - increases in workforce skills brought about by investment
in education and training. East Asia did more to promote education,
especially at the primary, secondary and technical level, than any other
developing region.
But in keeping with the functional growth theory, the bank notes that east
Asian economies 'went beyond the fundamentals, intervening with varying
degrees of intensity to alter market incentives'. In other words, they
deliberately 'got some prices wrong'. The most successful interventions were
generous subsidies for manufactured exports, the bank says.
In a departure from orthodox economic theories, the functional growth theory
claims that government bureaucrats can sometimes allocate resources as
efficiently as private markets. In Japan and Korea, governments used
non-market 'economic contests' to allocate resources.
For example they would establish elaborate rules under which companies would
compete for a valuable asset controlled by the public sector, such as access
to credit or foreign exchange. The contest would be set up so that the
companies likely to make best use of the resource would win.
'Organising contests is a more complicated way to run an economy than
relying on laissez faire, just as organising party games is more complicated
than providing a level playing field and letting children do as they please.
Laissez faire and free play both work. But a well-run contest, like a
well-run party game, can generate even better results, by providing a focus
for competition and inducing participants to co-operate as they compete,'
the bank writes.
Many economists will recoil at the bank's suggestion that contests run by
bureaucrats can allocate resources as efficiently as free markets. They will
ask how government officials will obtain the information needed to judge
which companies or sectors deserve the rewards, such as subsidised credit.
The bank concedes that the success of contests as an allocative mechanism
depends heavily on the calibre and integrity of the bureaucrats. In most
developing countries rationing of resources by the public sector has failed.
The bank also says that some of the most ambitious interventions attempted
in east Asia, such as industrial policies designed to accelerate a shift
into high-tech sectors, mostly failed. With the possible exception of Japan,
unaided market forces would have brought about the changes sought by
government officials.
The report stresses the region's 'export push' strategy was one of the
principal reasons for its success. The focus on foreign markets promoted
economic efficiency by keeping domestic prices closely in line with
international prices and accelerated the introduction of foreign
technologies. This facilitated rapid increases in productivity.
