claims that values will soon recover

Over the past two years, a hurricane has raged in the UK commercial property
market. Some Pounds 70bn - more than a quarter of the total - has been
knocked off the value of shops, offices, factories and warehouses around the
country.
Now the storm may be abating. 'The property market appears to have reached
its turning point,' says Hillier Parker, a firm of chartered surveyors which
continually monitors the mood of the market.
'The investment market is improving faster than expected,' says another
surveyor, Savills Commercial. 'The sharpest positive movements in the IPD
Monthly Index since October 1989 suggests a return of investor confidence,'
says the Investment Property Databank, a research company.
Bargain hunters are sifting potential acquisitions. 'Conditions like these
come round once or twice in a generation,' says Mr Matthew Oakeshott, a
director of OLIM, a fund management group.
But confidence is fragile. For every bull, there is a bear; and even
optimists qualify their enthusiasm with caveats about the importance of
selecting the right location and tenant. While pockets of retail and
industrial property are looking robust, values of Central London offices are
still falling fast.
The bulls' case rests on the level of property yields, the ratio of annual
income to capital value, which have reached record heights over the past
couple of years. When compared with yields of less than two-thirds their
current level in the early 1980s, this can be interpreted to mean that
property is very cheap. Buyers are further encouraged by signs that yields
have started to fall in the autumn, reflecting the reduction in interest
rates and an improvement in investor confidence.
But those expecting a cyclical rebound may be disappointed. Some
commentators wonder whether the market will ever be quite the same again.
Mr Geoff Marsh, head of Applied Property Research, a research company,
believes that the market is undergoing a fundamental restructuring. 'This is
not a conventional cycle,' he says.
Indeed, the very elevation of yields suggests that the market is in
uncharted territory. For the first time in 30 years, property yields are
converging with long dated gilt yields, according to the Investment Property
Databank.
This is a throwback to the years before inflation became a threat to
investors. In those days, gilts traded at lower yields than property,
because they carried less risk.
Once inflation became a way of life, property became a better bet than gilts
because it held out the prospect of real rental growth.
Now, as in the pre-inflation era, property yields are converging with those
of gilts. This suggests that the prospects of rental growth for property are
barely enough to compensate for the risks, management effort and maintenance
costs of holding property.
In part, it reflects waning support from property's traditional supporters,
the UK institutions. Property, which used to be discussed in the same breath
as equities and gilts, became less important during the 1980s. Disillusioned
with the relatively poor performance of property, fund managers shifted
money into the new option, international equities.
The crash of the last two years has further undermined property's
traditional virtues, stability and counter-cyclical performance. The
difference between the property crash and the equity crash of 1987 was its
extended nature rather than its severity. And far from being
counter-cyclical, the peak of the property market in August 1988 coincided
with the high point of the economic boom.
But the main reason for high yields is visible to anybody who looks out of a
window, especially in London. The surge in construction in the late 1980s,
combined with the recession, has left thousands of 'To Let' boards outside
shops and offices. In the City of London, one of the worst affected markets,
nearly one in five offices is empty.
This surplus space is giving new power to tenants, after decades in which
landlords have dictated terms. The 25-year lease, with upward-only increases
in rents every five years, is seen as restrictive by many large tenants, who
would favour an opportunity to break a lease at 10 or 15 years. 'The only
real way to set a rent is when both parties can walk away from each other,'
says Mr Mike Ruddell, who is head of property at Boots the Chemist.
It may be that this shift in the balance between tenant and landlord lasts
only as long as the surplus space remains on the market. If, however,
shorter leases are here to stay, it will change the nature of property
investment. Instead of tucking away a property like a bond, investors will
need to woo tenants and manage their property more actively to maintain its
value.
Skilled landlords may be able to preserve their rental income, but the
reduced security of the investment will force an increase in yields. In a
recent survey by Chesterton, the chartered surveyors, Japanese investors
believed that yields should increase by at least 1.5 per cent to compensate
for the reduction in a lease from 25 years to 10 years.
Another source of pressure on values is the imbalance between buyers and
sellers. An enormous amount of property needs to find a buyer over the next
few years, if the Pounds 40bn of loans outstanding to the UK property sector
is any guide.
At present, it is not clear where the demand will come from. Many potential
buyers, such as property companies and Japanese investors have retreated,
although their place has been partly filled by new buyers, particularly from
continental Europe. Furthermore, the UK institutions, led by the Scottish
funds, are gradually going back into the market, particularly for retail and
industrial developments.
But it is hard to see the institutions rescuing the over-borrowed property
industry as they did in the last serious property crash.
'In similar circumstances in 1974, pension funds and insurance companies
stepped in to fill the gap. Twenty years later institutional demand for
property assets is no longer so fresh and the size of the problem is a far
greater challenge,' according to Debenham Tewson, chartered surveyors.
The twin depressants of poor investment demand and poor occupier demand will
probably continue to dog the market next year. One forecast by brokers BZW
(who are among the most bearish analysts) suggests that capital values will
fall by another 6 per cent in 1992.
The pessimists believe that a slight hardening of yields will fail to
compensate for a fall in average rents. Economic recovery will not
necessarily feed swiftly into enhanced demand: after the last recession it
took at least four years for a recovery in rents.
So it is premature to call the turn for the property market as a whole. But
this does not mean that individual property buyers are wrong. Both the
difficulty of acquiring good property in a rising market and the different
prospects of various parts of the market make it worth sorting the wheat
from the chaff.
There is a world of difference between a high yielding building let on an
inexpensive rent on a long lease to a financially strong tenant, and an old
fashioned, poorly located building with a financially-stretched tenant.
The best properties, with good, secure income, are in high demand. For
example, industrial property, which commands a high yield, actually rose in
value in 1991. The snag is that this rise in value only applies to a small
proportion of the property market: perhaps as little as 15 per cent of the
typical portfolio, estimates BZW.
That excludes a lot of buildings: old buildings which do not meet the needs
of modern businesses; or new buildings in obscure places which may never
find a tenant.
Even if the eye of the property hurricane has passed, dark clouds still hang
over much of the market.
