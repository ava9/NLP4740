  [Text] Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo yesterday 
called on the People's Republic of China to "exercise restraint 
in discharging their responsibility over fearsome technology" 
and to forego any further nuclear testing after the Maoist state 
conducted another nuclear test at Lop Nor last 10 June. 
  Mr. Romulo made the call on the eve of bilateral talks 
between the Philippines and China to be held today at the 
Department of Foreign Affairs office. Both governments will 
discuss a whole range of bilateral concerns, including Beijing's 
worry on the Philippines' growing relationship with Taiwan. 
  "The Philippines finds this (nuclear test) extremely 
unfortunate and regrettable. Last October, during the United 
Nations General Assembly, the Philippines asked for a moratorium 
on nuclear testing. And because China will be participating in 
the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Regional 
Forum in Bangkok this July, we will hope that they will seize 
and desist from further nuclear testing in this part of the 
world," Mr. Romulo said. 
  As a signatory to the United Nations Treaty on 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the Philippines has 
affirmed to all of the accord's objectives, he said. 
  Mr. Romulo said under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the 
testing of nuclear devices should "cease forever" because it 
"gravely threatens the very existence of the human family." 
  The 10 June incident was China's second nuclear test after 
it 
conducted a previous one in October last year. 
  Mr. Romulo said the incident will seriously undermine the 
negotiations currently taking place in Geneva on a Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty. "It also breaks the current moratorium on 
nuclear testing being observed by other nuclear states," he 
added. 
  The annual bilateral talks between Manila and Beijing will 
be 
chaired by Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino and 
his counterpart from the Chinese foreign ministry. 
  The two panels are expected to discuss political and 
economic 
issues affecting both countries, as well as regional ones like 
the forthcoming ASEAN Regional Forum where China is expected to 
participate. 
  Mr. Romulo, declined to comment on whether Manila's concern 
on China's nuclear testing will be a hotly debated topic during 
the bilateral meet. 
  The two groups are likewise expected to tackle other issues 
like the Philippines' one China policy.
