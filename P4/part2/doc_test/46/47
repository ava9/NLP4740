  [Text] The Government tonight insisted it had no plans to 
test nuclear weapons following the United States' announcement 
of an 18-month extension to its testing moratorium until 
September, 1995. 
  President Bill Clinton's decision was based in part on the 
restraint other nuclear powers have shown in resisting pressure 
to resume testing in response to China's test last October. 
  White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said Mr Clinton was 
concerned about the impact resumed U.S. nuclear tests would have 
on comprehensive ban talks which opened in January. 
  Britain, which has traditionally relied on testing its 
nuclear warheads in the Nevada Desert, said the moratorium 
extension was not unexpected. 
  "We reaffirm we have no intention of testing while the 
United 
States' moratorium continues," said a Foreign Office spokesman. 
  "And we would also reaffirm our commitment to working with 
energy and speed towards the completion of an effective nuclear 
test ban treaty." 
  When President Clinton first slapped a ban on nuclear 
testing in 1992, Britain fiercely resisted the move as three 
tests were planned on Trident warheads "for safety reasons." 
  But the Government has reluctantly accepted that world 
opinion is set against testing and is striving to develop 
computer modelling to simulate the effect of nuclear blasts. 
  The need for testing in any case has eased after the 
Government's decision to scrap plans for a new sub-strategic 
nuclear missile. 
  Instead, Britain is to use a number of Trident missiles 
fitted with single warheads. 
  Thus it is not necessary to develop a new warhead as all the 
Trident missiles -- both strategic and sub-strategic -- will be 
fitted with the same warhead. 
  However, Britain is retaining its capability to design, 
develop and produce new nuclear weapons in the future.
