  [Text] Encouraged by the ratification in Congress of the 
Tlatelolco Treaty, which proscribes nuclear weapons in Latin 
America and the Caribbean, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry has 
decided to intensify the Brazilian Government's participation 
within international organizations to fight the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons. Itamaraty's priority is to expedite the Geneva 
talks aimed at achieving a complete ban on nuclear tests. 
  Itamaraty has instructed the Brazilian negotiators to take 
steps to ensure that the treaty addresses the ban on two fronts: 
on the one hand, to prohibit countries that still do not have 
nuclear weapons from making tests with a view to mastering the 
technology; and on the other, to prohibit countries that have 
already mastered the technology from making tests to develop new 
generations of nuclear weapons. 
  Heading the group of 21 developing countries at the Geneva 
talks, the Brazilian Government believes the treaty on the ban 
of nuclear tests will be concluded early in 1995. Foreign 
Minister Celso Amorim said: "We hope the stumbling blocks 
standing in the way of the agreement will be rapidly removed so 
we may all contribute to having mankind eliminate the nuclear 
threat." Countries like Great Britain, France, and China have 
objected to the ban on nuclear tests at the Geneva talks.
