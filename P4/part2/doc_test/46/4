  [Text] Geneva, March 24 (XINHUA) -- China will not be the 
first to use nuclear weapons against other countries and urges 
other nuclear powers to do the same, a Chinese representative 
said here today. 
  Hou Zhitong, head of the Chinese delegation to the 
Conference 
on Disarmament in geneva, told the conference that "China has 
never shirked its responsibility for promoting nuclear 
disarmament." 
  It "has always stood for the fundamental objective of early 
realization of the complete prohibition and thorough destruction 
of nuclear weapons and has made unremitting efforts and 
important contributions in this regard." 
  "It is known to all that since the first day when it came 
into possession of nuclear weapons, the Chinese Government has 
solemnly declared to the world its unilateral commitment of not 
being the first to use nuclear weapons at any time and under any 
circumstances," Hou added. 
  He pointed out, "China has on many occasions strongly 
appealed to other nuclear weapon states to undertake similar 
commitments and to conclude an international convention to this 
end." 
  He said that in order to promote the process of nuclear 
disarmament and realize the goal of preventing nuclear war, the 
Chinese Government has recently taken further initiatives. 
  On December 23 last year, the Chinese Government formally 
proposed to the United States, the Russian Federation and other 
nuclear weapon states that negotiations be started among the 
five nuclear weapon states to conclude a treaty on the 
non-first-use of nuclear weapons. 
  "It is the view of the Chinese Government that under the 
present international situation, the condition is ripe for the 
five nuclear weapon states to negotiate and conclude such an 
international treaty," Hou said. 
  China believes, Hou said, the conclusion of this treaty will 
significantly reduce the risk of nuclear war and provide 
security to the five nuclear weapon states, especially the small 
and medium- sized ones among them. 
  He added, "it will also improve mutual trust and contribute 
to the prevention of nuclear proliferation." 
  Hou noted that such a treaty will play an important role in 
realizing a comprehensive nuclear test ban and promoting nuclear 
disarmament. 
  He expressed the hope that countries concerned will give 
positive response to China's initiative and start negotiations 
with a view to concluding a treaty on the non-first-use of 
nuclear weapons as soon as possible. 
  Hou said China "also hopes that the five states will join 
together to promote vigorously the negotiation and conclusion of 
an international legal instrument on not to use or threaten to 
use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states or 
nuclear-weapon- free zones, so as to make a decisive 
contribution to freeing mankind from the threat of nuclear war." 
  According to Hou, China has consistently pursued the 
objective of the complete prohibition and thorough destruction 
of nuclear weapons and stood for the realization of a 
comprehensive ban on nuclear weapon tests within this framework. 
  He said, "proceeding from this fundamental position, China 
has always exercised maximum restraint in its nuclear testing." 
  China has the lowest number of nuclear tests among all 
nuclear powers, he said. 
  "China fully understands the sincere wish of most 
non-nuclear 
weapon states for an early conclusion of a comprehensive test 
ban treaty (CTBT), in the belief that such a treaty will 
contribute to the realization of the objective of complete 
prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons," Hou 
said. 
  "In view of the above-mentioned considerations," Hou added, 
"the Chinese Government issued a statement on October 5 last 
year, reiterating its relevant principled positions and 
propositions." 
  The statement emphasized that China supports an early 
conclusion of a CTBT and that it will join other countries in 
the negotiation in an effort to conclude such a treaty no later 
than 1996. 
  "It is our opinion that an appropriate solution of the issue 
of security guarantees to the states parties ought to be one of 
the tasks in the CTBT negotiation. 
  "The CTBT is an international legal instrument with a direct 
bearing on the paramount security interests of its states 
parties," he said. 
  According to Hou, just as correctly provided for in the 
mandate of the ad hoc committee, CTBT should promote the process 
of nuclear disarmament and contribute to the strengthening of 
international peace and security. 
  Therefore, Hou said, "for this purpose, the treaty should 
contain provisions for the states parties with nuclear weapons 
to undertake not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons 
against states parties which do not possess nuclear weapons." 
  "At the same time," Hou said, "it should also provide for 
the 
states parties with nuclear weapons to undertake not to be the 
first to use nuclear weapons against each other." 
  Hou believes that "with all nuclear weapon states 
undertaking 
the above-mentioned obligations, it will add to the substance of 
the CTBT, further the treaty's universality and constitute a 
major contribution to international peace and security."
