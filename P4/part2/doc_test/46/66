  [Text] Beijing, June 12 KYODO -- Japanese Foreign Minister 
Koji Kakizawa suggested Sunday [12 June] China's fresh nuclear 
test could influence Tokyo's future loans to Beijing, Japanese 
officials said. 
  Kakizawa was quoted by a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman 
as telling his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen that Japan has 
always regarded banning nuclear tests as one of the highest 
priorities in the field of disarmament and that it strongly 
urges China not to repeat nuclear testing in the future. 
  The Japanese foreign minister said Friday's nuclear test was 
also regrettable in light of the Japanese Government's 
guidelines, released in June 1992, which state that recipient 
countries of Japan's official development assistance (ODA) 
should promote disarmament, the spokesman said. 
  Kakizawa's remarks suggested that China's failure to stop 
nuclear tests may have a negative impact on Japan's yen loan 
programs from fiscal 1996 and thereafter, the official said. 
  Qian reiterated that China's nuclear tests are the fewest 
among those carried out by world nuclear powers, the spokesman 
said. 
  The Japanese minister was in Beijing mainly to discuss 
measures to cope with North Korea's suspected nuclear arms 
development.
