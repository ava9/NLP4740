  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan voiced regret Friday 
over China's underground nuclear test conducted earlier in the 
day. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said in a 
statement it is "extremely regrettable" that China went on with 
the nuclear experiment despite other nuclear states' moratorium 
and when negotiations on a comprehensive test ban treaty is 
under way in Geneva. 
  Japan strongly urges China to never repeat nuclear tests, 
the 
statement said, and also called on other nuclear countries to 
continue refraining from conducting such tests. 
  The latest nuclear test was the first since last October and 
is believed to have been detonated at China's Lop Nor nuclear 
testing site in western China.
