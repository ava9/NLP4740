Formal United Nations negotiations began yesterday on a comprehensive
nuclear test ban treaty, now supported in principle by all five declared
nuclear weapons states. The treaty, which could be ready in two to three
years, is seen by western governments as an important part of efforts to
prevent nuclear weapons proliferation after the Cold War.
The talks are being handled by an ad hoc committee of the UN Conference on
Disarmament, which has 37 members including the nuclear weapons states - the
US, Russia, China, Britain and France. On the first day of its session
yesterday, the conference gave the committee a formal mandate to 'negotiate
intensively' a universal and 'effectively verifiable' test ban treaty.
In a message to the conference, President Bill Clinton called for the
negotiation of a treaty 'at the earliest time'.
Mr John Holum, director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said
yesterday a comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT) was 'an immediate priority'
for the US administration, which has made the fight against nuclear weapons
proliferation a central foreign policy concern. Non-nuclear weapons states
see the CTBT as a test of the nuclear powers' commitment to
non-proliferation and disarmament.
One reason for the US policy reversal on testing is the belief that a CTBT,
or progress towards one, will help persuade developing countries to extend
and strengthen the bedrock Non-Proliferation Treaty when it comes up for
renewal next year.
Separately, the US is opposing Iraq's admission to full membership of the UN
disarmament conference, though it says it will not oppose the inclusion of
North Korea.
