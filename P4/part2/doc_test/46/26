  [Text] Almaty, 27 Apr (XINHUA) -- Upon concluding his tour 
of four Central Asian countries, State Council Premier Li Peng 
held a news conference this afternoon at the state guesthouse 
where he was staying. He answered reporters' questions on the 
results achieved during the trip, Sino-Russian relations, 
China's stand on nuclear testing, China's nationalities policy, 
and other issues. 
  First of all, Premier Li Peng said: The current Central 
Asian visit is the first by a Chinese head of government since 
China established diplomatic relations with the four countries. 
"During the visit, I held fruitful [fu you cheng guo di 1381 
2589 2052 2654 4104] talks with the leaders of the countries in 
question, and enhanced mutual understanding. In my opinion, the 
visit has been successful." 
  At the request of a China Central Television Station 
reporter, Li Peng made a further assessment of the concrete 
results of the tour. He said: "I had a comprehensive and 
in-depth exchange of views with the leaders of the four 
countries on international issues, the regional situation, and 
bilateral relations." "I found that we had many common points. 
For example, when I discussed China's continuous economic 
development as a result of its implementation of the policies of 
reform and opening up while maintaining social and political 
stability, the leaders of the four countries expressed similar 
views, saying that maintaining domestic stability is of 
paramount importance to carrying out economic reform and to 
developing the national economy. Also, we all want to be on 
friendly terms, and hope to become good neighbors and friends. 
This is also a common point." 
  Li Peng said: "In my speech in Tashkent, I expounded China's 
four basic policies for developing relations with Central Asian 
nations. In Almaty, I also made a six-point proposition on 
developing economic cooperation and trade with various Central 
Asian countries. As far as I know, my speeches won broad 
support and good response from leaders, as well as business and 
media people, in the four countries." 
  He stressed: The signing of the Sino-Kazakh border agreement 
is of great significance. The border issue between China and 
Kazakhstan is left over from history and has remained unsolved 
for a long time. That it is being resolved now is the result of 
joint efforts by the two sides. The document defines the 
boundary between the two countries in legal form. "We hope and 
believe that the lengthy Sino-Kazakh border extending more than 
1,700 km will be one of lasting peace and friendship." 
  Li Peng pointed out: The current visit also has achieved 
substantial results in promoting economic cooperation. 
Accompanying me on my tour are senior officials in charge of 
economics and trade, as well as a number of entrepreneurs. They 
came into wide contact and concluded a set of agreements, 
contracts, and letters of intent with economic, trade, and 
business circles in the four countries, scoring even greater 
successes than had been anticipated. An important achievement 
in this respect is the understanding reached between Chinese and 
Kazakh railways and communications departments on improving and 
strengthening international railway through transportation to 
better solve current problems in railway transit transportation. 
During the latter half of this year, we will invite the 
railways and communications ministers of Russia and various 
Central Asian countries to a meeting in Beijing to further 
discuss this issue so as to make full use of the new "Silk Road." 
  In response to a question about China's so-called 
"intention to fill the vacuum left by the Soviet Union's 
disintegration," Li Peng said: "First of all, I would like to 
state my views on the issue. The newly independent countries 
born of the Soviet Union's disintegration are all sovereign 
states; there is no question of so-called `vacuum.' However, I 
would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that China 
seeks no sphere of influence, politically or economically. 
China has many matters to attend to at home and has no interest 
in filling or intention to fill the so-called `vacuum.' My 
present visit is meant to develop the friendship between China 
and various Central Asian countries, and is not directed against 
any other country." 
  On the Sino-Kazakh border trade issue, Li Peng said: It is 
true that a considerable number of Chinese merchants do business 
in Kazakhstan, with self-employed traders constituting the 
largest number. Generally speaking, they have played a certain 
role in promoting border trade between the two countries. A 
small number of them, however, have colluded with some local 
people in carrying out profiteering activities by selling fake 
and shoddy products. The Chinese Government opposes such 
actions. 
  Li Peng emphasized: We are ready to work with the Kazakh 
Government to draw up relevant laws, regulations, and measures 
to stem this unhealthy tendency and to reduce the negative 
effect on bilateral trade. He noted that trade companies in the 
two countries, especially those with good reputations and vast 
resources, should form the main channel of trade between the two 
countries. 
  In response to a question by a Russian reporter about 
Sino-Russian relations, Li Peng said: "The development of 
Sino-Russian relations following the Soviet Union's 
disintegration has been normal. Rather than being weakened, 
bilateral economic relations and trade have surpassed the level 
during the era of the former Soviet Union. President Yeltsin 
visited China in 1992, and the leaders of the two countries will 
exchange high-level visits this year." He added: "Russia is a 
great nation endowed with abundant resources, vast territory, 
and diligent and intelligent people. I believe that the Russian 
people can surely overcome the temporary difficulties they are 
now encountering so long as they rely on themselves." 
  Asked about China's attitude toward a complete nuclear test 
ban, Li Peng pointed out: Although China is a nuclear country, 
the quantity of its nuclear weapons is insignificant compared to 
those of other nuclear countries. Among the nuclear countries, 
China was the first to propose not to use nuclear weapons first 
and not to threaten nonnuclear countries with nuclear weapons. 
The Chinese Government has always stood for complete 
prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and for 
realizing a complete nuclear test ban within this context. For 
this reason, the Chinese Government holds that reaching a treaty 
on a complete nuclear test ban through negotiations is of 
positive significance. China has stated clearly that it will 
work toward concluding such a treaty in 1996. He said: At the 
moment, China is actively participating in the negotiations 
being held in Geneva regarding such a treaty. 
  Asked by a Kazakh reporter on how China, a multinational 
country, handles nationalities issues and maintains national 
stability, Li Peng said: China's Constitution provides for 
equality for all nationalities. We also have a law on autonomy 
for minority regions. Minority nationalities enjoy political 
rights equal to those of the Han nationality. Areas where 
several minority nationalities live in compact communities are 
experiencing economic development with each passing day, and the 
living standards and cultural levels of their people are 
improving continuously. It can be said that the relations among 
our nationalities are marked by great concord and harmony [shi 
fen he mu he rong qia di 0577 0433 0735 4207 0735 5816 3174 
4104]. 
  Premier Li Peng asked Ismail Amat, state councilor and 
concurrently minister in charge of the State Nationalities 
Affairs Commission who was accompanying him on his trip, to give 
a detailed account of China's nationalities policy. 
  Asked about his talks with President Nazarbayev by a 
reporter, Li Peng said: "Despite my short stay here, we held 
several rounds of talks during which we reached many common 
understandings on bilateral relations and international issues. 
We both agreed that all countries should independently choose 
their own development courses and set their own foreign 
policies, and should not allow other countries to interfere. 
Both sides attach great importance to creating a good 
environment for their national economic construction and oppose 
national splittism. During the talks, Nazarbayev said that he 
upholds the One-China stand and regards Taiwan and Tibet as 
inalienable parts of Chinese territory. Nazarbayev also 
explicitly stated that the Kazakh Government will not allow 
elements of so-called "East Turkstan" to carry out activities 
against China in Kazakhstan, and that it opposes pan-Turkism. 
Nazarbayev briefed me on some of his propositions on Asian 
security. I told him that the Chinese side understands and 
appreciates his efforts to safeguard peace and security in Asia."
