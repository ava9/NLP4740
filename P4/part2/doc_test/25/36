  [Text] Al-Fujayrah, United Arab Emirates, April 2 (AFP) -- 
The Gulf emirate of al-Fujayrah called Saturday [2 April] for 
international help to fight an oil slick which has hit 30 
kilometers (18 miles) of coastline, killing fish and turtles. 
  Al-Fujayrah officials said Saturday that 15,900 tonnes of 
oil 
-- more than twice the initial estimates -- spilled from the 
supertanker Seki after it collided with the tanker Baynunah in 
the Gulf of Oman on Wednesday. 
  International "help is now required to prevent a major 
disaster to the area's beaches and marine life," a al-Fujayrah 
government spokesman said. 
  "Large quantities of oil have come ashore on the beaches 
between Lu'lu'iyah and Ras Qadnah, accompanied by dead fish, 
turtles and other forms of marine life," he said, adding that 
scientists had been sent to investigate the damage. 
  Salvage teams from several oil and shipping companies were 
so 
far working with the UAE coast guard. 
  Al-Fujayrah port officials said Hugh Parker, a pollution 
expert from the London-based International Tanker Owners' 
Pollution Federation, had arrived in the emirate and started 
helicopter flights over the spillage. 
  The anti-pollution firm Fairdeal deployed three skimmers to 
tackle the slick, and operators said later they had collected 
more than 1,500 tonnes (10,950 barrels) of oil. 
  Each of the skimmers can collect 20 tonnes (146 barrels) of 
crude every 30 minutes and salvage experts said more than three 
days would be needed to clear up the slick. 
  "We are focusing on the beach area to prevent pollution, but 
the problem is that the wind is variable and the crude is 
spreading," Fairdeal general manager Captain Michael Sarros said. 
  "So far there is no threat to the desalination plants or the 
nearby Omani coast. But we cannot speculate on the consequences 
right now," he said, adding that the spillage covered around 
eight square kilometres (3.2 square miles). 
  Captain Musa Murad of al-Fujayrah port told AFP that the 
slick covered the stretch of coast north of Khawr Fakkan. 
  "It's a catastrophe. Thirty kilometres of coastline have 
been hit by the oil slick," he said. 
  The al-Fujayrah spokesman said that according to Seki 
officials around 15,900 tonnes of oil was spilled into the sea, 
but the spillage from the ruptured tank had stopped Saturday. 
  First reports said around 7,000 tonnes had leaked. 
  "Our initial hopes of containing the spill were dashed when 
weather conditions altered during the early hours of Friday 
morning moving the slick directly to our shores," he said. 
  The 56,300-tonne Baynunah, built in South Korea, joined the 
Abu Dhabi National Tanker Company (ADNATCO) in 1983. 
  ADNATCO said the tanker was about to head for Kuwait to pick 
a shipment of crude for Japan when it collided with the 
282,000-tonne Panama-registered Seki some 10 nautical miles (17 
kilometres) off al-Fujairah. 
  Port officials in al-Fujayrah daily handle up to 50 tankers 
arriving to load up with fuel by ship-to-ship transfers. 
  The last accident at the port occurred in 1986 when a tanker 
hit a mine during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. 
  In another accident, a fire-gutted supertanker barred from 
port for two weeks will be allowed to dock in the Gulf after it 
has unloaded its oil in the next few days, an official with the 
firm towing the tanker said Friday. 
  The Greek-owned Stolidi, carrying the charred bodies of 18 
Filipinos killed in a March 20 fire, will transfer its 225,000 
tonnes of oil to another ship, an International Marine Services 
official said. 
  "The Stolidi is now in Gulf waters and unloading operations 
may start in two or three days about five to 10 nautical miles 
off the coast of Dubai or Sharjah" in the United Arab Emirates, 
he said.
