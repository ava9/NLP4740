  The general manager of the Chah Bahar free zone said: 
Considering the suitable fundamental resources and the 
accessibility of Chah Bahar Port by way of asphalted roads from 
Zahedan, Mashhad, Sarakhs, and Central Asia, in the near future, 
it will be a major center for economic activities in the region, 
like Dubai. 
  Engineer Sami'i continued: In regards to the developmental 
activities in the Chah Bahar region, with the docks at their 
disposal, the existing warehouses and markets will continue
