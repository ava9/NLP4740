<F P=106> [Article signed Pierre Collet: "Saudia Airlines: The Wings </F>
of Desire"] 
  [Text] After Jedda and Abu Dhabi, and before returning to 
Paris, [Industry, Foreign Trade, and Telecommunications 
Minister] Gerard Longuet stopped off at the Dubai aeronautics 
salon, the third gathering since its creation in 1989. This was 
a particularly timely visit since a number of contracts, civil 
and military, are now on their approach run. 
  The "jumbo contract" will be for the partial renewal of the 
Saudia Airlines fleet, representing some 40 aircraft and worth 
in the region of 20 billion French francs. 
  The Airbus-Boeing race to win the contract will be ruthless. 
After Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and President Mitterrand, and 
before Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, it was Gerard Longuet's 
turn to discuss the deal with Saudi officials. For the 
Americans, President Bill Clinton personally telephoned King 
Fahd to inform him of the importance he attaches to this 
contract. It is true that Boeing, which has had to concede 70 
percent of the market in this region to the Europeans from 
Airbus Industrie, is determined to catch up again. This is all 
the more true since the potential airliner market in the Middle 
East could be worth in the region of $28 billion between now and 
2010. 
  Between 7 and 10 November, the 48 French companies present 
in 
Dubai, out of a total of 450, noticed that competition was 
increasingly severe, with the arrival of newcomers like South 
Africa and Romania. 
  Serge Dassault, president and managing director of Dassault 
Aviation [DASA] and chairman of the French GIFAS [French 
Aerospace Industries Grouping], took the opportunity to 
reiterate that "unlike the United States, we are not opposed to 
the transfer of any of our technology." 
  French manufacturers are ready to take off in the military 
market. Dassault Aviation hopes to sell Mirage 2000's, and in 
the longer term, Mirage 2000-5's, which Taiwan has expressed an 
interest in purchasing. 
  Eurocopter, a subsidiary of Aerospatiale and DASA, which has 
already sold 190 helicopters in the Gulf, would like to sell 
some fifteen Panthers to the United Arab Emirates, to compete 
with the British Lynx. The Cougar is also being offered to 
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in competition with the American 
Blackhawk. 
  Lastly, Matra has sold the Mistral missile to Saudi Arabia, 
the Emirates, and Qatar. The company, headed by Jean-Luc 
Lagardere, is in the final stage of negotiations with Kuwait and 
Oman. 
  The coming year 1994 will reveal whether or not France has 
found takers for a share of this arsenal.
