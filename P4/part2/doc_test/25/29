  [Text] Abu Dhabi--The UAE's [United Arab Emirate] crude oil 
revenues in 1993 dropped by 1.766 billion dirhams [UD] (about 
$600 million) to UD51.350 billion ($13.99 billion) relative to 
its crude oil revenues in 1992, which totaled UD53.116 billion 
($14.5 billion). This drop is attributed to the decline in crude 
oil prices that occurred in the second half of 1993. 
  The UAE's crude oil revenues in 1993 constituted 39 percent 
of its gross product, which totaled about UD131.6 billion. 
  The Planning Ministry, in preliminary estimates published 
yesterday on economic developments in the UAE in 1993, stressed 
that the decline in oil revenues was accompanied by an increase 
in the non-oil sectors' share of gross product, which totaled 
UD80.310 billion ($21.88 billion), compared to UD77.047 billion 
($20.99 billion) in 1992. 
  Most of the oil revenues in the UAE go to the Emirate of Abu 
Dhabi. 
  According to 1992 estimates, the oil sector in each of the 
emirates contributed the following to the UAE's domestic 
product: Abu Dhabi, UD43.541 billion; Dubai, UD8.394 billion; 
al-Shariqah, UD10.061 billion; Ra's al-Khaymah, UD120 million. 
  Of all of the emirates, Abu Dhabi's oil output contributes 
the most to the GDP. The Planning Ministry states that Abu 
Dhabi's gross product rose to UD81.692 billion in 1993, compared 
to UD80.979 billion in 1992 and UD79.9 billion in 1991, despite 
the drop in oil prices. 
  The gross product of the Emirate of Dubai rose to UD31.200 
billion in 1993, compared to UD30.729 billion in 1992 and 
UD28.967 billion in 1991. 
  The gross product of the Emirate of al-Shariqah rose to 
UD10.322 billion in 1993, compared to UD10.194 billion in 1992 
and UD9.616 billion in 1991. 
  The gross product of the Emirate of 'Ajman rose to UD1.602 
billion in 1993, compared to UD1.562 billion in 1992 and UD1.489 
billion in 1991. The gross product of the Emirate of Umm 
al-Qaywayn rose to UD873 million in 1993, compared to UD852 
million in 1992 and UD800 million in 1991. 
  The gross product of the Emirate of Ra's al-Khaymah rose to 
UD3.941 billion in 1993, compared to UD3.860 billion in 1992 and 
UD3.655 billion in 1991. The gross product of the Emirate of 
al-Fujayrah rose to UD2.030 billion in 1992, compared to UD1.987 
billion and UD1.788 billion during 1992 and 1991 respectively. 
  The UAE's GDP in 1993 rose to UD131.660 billion, compared to 
UD130.163 billion in 1992. 
  The UAE Planning Ministry stated that the different 
production sectors recorded varying degrees of development. The 
most salient development was the drop in the value of the output 
of the extraction (crude oil) industries to UD51.350 billion in 
1993, compared to UD53.116 billion in 1992. However, the value 
of the output of the other extraction industries rose to UD369 
million, compared to UD355 million in 1992. 
  The share of manufacturing industries rose to UD10.891 
billion, compared to UD9.942 billion in 1992. During the same 
period, the share of the electricity and water sector rose from 
UD2.869 billion to UD2.961 billion; that of the building and 
construction sector rose from UD11.125 to UD11.582 billion; that 
of the wholesale and retail trade and hotel sector rose from 
UD13.020 billion to UD13.382 billion; and that of the transport, 
storage, and communications sector rose from UD7.167 billion to 
UD7.390 billion.
