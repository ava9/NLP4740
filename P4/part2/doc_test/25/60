Abu Dhabi, the biggest oil producer in the United Arab Emirates, yesterday
agreed to double its gas exports to Japan, Reuter reports from Dubai.
The Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Company signed an agreement with Tokyo
Electric Power to export 5m tonnes of liquefied natural gas a year over the
next 25 years.
Adgas said the signing in Abu Dhabi formalised a 1990 accord between the two
companies. The exports will begin in 1994, when expansion of Abu Dhabi's
liquefied gas plant on Das Island is completed.
