Dubai is in the middle of a hotel construction boom. Five luxury hotels,
bringing a further 2,000 rooms on stream, are under construction with
scheduled openings from next month to the end of 1993.
This is quite apart from plans for 37 two-star hotels and a proposal to
build two extensive tourist villages, each with full recreational
facilities. Travellers are already almost spoiled for choice with more than
8,500 existing rooms in four- and five-star hotels, and a present total of
173 hotels.
Standards are generally very high and the service is excellent. Vying for
custom in an already highly competitive sector produces some innovative
marketing. Promotions occasionally verge on the bizarre - such as the
Sheraton's plan to stage speed-boat racing up and down the Creek in central
Dubai.
In addition to a non-stop round of specialty food promotions, theatrical
productions, international bands, entertainers and exhibitions, the hotels
are also active in sponsoring and staging a host of sporting events.
They also serve as 'community centres' and are meeting-places for business,
evenings out, or just a coffee between friends, fulfilling a role rarely
played to the same extent in other societies.
Architectural students may also find the lobbies useful for a study of
building design and interpretation. The foyers, encompassing every
imaginable style from baroque, through Arabesque to art deco, or a pastiche
of several unlikely combinations, can be both awesome and entertaining. Even
allowing for widely divergent tastes, visitors cannot but admire the
ingenuity and often audacity of the architects who have been given free rein
with their creative talents.
The Sheraton has clearly set out to impress. Triangular in shape to afford
views over the Creek, its futuristic atrium is seven storeys high - the
levels cordoned off with railings, in changing colours to break the
starkness. Mainly open plan, there is no cosiness or privacy. A fountain
arrangement is cleverly executed. It starts with a gentle trickle and
descends through three floors and two waterfalls to end in a torrent.
The Ramada hotel makes a bold statement with its balconied foyer. One wall
of the atrium is composed of a 13-storey stained glass window - the tallest
such feature in the world at 135 feet high. In the Mogul style it
incorporates 28 species of flowers and shrubs in graduated colours and
requires 300 fluorescent tubes for illumination. On the opposite wall are
external cable-car lifts which descend into the coffee shop and ascend at
speed to afford a view of the glass mural.
Oozing opulence, the Royal Abjar Hotel is preparing its lobby for opening in
October. The pink marble floor uses geometric shapes, repeated throughout
the hotel, and is overlooked by a series of walkways and hanging gardens to
balance the sheer size of the foyer. External lifts with glass doors descend
into the lobby from where the floor-to-ceiling aquarium can be seen.
All the five-star hotels provide spacious and comfortable bedrooms with all
the trimmings. Each hotel offers its own little extras - such as the Tiara
Club for female executives at the Royal Abjar - but in essence they are all
excellent, with every useful facility. Catering largely for business
travellers, all the five-star hotels provide a range of fax, computer,
typing and secretarial services, although the services may not be 24-hour
unless requested in advance.
Standard rooms do not usually have plugs for modems but the business centres
can transmit any documents or material using their IBM-compatible computers.
Executive suites are typically provided with a personal fax but the
telephone bills can be expensive. Oddly it is less expensive to call the US
and England (Dh6 to Dh7.5 for three minutes) than France, Germany or Hong
Kong (Dh10 to Dh13).
Dubai is small and all areas are easily accessible, so hotel locations are
more a matter of preference than necessity. All the main establishments have
their own swimming pools, health clubs and tennis courts and offer a range
of leisure and other sports facilities. Many hotels provide courtesy buses
to their own beach clubs or one of the resorts. A list of hotels appears in
the guide.
The 'holiday' hotels include the Chicago beach hotel, the Dubai Marine,
Metropolitan and Hilton hotels which all have their own beach clubs, and the
Jebel Ali Hotel. The peak season for winter-sun seekers is October to April
but even then the expansive, clean sands are uncrowded.
The Chicago Beach is predominantly a self-contained tourist resort,
especially popular with Scandinavians and Germans for its watersport
facilities. The other hotels cater for a more mixed clientele of business
visitors, conference delegates and tourists.
The Hatta Fort hotel, popular for weekend breaks and out-of-the-way
conferences, nestles in the mountains some 100km from Dubai.
Surrounded by landscaped lawns, the hotel accommodation is in the form of
Swiss-style chalets, which are somehow not totally incongruous after a stay
in the city. Its lobby is modest by Dubai standards and the hotel features
stone-faced walls built from local rock.
Hotel tariffs start at about Dh580 per night for a five-star hotel and Dh400
for four-star. Prices vary quite considerably and do not usually include
breakfast.
It is worth bearing in mind that a 15 per cent service charge and 5 per cent
municipality tax are added to all hotel bills for any facility, including
meals and telephone calls.
