Unashamedly promoting itself as the last word in luxury, the soon-to-be
opened Royal Abjar Hotel's list of features includes: 'wide door space to
drive in vehicles for product launches.'
This, appearing alongside descriptions of lavish elegance, such as 2,200kg
of crystal chandeliers cascading from the ceiling, illustrates the emphasis
on and the importance accorded to fairs and seminars. Extravagant
furnishings are the jam, conferences and trade promotions are the bread and
butter.
Hotels have carved out their own niche in the market. Attracting a steady
flow of press conferences and business gatherings, the spin-offs include the
provision of catering facilities and accommodation for those attending the
gathering. In April and May there were nearly 300 product launches -
everything from a new nail varnish to the Ford Aerostar compact bus - with
more than half staged in hotels.
Notice boards in hotel foyers make interesting reading and are tantamount to
advertising bulletin boards. In the space of three days, one hotel staged a
seminar on 'Investment in East Germany' held by the Treuhand privatisation
agency, two product launches, a shipping conference, a bankers' business
lunch and a kiwi fruit promotion.
All the main hotels can boast of sizeable display facilities and a variety
of meeting rooms furnished with presentation aids from flip charts,
projectors and videos to, in some cases, electronic voting and translation
services.
In tandem with its increased trading activities, the emirate has developed
the trade promotion and display side to a sophisticated level. A case in
point was Dubai Airport's state-of-the-art Cargo Village and the prestigious
'91 Airshow. The official opening of the freight handling and storage
complex was timed to coincide with the air show in November.
At the very time that the international aerospace industry needed to bring
in cumbersome and expensive aircraft equipment for the high-profile show,
the ribbon for the cargo village was cut. Clearance times through the
freight terminal had been honed down to just 13 minutes and the air show
subsequently went on to put Dubai firmly on the aerospace circuit, third in
size after Farnbrough and Paris. Hotels are already fully booked for the '93
Dubai Airshow.
Similarly, the defence exhibition staged in January this year attracted a
lot of interest from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the Gulf crisis still fresh in
their memories. Equipment such as the Starbust laser-guided anti-aircraft
missile was on display alongside armoured vehicles, weaponry and
surveillance systems. Sales and contract figures were not readily
forthcoming but were respectively estimated as being 'large' and 'good.'
Leading the way in both exhibitions and conferences is the World Trade
Centre (WTC). Putting itself on the map was accomplished in physical terms
by virtue of its size - at 39 storeys it is the tallest building in the
Arabian Gulf. Making its mark on the international exhibitions circuit has
been achieved by a combination of efficiency and sheer audacity on the part
of the centre's dynamic management team.
Epitomising the free trade spirit of the emirate, the centre pulled off the
Middle East International Motor Show in record time and against all the
odds. In November 1991, two years ahead of schedule, the Dubai motor show
became international and succeeded in attracting manufacturers such as BMW
which had declined to exhibit their 5-series Touring at London's Motorshow.
Forlorn exhibitors, who had moped around at the Frankfurt, London and Tokyo
motor fairs, depressed by strikes, recession and stock market falls, brought
their vehicles to Dubai and found a booming market and sales. The trade
centre then did it again with the Watersport and Powerboat show in February.
May saw the 'Britain in the Gulf 92 ' exhibition, the largest mounted in the
Arab World with 250 British companies displaying their products. Exhibitors
such as Starlite Chandeliers, sold their entire stock before the exhibition
started and notched up a Pounds 115,000 order on the first day. FEL
International negotiated a Pounds 3.5m order for four straddle cranes.
The calender of exhibitions and conferences at the centre now extends to 40
a year and encompasses every sector from oil and gas to computing and
camels, fashion and overseas investment. The WTC is a member of the World
Trade Centres Association and is supported by its own residential apartments
complex and on-site hotel, the Hilton. The three exhibition halls with
adjacent external display areas provide a total of 14,509 square metres of
internal floor space plus 6,120 square metres for outdoor exhibiting, all
backed by an array of administrative and management services.
The WTC has also established a management development centre offering a
range of courses in management and results-oriented training, in addition to
an Arabic language centre with a range of general and private courses at all
levels.
Succumbing to the jam side of the conferences business, the centre has set
up the World Trade Club on the top floor of the tower. Its membership list
reads like a Who's Who of the region's senior businessmen and, like the
Royal Abjar Hotel, it oozes luxury with panelled dining rooms on different
themes.
A recent conference entitled the 'Travel Trade Forum' drew participants from
leading hotel chains, international airlines and global marketing agencies.
The active management of the World Trade Centre, rubbing shoulders with
tourism ministers and senior advisers and mingling with speakers from the
Economist Intelligence Unit and the City University Business School, seems
to have followed the line of one of the conference's workshops: 'Even if
you're on the right track, you'll get run over if you just sit there.'
