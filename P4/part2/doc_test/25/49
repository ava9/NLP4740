  [Text] Abu Dhabi, May 1 (AFP) -- A United Arab Emirates 
(UAE) coastguard was wounded in a clash when a boat bringing in 
illegal immigrants was intercepted in the Gulf, the official 
news agency WAM reported on Sunday. 
  Coastguards had to call in air force reinforcements when 
they 
came under fire from the boat on Friday off al-Sha'm, in the 
northern emirate of Ra's al-Khaymah, the agency quoted the 
Interior Ministry as saying. 
  "A clash took place between the coastguard patrol and the 
boat, but after an aircraft intervened the boat and all the 
people on board were seized," said acting border- and coastguard 
chief Salih al-Shalwah. 
  He did not say where the boat came from or identify those on 
board. 
  However, police records show most of the illegal immigrants 
captured over the past two decades came from Iran, Pakistan and 
Afghanistan. They came in search of jobs in the oil-rich Gulf 
state. 
  Al-Shalwah gave no further details of the incident, but said 
the wounded soldier was taken to a Dubai hospital and his 
condition was satisfactory. 
  "It is not the first incident of its kind," a Ra's 
al-Khaymah 
coastguard official told AFP by telephone. 
  "There have been many cases involving clashes with 
infiltrators," he added, but refused to reveal the nationalities 
of those involved in Friday's incident.
