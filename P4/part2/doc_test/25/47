Some 20 international companies have submitted pre-qualification documents
for a prestige contract to build a 50,000 sq metre mosque in Abu Dhabi. The
closing date is April 11, Robin Allen writes from Dubai.
The marble-and-granite structure will be called the Grand Mosque of Sheikh
Zayed Bin Sultan II, after the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the
United Arab Emirates. Estimates put the total cost at some Dh500m (Pounds
91m).
Tractebel Al Khaleej was recently awarded the consultancy contract for the
Taweela 'C' project by the Abu Dhabi water and electricity department, which
is building a new power generation and water desalination plant at Taweela,
near Abu Dhabi city.
