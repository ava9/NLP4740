  [Text] In fighting drugs, unilateral action is insufficient 
for dealing successfully with the phenomenon. Therefore, 
international cooperation is being sought as the only means of 
consolidating an effective barrier against a supranational type 
of problem. This statement was made yesterday by Raul Campos 
Rabago, commissioner of the PGR's [Office of the Attorney 
General of the Republic] [National] Institute To Combat Drugs. 
He was participating for the second time in the sessions of the 
Inter-American Committee for Control of Drugs and Drug Abuse 
[CICAD], being held in Mar del Plata, Argentina. 
  Addressing representatives from North, Central, and South 
America, and the Antilles, the Mexican official specified 
Mexico's achievements in this respect during 1993, describing 
them as a record in the battle against the drug traffic. He 
reported confiscations of nearly 46 tons of cocaine, 129 kg of 
opium gum, 27 kg of morphine, 26 kg of heroin, and a ton of 
poppy seed. 
  He also cited approximately six tons of marijuana seed, 500 
tons of marijuana, 23,000 units of psychotropic substances, more 
than 2,000 land vehicles, 24 aircraft, and six vessels seized. 
Moreover, five clandestine laboratories for processing and 
refining various illicit substances or narcotic precursors were 
dismantled. Over 200,000 marijuana plantations and approximately 
160 poppy crops were seized as well; and 18,000 nationals and 
75,000 foreigners involved in committing crimes against health 
were captured. 
  In the juridical-penal area, Campos Rabago remarked that the 
most significant action taken in the context of the national 
antidrug policy was the amendment to the regulations of the 
Organic Law for the Office of the Attorney General of the 
Republic. It created the National Institute To Combat Drugs, 
assigning a sector of the Federal Judicial Police to that 
decentralized agency, to achieve an ethical, professional police 
force devoted exclusively to fighting the drug traffic. 
  At the same time, he gave a reminder that, early this year, 
several articles of the Federal District Penal Code pertaining 
to both the common jurisdiction and the entire republic were 
amended, given additions, or repealed. Including Articles 193 to 
199, and 201, regulations pertaining to crimes against health 
were established, to provide for more severe punishment. 
Addressing the representatives of the CICAD's 24 member nations, 
and those of the observer states, he stressed that all the 
national and international action taken to combat drugs is 
reducing the power of the criminal associations. 
  Nevertheless, he noted that, to deal with the problem with 
modern, really effective methods, "it seems essential to us that 
all countries have a juridical frame of reference, a national 
program, and a central coordinating and executive organ. Hence, 
we take the liberty of urging those who have not yet done so to 
ratify and, if pertinent, sign the United Nations Convention of 
1988 against the illicit trafficking of drugs and psychotropic 
substances." 
  He explained that, with that expedient, "many of our nations 
have taken steps to harmonize their legislation, which is an 
essential factor for dealing with the problem on a regional and 
international scale, in a coordinated manner. This will make it 
possible to accrue increasingly positive results in this battle, 
which can be won only through the political will and concerted 
action of all nations." 
  Raul Campos Rabago emphasized that, in the case of the 
Mexican experience, "our country has always stressed that the 
causes and not merely the effects of the drug traffic must be 
attacked." In this forum, he reiterated Mexico's conviction that 
it was imperative to promote alternative development of 
underprivileged rural areas, where extreme poverty has fostered 
the illicit crops as a means of subsistence. 
  He continued: "In my country, great importance is attached 
to 
suitable planning and regional coordination of the strategies 
for combating drugs and drug addiction. The aim is to reduce 
consumption and, hence, the demand for and illicit trafficking 
of drugs and psychotropic substances, as well as the associated 
activities. 
  "It is highly desirable to promote the establishment of 
coordinated action in the interior and among the various 
geographical areas comprising the American Continent, always 
based on the principle of respect for national sovereignty and 
jurisdictions."
