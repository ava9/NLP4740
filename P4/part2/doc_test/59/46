  [Text] Mexico, Federal District, 4 May (EFE) -- Mexican 
Judicial Police have seized 5.8 tons of marijuana worth $36 
million, a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office (PGR) 
reported on Wednesday. 
  The operation was conducted in La Paz, capital of Baja 
California Sur State, some 1,250 kms northeast of Mexico City. 
According to the information available, the seizure was made at 
a La Paz loading terminal during the inspection of a trailer 
that had come from the port of Mazatlan, Sinaloa State, one of 
the states with the highest incidence of narcotrafficking. 
According to the driver, the truck was bound for the 
California, (United States) border, where the drug would have a 
commercial value of $36 million. 
  The PGR is holding the truckdriver pending a decision on any 
penal action against him for crimes against the public health. 
It has also begun investigating the prisoner's plan and 
possible accomplices as well as the place of origin and the 
destination of the stupefacient.
