  [Text] During a news conference in the presence of the 100 
members of the Inter-American Defense College's [CID] Class 33 
currently visiting Venezuela, Brigadier General Alvaro Rafael 
Barboza Rodriguez, Joint Staff operations director, reported 
that between 50 and 60 tons of various drugs circulate through 
Venezuela annually. 
  The CID director and U.S. Army Major Gen. James Harding said 
that the students come from 14 countries on the continent. CID 
courses last 10 months, beginning in July. "This is an 
opportunity to exchange views and get to know these countries a 
little better. It is a very simple project." he said. 
  In halting Spanish, Maj. Harding said that according to data 
supplied by CID and the Inter-American Defense Board, which he 
leads also, terrorism and drug trafficking are the major threats 
to the continent's security. "We should strive jointly to find a 
solution to the drug trafficking problem, which goes beyond 
borders and helps the entire world. The cooperation of all 
governments is required," he said. 
  In the morning Harding paid a courtesy visit to Defense 
Minister General Rafael Montero Revette. The CID members will 
fly to Colombia on Thursday. 
  Gen. Barboza, former commander of the Venezuela unit which 
operated in Honduras and Nicaragua on pacification duties, was 
selected by the Defense Ministry to make a general assessment of 
the "military situation" in Venezuela. He described as a threat 
the use of Venezuela as "a springboard for the traffic of drugs 
to Central America and their final destination, the United 
States." An estimate of the quantity of drugs circulating 
through Venezuela was made by the National Guard. "Only 10 
percent of this quantity is seized. This gives an idea of the 
seriousness of the problem," he said. He also reported on the 
discovery of marijuana and coca plantations in the Perija 
Mountains and areas close to the Colombian border. Money 
laundering "has been detected essentially in four areas: 
Tachira; Zulia, near Maicao; Caracas, through real estate 
operations; and the country's eastern region," he said. 
  He recalled that the most successful years in the 
counternarcotics struggle were 1991 and 1992, when 11.981 tons 
and 12.681 tons, respectively, were confiscated. In 1993 the 
drug seizure level again was close to three tons, a figure 
similar to that of 1990. Cocaine is the most often confiscated 
drug. Next comes marijuana, 400 kilos of which are seized 
annually. "The fact that heroin is entering the local market 
again is worrisome," he said. 
  The UN believes this is a worldwide problem. The number of 
involved countries has risen from 64 in 1990 to 138 in the first 
half of 1993. 
  Gen. Barboza announced that this year the Armed Forces will 
put two flight control radar sites in operation. One of them 
will be located in Falcon State and cover the country's central 
and western region. The other, located in Nueva Esparta, will 
serve to monitor flights between the country's central and 
eastern regions. These sites are being installed through 
agreements with U.S. counternarcotics agencies, such as DEA, 
CIA, and others. "These sites will be operated jointly with our 
Armed Forces," he said. 
  This illegal activity can be monitored more by effectively 
by 
observing the flight patterns of the drug traffickers' planes, 
that is to say, speed, altitude, time, and routes, as well as 
the types of planes used. A special overflight program, 
originating in Panama and reaching Peru and Bolivia with 
observers aboard, is being set up. Special surveillance 
operations can be conducted on the request of the Venezuelan 
Government or the U.S. Southern Command authorities.
