ORANGE COUNTY PLAYS CATCH UP ON GOLF COURSES

Orange County mattress magnate Wayne Simmons plans to drive from his Anaheim 
Hills residence to Dana Point every other week this summer to play golf at the 
Links at Monarch Beach, shunning a country club located much closer to his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons, owner of W. Simmons Mattress Co. in Cerritos, says it doesn't bother 
him a bit to fight freeway traffic for 45 minutes and pay the highest green 
fees in Orange County -- $50 on weekdays, $75 on weekends -- to play a 
first-class course with two holes right on the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of people who share Simmons' enthusiasm, and their apparent 
willingness to play golf at nearly any cost is prompting developers to 
transform hundreds of acres of valuable land in Orange County into upscale golf 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
At least 12 new golf courses are being planned or built in Orange County, most 
in conjunction with expensive south county housing developments. Their 
completion will increase the number of public and private courses in the county 
to 44. 
</P>
<P>
The new facilities are billed as premier courses, designed by golfing 
luminaries and architects such as Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Robert Trent 
Jones Jr., Tom Fazio, Tom Weiskopf, Jay Morrish and Ted Robinson. And all will 
cost much more to play than most golfers are accustomed to paying. 
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of golfers and a limited supply of courses has sparked a 
golf course construction spree across the country. Developer interest has been 
stoked by higher fees, which make operating courses more lucrative than in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
Contributing to the boom in Southern California is the ability to use golf 
courses to satisfy open space mandates and the recognition that the presence of 
golf courses will increase adjoining property values. 
</P>
<P>
From 1970 through 1988, the number of golfers in the United States more than 
doubled to 23.4 million from 11.2 million, according to the National Golf 
Foundation. The national golfing population is expected to expand to 30 million 
by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lagged Behind in Construction 
</P>
<P>
The foundation believes that demand is sufficient to support construction of 
400 or more golf courses annually between now and the year 2000. Only 211 new 
courses were opened in 1988. Golf, which seemed to take a back seat to tennis 
as the "in" sport of the early 1970s, is enjoying a resurgence in the 1980s. 
The national tennis population has fallen to 20 million from a peak of 40 
million in the late 1970s, according to the American Tennis Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The change is generally attributed to the aging of America's baby boomers, many 
of whom are now looking for less strenuous forms of recreation that also offer 
social and professional payoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County, with an estimated 214,000 golfers, long has lagged behind other 
areas in construction of new golf courses. National Golf Foundation statistics 
show that in 1987, the county had 4,653 golfers for each 18-hole course. That 
compared to 3,620 golfers per 18 holes statewide and 2,056 golfers per 18 holes 
nationally. California had the fewest courses per capita of any state in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
The demand in Orange County is dramatized by the long lines that form every day 
before dawn outside of pro shops at lower-cost public courses. Early rising is 
a required regimen for golfers who stand in line not to play that day, but to 
make reservations for a week later. 
</P>
<P>
The new courses are expected to attract golfers who want to escape the jammed 
municipal courses and are willing to pay more for some elbow room at the 
upscale facilities. The new courses also claim that they will be a cut above 
most municipal courses in quality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Fees 
</P>
<P>
Gene Krekorian, senior vice president of Economic Research Associates in Los 
Angeles, said no one in Orange County is building the kind of golf course that 
is needed most: those with fees of $10 to $15. Even so, he said, there are 
plenty of golfers who will support the more expensive courses. 
</P>
<P>
By traditional standards, the new courses are certainly pricey. 
</P>
<P>
At the Tustin Ranch Golf Course, an undulating expanse of manicured turf, 
pools, waterfalls and 2,000 trees that is making its debut Monday, golfers will 
be asked to pay $45 on weekdays and $60 on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Charges at Tijeras Creek Golf Course, scheduled to open next summer in the 
developing foothill community of Rancho Santa Margarita, are expected to run 
about $25 on weekdays and $50 on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
And two public golf courses that the Irvine Co. plans to develop along the 
coast just south of Corona Del Mar as part of a resort project are expected to 
top the $50 and $75 fees at the Links at Monarch Beach, currently the county's 
most expensive course. 
</P>
<P>
With fees like these, developers can not only recover all of their development 
costs but also pay for part of the land underlying the course, said Krekorian. 
</P>
<P>
Some developers, however, have no interest in operating golf courses and plan 
to recapture their costs by turning the courses into private clubs and selling 
memberships at prices that would have seemed astonishing only a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Initiation fees for memberships in the new private courses range from $8,500 at 
Pacific Golf Club in San Clemente to $75,000 at Marbella Golf &amp; Country 
Club in San Juan Capistrano. In addition, members must pay monthly dues in the 
hundreds of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the high cost, memberships are selling briskly. Although the golf 
course and clubhouse at Marbella have yet to open, all but 52 of 300 club 
memberships have been sold, said Ken Olson, corporate broker for the 
developers. And at Pacific Golf Club, memberships are being snapped up at a 
rate of 50 a month, according to Bob Hayward, general manager of the 27-hole 
course. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, cities are encouraging the development of public golf courses. 
Jay Pierce, director of land development for an Irvine Co. subsidiary that is 
developing Tustin Ranch, said the Tustin City Council insisted on construction 
of a showcase public golf course as part of the 9,000-home community. 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't have been able to build houses out there if it weren't for the 
golf course," Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Singleton, Tustin's community development director, conceded that 
fees at the new course will be too rich for the blood of some Tustin residents. 
Even so, she said, the city is getting a free golf course that is "far better 
than what the city could afford to construct." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Open Space 
</P>
<P>
Although Orange County planning officials will not let developers substitute 
golf courses for required parkland in planned community developments, they will 
count courses toward general open space requirements. To that extent, the 
courses wind up generating revenue from land that would not be developed 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Jessen, chief of planning and acquisition for Orange County Harbors, 
Beaches and Parks, said the county planning commission has shown "a strong 
interest in golf courses." 
</P>
<P>
Jessen said that in return for giving developers open space credit for golf 
courses, the county in recent years has begun filing deed restrictions to be 
sure that the courses will be retained forever as open space and not later 
converted to housing. 
</P>
<P>
In areas where land proposed for a golf course is flat and easily buildable, 
Jessen said, the county generally gets more open space than it otherwise could 
have demanded from a developer. 
</P>
<P>
But as a rule, golf courses are not built because of the green fees they will 
generate or the open space requirements they will satisfy. Krekorian said the 
most compelling economic incentive is the opportunity to increase the prices of 
lots and homes in surrounding communities, especially those directly 
overlooking the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason they do it is for the real estate premiums that in many cases more 
than make up the cost of the land being used for the golf course," Krekorian 
said. "You can't afford to buy a piece of property and build a golf course and 
(expect to) make money. You need to do it as part of an overall community 
development." 
</P>
<P>
Garth Chambers, developer of the Dove Canyon community in southeastern Orange 
County, figures that his costs for golf course development include $6 million 
for the land, $6 million for construction of the course, $12 million for the 
clubhouse and $3 million to subsidize the private club until it is 
self-supporting. He said that if the state Department of Corporations approves 
his plan to sell 479 golf club memberships for $60,000 each, he will reap a 
very modest profit on his $27 million investment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Water Features 
</P>
<P>
But Chambers said he expects that the private country club atmosphere created 
by the golf course will add 30% to average property values within the 
1,300-home community. 
</P>
<P>
According to real estate sales people, home buyers cherish a view of a golf 
course second only to an ocean view. A home by a fairway often will sell for 
$50,000 to $300,000 more than the same model home just out of sight of the golf 
course, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"If a unit is directly on the golf course, the typical premium is about 20% of 
the base price. So if it were a $400,000 single-family home, it would get a 
$80,000 premium for the course," said Ken Agid, a national real estate 
marketing analyst. 
</P>
<P>
The size of the golf course premium, marketing experts said, also depends on 
whether the golf course is private and has water features. 
</P>
<P>
"If you add water, they will pay an additional premium," said Ted Robinson, a 
Laguna Beach golf course architect who designed the new courses in Santa 
Margarita and Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
"For every dollar spent on waterscapes, we will get $3 to $4 in increased real 
estate values," said Robinson, who specializes in "babbling brooks and 
waterfalls." 
</P>
<P>
At Marbella, sales of lots over the past year have been at least as hot as 
sales of golf club memberships. "We had 215 lots for sale, and they are all 
gone but for five. People love to live on golf courses," said J. Richard (Rick) 
McMichael, president of Fairway Land Co., a Laguna Niguel firm that is creating 
the exclusive golf community with two Bay Area developers. 
</P>
<P>
McMichael noted that home buyers don't seem discouraged by the company's 
warnings that living near a golf course can pose dangers from errant golf 
balls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Essential to Resorts 
</P>
<P>
Even before Coto de Caza has enough golf club members to support one golf 
course, the developer of the fashionable community is planning a second course 
to open in mid-1991. The reason, said John Yelverton, president of the 
California division of Arvida, which is developing the project with Chevron 
Land Development Co., is to provide more golf course settings for more lots. He 
said a golf course view adds $60,000 to $90,000 to the price tag of each 
buildable lot. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does living on golf courses appeal only to golfers. "Typically, 75% of the 
buyers in a golf course-oriented community do not belong to the club or play 
golf," said Agid. "Twenty-five percent of the buyers are attracted by the open 
space and manicured setting, and another 50% by the associated benefits, such 
as the prestige and future real estate values." 
</P>
<P>
Golf courses are deemed essential to south Orange County's bid to become a 
major destination resort area. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarch Beach course is important to the nearby Ritz-Carlton Hotel and will 
be a big draw for two other hotels that are planned on its perimeter. In tandem 
with the new hotel projects, Townsend said, the golf course will be expanded 
and redesigned. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Scheilein, general manager of the Ritz Carlton, said he dearly values an 
agreement that reserves for the hotel half of the Monarch Beach tee-off times. 
"A resort couldn't label itself a resort without a golf course," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Scheilein said, many of his hotel guests are Japanese businessmen who 
are "wild about golf."
