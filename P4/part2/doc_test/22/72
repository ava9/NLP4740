<P>
City Councilman and regional transportation commissioner Gary L. Hausdorfer, in 
possible violation of state law, has failed to disclose income received by his 
wife from a prominent planning and engineering firm that does business in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Records reviewed by The Times also show that Hausdorfer -- who was mayor at the 
time -- voted in September to approve a city contract with a company whose 
subcontractors included the firm that employs his wife. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Hausdorfer said Friday that he was unaware when he voted that 
his wife's employer, The Keith Cos., was authorized in the contract to receive 
$8,100. That vote and his failure to report his wife's income on his 1988 and 
1989 disclosure forms, he said, might have been "mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
"You try to avoid all these things, and life's too short not to," said 
Hausdorfer, who owns a commercial mortgage business. " . . . If I've made 
mistakes, then I'll take the blame. . . . We certainly have nothing to hide." 
</P>
<P>
Hausdorfer's wife, Debora, is director of public affairs for The Keith Cos., a 
firm that does work on behalf of developers and public agencies throughout 
Orange County. She said that she began working for Keith in late 1988 and that 
her duties include efforts to obtain new contracts -- although not in San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
State conflict-of-interest law requires public officials to disclose the 
sources of their income -- including community property income generated by a 
spouse -- and to abstain from governmental decisions that affect those income 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being a councilman since 1978, Hausdorfer also is a member of 
two powerful regional transportation agencies: the Orange County Transit 
District and the Foothill-Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Hausdorfer said that he recently abstained on one matter that came before the 
Foothill Transportation Corridor -- the agency that is building two toll roads 
in eastern Orange County -- because The Keith Cos. had an involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't vote on anything that has their name on it," said Hausdorfer, 44. 
</P>
<P>
The San Juan Capistrano council vote involving the Costa Mesa-based firm came 
in September, at a time when Hausdorfer was serving as mayor. The issue was 
whether to approve a $304,197 contract for a study of how to use 140 acres of 
agricultural land that San Juan Capistrano voters agreed last spring to acquire 
through a $120-million bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
The Keith Cos., which had received earlier city payments for studying the 140 
acres and surrounding properties in the city's northwest area, was authorized 
in the September contract to get $8,100 of the total award. After presentations 
by planners and discussion, the council voted unanimously to approve the 
contract, according to minutes of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"If they (The Keith Cos.) are officially a part of the team, I didn't know it, 
and it wasn't pointed out to me" at the time of the council's vote, Hausdorfer 
said, noting that the bulk of the award went to The Keith French Group, a San 
Clemente firm unrelated to the company that employs Debora Hausdorfer. 
</P>
<P>
Hausdorfer had championed the open-space initiative approved by voters last 
spring. And, The Keith Cos. has been involved in studying that land since at 
least 1988, according to city records. 
</P>
<P>
San Juan Capistrano paid The Keith Cos. $19,081 -- on Aug. 10, 1989, and on 
June 28, 1990 -- for work related to the city's "Northwest Planning Study." 
Records reviewed by The Times also show that, beginning in May, 1987, and 
continuing through October, 1990, San Juan Capistrano paid the firm $109,321 
for other professional services. The council approved all the Keith payments in 
routine "consent calendar" actions. 
</P>
<P>
Hausdorfer, commenting on his not reporting his wife's income on his disclosure 
statements, said that he did not believe he was required to do so because Keith 
was not operating and "located" in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
State law, however, requires officials such as Hausdorfer to disclose such an 
income source if the company is located or has done business within the city, 
according to Jeevan Ahuja, an attorney with the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission. Ahuja said that a company's physical location is irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's the case," said Hausdorfer, "it's easy to amend (the earlier 
disclosure statements) and I'll check with the FPPC and the city attorney." 
</P>
<P>
The Keith firm has been active with a number of other significant projects in 
San Juan Capistrano since the mid-1980s, including the planning and designing 
of a members-only development that was approved by the council in 1987 and 1988 
-- the Marbelle Golf and Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Hausdorfer said his wife went to work for Keith in late 1988 after being 
introduced to the firm's owner by her former employer. 
</P>
<P>
"I stay out of my wife's business career," Hausdorfer said. "She stays out of 
mine."
