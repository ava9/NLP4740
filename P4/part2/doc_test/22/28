The Camarillo City Council on Wednesday approved the creation of a tax district 
and the sale of up to $31 million in bonds to pay for road and sewer 
improvements, taking a step toward major development on vacant land in the 
western part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 0, with one member absent, to form the district near 
Camarillo Airport, clearing the way for developments that city officials have 
already approved on about 600 acres nearby. 
</P>
<P>
It was Camarillo's largest planned borrowing for improvements since 1987, when 
the entire city treasury of $25 million was lost in high-risk trading ventures. 
</P>
<P>
There are only three major property owners in the new district, said City 
Manager William Little. 
</P>
<P>
A separate vote of the three property owners is required before the agency can 
be created, and all are expected to approve the move in a mail ballot in the 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Greeley, the city's director of engineering services, said the three 
properties that will make up the new district, called the West Camarillo 
Community Services District No. 1, are: 
</P>
<P>
* A tract north of the Central Avenue-Ventura Freeway interchange owned by 
Pacific Land &amp; Golf, an Orange County-based company that is planning 
Spanish Hills, a private country club, golf course and residential project. 
</P>
<P>
* The Kohl-Leonard Camarillo Center, a proposed business and commercial complex 
south of the freeway between Las Posas Road and Carmen Drive. 
</P>
<P>
* A 41-acre tract just east of the airport owned by Harry Gelles of Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
The $100-million Spanish Hills project will take up 431 acres of the 600 acres 
involved. The development will be patterned after a recently completed country 
club in San Juan Capistrano called Marbella, said J. Porter Barton, a vice 
president for Pacific Land &amp; Golf. 
</P>
<P>
The city plans to sell the bonds in increments, Little said. In the first 
phase, the city will sell $14.5 million in bonds to be used to expand and 
rebuild deteriorating sewer mains. In later phases, the city expects to sell 
more bonds to widen Central Avenue at the Ventura Freeway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
"As further development occurs, there will be a need to issue more bonds for 
storm drainage improvements and bridges," Little said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has only recently reached a point where it can consider such capital 
projects. In 1987, Camarillo put improvements such as road widening on hold 
after the former treasurer and investments officer lost the city's entire $25 
million treasury through high-risk trading in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the city announced that it was back in the black, with $384,067 in 
the treasury, up from a deficit of more than $3 million in early 1989. The 
turnaround followed two years of no-frills budgets that omitted capital 
improvements, cut back on maintenance and did not allow for replacement of city 
staff members as they quit. 
</P>
<P>
Greeley said the city is ready to begin working on design of the sewers, sewer 
pump stations and force mains on the improvements approved Wednesday, pending 
approval by the three property owners. City officials hope to have the sewer 
improvements completed in 18 to 24 months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials expect construction of the projects to begin in 1991.
