FT  21 MAY 94 / Sport: Ryder Cup brings pain in Spain - Golf

The Spanish venue for the 1997 Ryder Cup will be announced at the Volvo PGA
Championship at Wentworth on Wednesday. This was to have been the greatest
day in Spanish golf history, the culmination of a heavily romantic story
that began in 1976 when Severiano Ballesteros charmed us all with his
performance in the Open Championship at Royal Birkdale.
But sadly, the great day approaches with Spanish golf in turmoil. Seven
clubs have applied to stage the Ryder Cup but Valderrama, near Gibraltar, is
widely expected to win.
But Ballesteros, Spain's leading golfing ambassador, has fallen out with
Valderrama: last week he accused the club of offering him a bribe to support
their case, a claim he later retracted.
Ballesteros will not speak to the Spanish Golf Federation either - he has
accused it of being a cancer on the game.
Ballesteros is widely expected to be the 1997 Ryder Cup captain, but here
again there are wounds to be healed.
Last month he resigned from the Ryder Cup committee in a fit of pique when
it became obvious that his nomination, Novo Sancti Petri, near Cadiz, had no
chance. And last week, he raised the question of whether the committee,
which decides on who is to be captain, had been offered inducements by
Valderrama or any of the other venues.
'If he said that to my face I'd punch him on the nose,' said committee
member David Huish. Ballesteros said this week he did not mean to imply the
committee had acted dishonourably.
Adding to the elements of farce is the fact that the Ryder Cup will do
little for golf in Spain.
Parallels with taking football's World Cup to America are striking. The
Spanish do not care for golf. Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has done
nothing to help Ballesteros in his long-standing desire to bring the game to
the masses.
Notoriously, Gonzalez declared 10 years ago that golf was a 'rich man's
game' and, of course, by providing no money to help build municipal courses
he has perpetuated his own theory.
It is an especially sorry situation given that for almost 20 years the
game's best loved and most charismatic figure has been a Spaniard.
More than any other golfer, Ballesteros has been responsible for the recent
explosion of interest in the sport, but in his own backyard there has been
no reaction. Even now, when golf courses have appeared all over Europe,
Spain has just one 18-hole public course, and to get on that you have to be
in the know.
To be fair, the Spanish Golf Federation does have a number of schemes,
including the Escorial School in Madrid, to help those who are not from
wealthy backgrounds to play the game. However, little help is forthcoming
from the sports ministry and with no available courses, it faces an almost
impossible task.
Here is an example of the impact golf currently has on Spanish sporting
life: in Jerez in February, when Ballesteros made his comeback to the game
after a four-month break, the news promoted a small army of golf
correspondents and sports feature writers to travel from Britain. The story
took up half of page 40 in each of the two 48-page tabloid Spanish sports
dailies.
On that comeback day, Ballesteros played with Jack Nicklaus, the game's
greatest name, and Miguel Jiminez, who comes from Jerez.
The number of spectators following the trio reached a grand total of 42.
'Passion for Golf', said a sign by the 18th, belonging to the Spanish
tourist board . . .but little was in evidence.
So why is the Ryder Cup going to Spain?
Ireland, as golf-obsessed a country as it is possible to find, has never
hosted the contest. Spain was chosen because of the support the country has
given to the European Tour since 1971. But the golf there is played by
ex-patriots, tourists and the Spanish elite. As for sponsorship, the Spanish
tourist board almost single-handedly sponsored the early part of this year's
tour. Acutely aware of the importance of golf to tourism in many Spanish
regions, the board sponsored events in all the holiday areas, such as
Andalucia, the Costa del Sol and the islands, Majorca and Tenerife.
This has brought accusations that the Ryder Cup has become a crutch to prop
up the European Tour's schedule.
Regardless of who gets the nomination, what is to be fervently hoped is that
in the 40 or so months that remain before the contest, some dramatic strides
forward are made in the infrastructure of the game in Spain.
The glory of the matches is the impact they have in getting people
interested in the sport. But that will be lost if average sports-minded
Spaniards, intrigued as they undoubtedly will be by the Ryder Cup, seek out
a place to play the game themselves only to find none available.
