WITH A near 2,000 mile stretch of coastline, France offers the homebuyer who
has designs on living by the water three choices: the Channel, the Atlantic
or the Mediterranean. A variety of property styles and climate to go with
the three expanses of water are also on offer.
For those living in south-east England the spring opening of the Channel
tunnel will make a weekend home on the northern French coast a more inviting
and easily-obtainable prospect.
The French tourist board stresses the virtues of the Opal coast - 55 miles
of beaches, dunes and cliffs between Calais and Berck.
It will be possible to reach the resort of Le Touquet and lesser-known
Hardelot (founded by Englishman John Whitley at the beginning of the
century) in three hours from London.
Hardelot is a resort with many activities to amuse all the family. It has
two of the Opal coast's eight golf courses, a sizeable equestrian centre, a
tennis club and 10 miles of broad beach (much used for horse-riding and
sand-yachting) stretched before a pine forest. Then there is a compact town,
with boutiques and restaurants, to interest all shoppers.
Lesur Promotion has a choice of property in the resort to suit most buyers -
apartments, seafront or in more secluded areas, from Pounds 48,000.
A family looking for a weekend home may prefer to have a house built.
Different sized plots can be bought from Pounds 60,000 either on a golf
course or tucked away in pine woods. A three- to five-bedroom villa is
standard, as is the steep roof. This would cost Pounds 80,000 upwards on top
of the plot price. Other prospective buyers might prefer an
individually-designed property. (Information from Lesur Promotion Hardelot
21 91 91 00).
Earlier this year a group of established British-based estate agents
offering property in France combined to form Groupe France, which
collectively almost covers the country. Each company continues to specialise
in a defined area, but when one does not have a particular type of property
sought after, the applicant's name is passed on to a fellow agent.
One member of the group, Rutherfords (071-386-7240), extolls the virtues of
west coast France - bracing air, beaches cleaned by the Atlantic ocean. It
suggests resales at Port Bourgemay, near Les Sables d'Olonne, could be
useful buys. A typical studio starts from Pounds 24,500, a furnished
two-bedroom apartment from Pounds 43,000. Port Bourgemay has a sandy beach,
golf course, tennis and other resort facilities.
Up to 100,000 Britons are selling their property in France, says Frank
Rutherford. Indeed Britons buying resales at Port Bourgemay will likely be
buying from fellow countrymen, saving time and trouble.
On the south coast of France the choice of property is immense, with a price
tag to match.
Residence Atoll Beach, at Port Saint-Laurent is a new eye-catching block of
apartments, built in a series of horizontal lines. It took the development
company, Atoll Beach, seven years to obtain permission for the project,
which involved relocating the nearby road to enable the apartments a
situation next to the sea.
The completed, crescent-shaped building, on six floors, comprises 109 one to
four-bedroom apartments, with shops at ground level and a hotel with
swimming pool. Prices range from Pounds 150,000 for a large studio with
terrace and sea view, to Pounds 1.24m for a four-bedroom, four-bathroom
apartment, with basement garaging. (London agent is David de Lara &amp;
Partners, 081-742-0708).
For those who prefer something with more privacy, a recently-restored 1920s
house on the water, with private mooring, beach and cove, is available on
the Cote de l'Esterel, west of Cannes.
Each of the villa's three bedrooms has a balcony overlooking the sea. The
owner, a member of a rock group, is seeking Pounds 1.6m, through London
agent Barbers (071-381-0112).
Canalside houses at Port Grimaud, the 'lagoon city' in the Gulf of St Tropez
are as near the water as is possible.
The resort has grown to 2,500 homes. On a summer evening a procession of
boats can be seen - their owners returning them to the end-of-the-garden
moorings.
Building began at the resort in 1966 and was due to be completed by now, but
the final section has not yet been built. This will comprise 40 apartments
and 55 houses - reservations are awaited. Meantime there are a few other new
properties available and some resales. (Sales office Port Grimaud 94 36 21
82 or UK contact 0243-572001).
The architect, Francois Spoerry, now aged over 80, has a home there, which
he designed he says, with a smuggled pencil while a prisoner of war.
His commissions have been worldwide but he now concentrates mostly on
France. One current project involves a hotel at Beauvallon, St Maxime, with
additional development, for the American Disney group - its first hotel in
France.
Interesting to watch develop will be a project further east along the coast
at the old port at Frejus.
Spoerry's practice has been brought in to oversee the second phase, which
will mirror Port Grimaud, with its canal side pastel-shaded houses and
slightly taller apartments. But here the development is cut inland, rather
than being built outwards like Grimaud, and the canal will meander beneath
bridges leading to a lake. Several builders will be working on different
sections that will be carefully co-ordinated.
A few properties from the first phase are still available and those in the
next phase will start coming on the market next year. Prices are expected to
be lower than at Port Grimaud. (Information from the developer, La Semaf, at
Frejus 94 82 63 00. Or those whose French is rusty might prefer to contact
Caroline Jenkins at the Frejus Notaries' Office, 94 51 00 05).
Waterside France is not limited to the coast. David Kay, of Waterside
Properties International (0892-750011) points out: 'There are over 33,000
communes in France and 25,000 of them have water features - lakes, tarns,
rivers, canals.' His agency has dozens of inland properties with what he
calls 'water-related opportunities', on its books. There are lock-keepers'
cottages, canalside houses, watermills, restored and unrestored. Prices
range from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 1.5m.
A former windmill, now a two-bedroom house, has views over the bay of Mont
St Michel. A small hotel in a tourist village is 'just a few yards from a
large lake'. A terrace of four cottages is 'ideally situated for gites' and
a five-bedroom watermill close to a lake is just an hour of Paris.
Different again is the 'waterside France' bordering the Alpine lakes.
Whatever the market, someone has it - Alpine Apartments Agency (0544-388234)
specialises in this sort of property.
Seekers of a waterside holiday home are reminded that while a town like
Annecy has popular appeal with its cobbled streets and arcades, prices are
high, even for a one-bedroom apartment. 'Lakeside houses with a mooring at
the bottom of the garden are rare and can command Pounds 950,000.' A
somewhat old-fashioned three-bedroom house looking over the lake at Menthon
is Pounds 255,000.
Close to the Swiss border on Lake Geneva and on the water's edge, is The
Sanctuary, at Meillerie, a phased development of apartments. Prices for
two-bedroom designs are from Pounds 105,000. A rental-income and letting
service, is available. Building starts on the second phase this month.
