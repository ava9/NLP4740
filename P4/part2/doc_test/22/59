Keen golfers moving house always want to know about the nearest course and
how good it is. It follows that the best way to find out is for them to take
their clubs and play 18 holes - as an essential part of househunting.
As they watch the 123rd Open championship at Turnberry in south-west
Scotland this weekend, they can dream of owning a house within a chipping
wedge of any of the venues where the Open is played. Or any course, for that
matter.
A more costly option is actually to buy a working course, or acquire a
greenfield site with planning permission for a course and develop it. Those
with real money might even like to buy a house with its own private course.
Agent Roger Pryor, of Strutt &amp; Parker, says the market for working courses
has stabilised following the property boom of 1988-89 and the subsequent
fall.
As for new courses, planning applications in the south-east were, by 1993,
more than 60 per cent down from their peak in 1990-91 - but 46 per cent of
these were granted, compared with 25 per cent in 1991.
The change has come about because land-owners, developers and local planners
have become stricter in assessing the earnings potential of a course and its
impact on the community and environment. The banks, which lost large amounts
in funding grandiose schemes, are more circumspect too.
Today, planning permission for a golf course does not provide an automatic
premium over agricultural value, says Jim Bryant, of Bidwells' leisure team.
Gone are the 1988-89 days of Pounds 15,000 an acre. Pryor agrees. Only prime
sites are likely to achieve a top premium of Pounds 1,000 an acre - which
equates to a total price per acre of about Pounds 3,000.
That sort of figure is reflected in the Pounds 350,000 being asked by
Savills of Banbury for a 121-acre site with permission for an 18-hole
pay-and-play course at Cadmore End, near High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire. It
is close to the M40, and 630,000 people live within 30 minutes' drive. A
pay-and-play alternative nearby has a long waiting list, and Wycombe
district council accepts there is continuing demand.
Strutt &amp; Parker estimates that, at the end of 1993, there was an 18-hole
course for every 15,332 people in south-east England (if those with planning
consent are included). This is half the pre-1989 ratio of one existing
course for every 31,555 people but, says the agent, not all the consents
will be taken up.
County ratios vary widely. Oxfordshire offers one course for every 21,267
people, Buckinghamshire 1:10,230 and Surrey 1:9,550 (using the total of
existing and agreed courses).
Developing a greenfield site can cost up to Pounds 1m, depending on the
design and terrain. But it could be two years before members join and the
cash starts to come in.
At Cadmore End, the estimate for development costs is between Pounds 600,000
and Pounds 750,000 (to include a 4,000 sq ft clubhouse). In the first full
year, the agent expects 35,000 rounds at, say, Pounds 10 apiece on weekdays
and Pounds 15 at the weekend, plus club fees for 850 members. (At many
courses, non-members can pay well over Pounds 20 a round.)
For two similar sites - beside the A27 at Lancing in West Sussex, and at
Welton near Lincoln - Clegg Kennedy Drew is waiting for buyers to suggest a
price. In Devon, though, a site on the Kingsbridge estuary - now a farm with
a five-bedroom house - is on offer through Stags at Pounds 395,000.
According to Tom Marriott, of Humberts Leisure, pay-and-play courses and
commercial clubs are taking over from the traditional private member clubs.
Ten years ago, they made up only 10-20 per cent of all courses; now,
Marriott estimates, they total 30-40 per cent. He says most courses appear
to be trading reasonably; only a few are put on the market by receivers.
If the course operates on a leasehold - as many do - the ground rent and its
review date are important factors for potential buyers (Pounds 300-Pounds
400 an acre is the figure now, says Bryant). One working leasehold course,
on offer from Humberts or the Glasgow agent Ryden, is Brunston Castle near
Turnberry. It was designed by Donald Steel around the Water of Girvan that
flows through the middle, with space for houses, chalets and a hotel. Offers
of more than Pounds 1m are invited.
For Pounds 900,000, Humberts is also selling the Mid-Dorset club in lovely
downlands at Blandford Forum (its thatched farmhouse is extra) and (with
Strutt &amp; Parker) is asking Pounds 1.75m for Woodbury Park near Exeter, with
27 holes. Designed by Hamilton Stutt, of Turnberry fame, it has been working
on a pay-and-play basis and still awaits a proper clubhouse - perhaps even a
hotel.
So you would like a house adjoining a fairway? One such is Little Mingary,
by the 15th at Worplesdon in Surrey (Browns, Pounds 400,000). Then there is
Gullane (from Rettie, offers over Pounds 265,000) by the 1st at the famous
Muirfield course outside Edinburgh which celebrated its 250th anniversary
last weekend.
A little further north are an apartment at Gleneagles, site of the recent
Scottish Open (Bidwells, Pounds 180,000), and Broomfield, a substantial
Edwardian house on Golf Course Road leading to the Rosemount course in
Perthshire (Savills in Brechin, offers over Pounds 390,000).
Cluttons in Ayr has a few houses well placed for the Turnberry, West
Kilbride and Royal Troon courses at prices from Pounds 85,000 to Pounds
250,000 - quite cheap by southern standards.
In Surrey, apartments for sale between Pounds 190,000 and Pounds 250,000 on
the Pyrford course include lifetime membership of the club; Curchods is the
agent. John D. Wood offers two houses in Coombe Park, Kingston upon Thames,
beside the Coombe Hill course, for Pounds 535,000 or Pounds 850,000.
The ultimate must be a course of your own, as at Sundial House near Farnham,
Surrey. Apart from its nine holes, the owners have built a go-kart track in
13.5 acres. Offers over Pounds 800,000 are sought (down from over Pounds
900,000) through Hamptons or Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. Another with its own
course is Great Swifts at Cranbrook, Kent, a 1930s' Georgian-style mansion
for which Lane Fox set a guide price of Pounds 950,000. Offers came in at
more than Pounds 1m.
Finally, an agent near Turnberry said this week: 'The whole of south
Ayrshire is off on holiday.' That is because householders who are prepared
to surrender their four-bedroom homes to Open competitors or fans can demand
Pounds 2,000-Pounds 3,000 for a nine-day let. And if the house is really
big, they can charge well over Pounds 1,000 a day.
