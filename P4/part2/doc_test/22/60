FOR THOSE whose passion is messing about in boats, and have the money,
buying a house or flat close to their vessel can make good sense. But avoid
marinas if you are a sailor who prefers to be alone.
For the clubby, however, Moriconium Quay, a new development around a yacht
basin at Poole, Dorset - which Savills is marketing - could be ideal. The
first stage sold quickly and the second-stage apartments come to market in
September (although some have gone already).
Prices are Pounds 129,000 or Pounds 135,000 for 125-year leaseholds but,
unlike the houses in the first stage, do not include berths. These (also
leasehold) cost Pounds 35,000 for a boat of 11 metres (36ft) or Pounds
40,000 for 13 metres (42.5ft), which is good value when spread over several
years.
A similar project in Dorset is Priory Quay at Christchurch, near
Bournemouth; there are two units left at Pounds 235,000 - but these do
include a berth (with an annual service charge of around Pounds 800). Black
Horse is selling them on behalf of the developer, Portman Homes.
At Sandbanks, overlooking Poole harbour, the two-year-old Beach House has an
unusual design and a private beach. Three agents (Fox, Norris &amp; Owen, and
Black Horse - Canford Cliffs office) offer it at Pounds 495,000.
In Sussex, Jackson-Stops at Chichester is asking Pounds 385,000 for
Moonrakers, a 1934 house at Bosham, on Chichester harbour, with slipway and
jetty. At Brighton Marina, Fox, in Haywards Heath, is selling units at
Roedean House for Pounds 375,000. This is new on the market and all buyers
get a 40ft mooring for Pounds 1,224 a year - which they must pay even if
they do not keep a boat.
If a marina is too communal, Bar House on the Helford river in Cornwall is
the antithesis. The seven-bedroomed property, which includes a small beach
and boathouse with slipway, once belonged to Claude Worth, a pioneer of
modern small-boat cruising who wrote Yacht Cruising (1910) and Yacht
Navigation and Voyaging (1927). Jackson-Stops in Exeter is seeking Pounds
600,000-plus.
Another Cornish property with boathouse and slipway is at Restronguet Point
on the Fal estuary. Called The Boathouse, it is priced at Pounds 420,000
from Miller. Five houses along, Carrick Cottage is Pounds 20,000 cheaper; it
has a slipway but no boathouse.
A further Boat House (with slipway) is available in the village of Portloe
for around Pounds 270,000, while 3 Mulberry Quay, on the inner harbour of
Falmouth, offers use of the private quay and dinghy davit; price: Pounds
165,000. Both are from Miller.
In south Devon, Stratton Creber is selling the white-painted Rock Cottage in
Newton Ferrers; it has a garden with 120ft frontage to the Yealm estuary and
steps down to the foreshore, where the dinghy can be beached. Price: Pounds
175,000.
Gales can be a problem around the south coast, of course, but they are not
usually a worry on canals. At Bradford on Avon, eight miles from Bath, Logis
Homes has developed St Katherine's Quay to offer a base on the Kennet and
Avon canal for Pounds 49,950 to Pounds 129,950 (through Gratton Palmer
Snell).
At Braunston, near Daventry in Northamptonshire, Stepnells is developing
Brindley Quays. The basin has plenty of space for berthing narrow boats
(around Pounds 1,200 a year for a typical 50-footer) while a 1792 dry dock
remains in use. Houses will be ready later in the year for Pounds 129,750
(through Knight Frank &amp; Rutley).
Somewhere between canalside and seaside is the Georgian Red House on a
tributary of the river Great Ouse at Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire. This
red-brick property has many bedrooms, a boathouse and a riverside studio.
Price: Pounds 245,000 (from Carter Jonas).
The Landmark Trust, meanwhile, is asking Pounds 1.25m for The Limes, an
imposing house built in 1720 and overlooking the Thames from Mortlake High
Street, west London. Turner painted the house twice in 1827; both pictures
are in the US.
The trust bought the property as an investment and has refurbished it. It
now wants to find a sympathetic buyer in order to raise money for saving
other buildings. Three agents are handling the sale: DTZ Debenham Thorpe,
Hamptons and Martin Campbell.
