TRAVELLING around the coasts and ski resorts of France, you might have
noticed the name Pierre &amp; Vacances. You might even have thought it rather
odd in translation: Peter and Holidays.
In fact, it is not really translatable. 'Investment in leisure' is probably
the closest you get, for the group is a leading French leisure/property
developer and tour operator. On the one hand, it builds and sells holiday
properties; on the other, it rents them out. It is expanding into Spain and
Portugal and has just opened an office in London (071-495-2414).
The group's interest in leisure began in the 1960s when, during a period of
tremendous expansion in the industry, it created the traffic-free resort of
Avoriaz in the French alps, offering apartments and facilities for
holidaymakers.
It then undertook their management for private owners and institutional
investors. As it increased the number of its developments, it provided a
growing range of services for owners and now has 100 complexes in 50
locations in France, representing 20,000/25,000 apartments and 72,000 beds
available for letting. Overall, the average price of its apartments is
Pounds 60,000, although it has villas on the Cote d'Azur at up to Pounds 1m.
Surveys by the group showed that people who bought holiday apartments used
them for only four to eight weeks a year. So, leaseback was born. If a buyer
wishes, he can pay 30 per cent less for an apartment, furnish it, and lease
it to the group for 11 years. During that time, he can use it himself for
six weeks annually. He has no maintenance or management charges to pay and
P&amp;V guarantees to hand the property back at French government 'three-star'
standard.
The group has sold 15,000 of its apartments under leaseback (of which there
are variations), although many buyers still prefer outright ownership and
the freedom to use their property when they choose.
P&amp;V has a range of resorts and complexes in the mountains and along the
Mediterranean coast, while others are appearing on France's Atlantic coast
and in the Channel area. It plans its apartments carefully. There is a
warehouse near Paris where mock-ups of new designs are built and tried out
and where there are experiments with finishes and furnishing.
The group's integrated resorts may have restaurants, hotels, swimming pools,
tennis, riding, perhaps a lake for water sports. A number have golf courses,
including Port Bourgenay on the Atlantic coast. Built as a seaside village
in 290 acres, it also has a small marina and a sandy beach. Three-bedroom
terrace properties with views over the fairways cost Pounds 89,000 for
outright ownership and are available now. Apartments start at Pounds 33,000
for studios (outright ownership) or Pounds 22,900 (leaseback). Available in
June.
Aiguemer takes in 225 acres on the shores of the St Tropez peninsular. Its
18-hole course will run alongside the beach and a selection of properties is
being built there. One-bedroom apartments are from Pounds 77,000 (outright
ownership) and Pounds 45,000 (leaseback) while two-bedroom golf houses are
Pounds 132,000 (outright ownership). The completion date is 1997.
There are various similar projects in hand by P&amp;V, a private group of
companies in which the Bremond family still holds nearly 80 per cent.
Partners include Credit Agricole, Credit Foncier and the insurance group
Axa, Net profit last year was something over Pounds 7m.
So is it all plain sailing for P&amp;V? Not quite. Some people say leaseback is
not a good system in times of recession and that units could be difficult to
re-sell part-way through a contract. The group disagrees and says: 'Of
course people can re-sell' - but they have to do so subject to the rental
contract, or negotiate another. It adds that, normally, there is somebody
quite happy to buy within the contract.
P&amp;V has another problem: the 'green people,' as staff call environmentalists
who claim it is spoiling the landscape. For obvious reasons, the group's
leisure developments are in attractive areas and some of the sites are
large.
Permission for a golf course can lead to a lot of housing around it and the
environmentalists have been objecting. A new resort, Cap Esterel, a short
drive from Cannes, spreads over 500 acres. It has a golf course, swimming
pool complex and Provencal-style village, with shops. But the greens
protested to the authorities and the planned 18-hole course was cut to nine.
The number of residential units has been reduced and an area of the
development 'frozen' for building.
Another project, at Gassin near St Tropez, was to have had a 27-hole course,
town houses, villas, apartments, a 40-bedroom hotel and swimming pool.
Development had been under way for a year when green protests resulted in
planning permission being revoked. P&amp;V has appealed.
There were objections, too, about Aiguemer, and the group appears to have
taken these to heart. Advance drawings of the project show the properties
wreathed in flowers and creepers and a landscaping company has been brought
in to find a succession of plants that will provide flowers and greenery
thoroughout the year.
Now, P&amp;V appears to be changing tack. It has taken a 5.6 per cent (likely to
be increased) stake in the 4,000-acre Sotogrande estate in southern Spain
and says it will be responsible for running the estate and future
development.
The opportunity came with a change of ownership of Sotogrande, which has
been taken over by the Spanish company Cofir. There are ambitious plans to
bring the estate 'alive' by building an inner lagoon and marina and a large
number of town houses and apartments. There will be two new golf courses and
more villas inland.
P&amp;V's joint managing director, Michel Gasteau, says the group will be
starting leaseback at Sotogrande next year. It also has other plans in Spain
and has been discussing a joint venture involving apartments with a bank.
Meanwhile, Cofir is involved in Vilamoura, on Portugal's Algarve coast, and
P&amp;V also plans to move into Portugal as well as increasing its sales network
in Italy.
So, is P&amp;V being driven out of France by envirnomentalists? Sales manager
Francois Mautaint denies this although he admits it is becoming more
difficult to get permission for beachside locations there. But the group was
becoming international and in no way retreating from France, he said.
