A San Juan Capistrano developer and a Japanese construction company said 
Thursday that they have bought 430 acres in Camarillo, where they will sell 
land for houses around a lavish 18-hole golf course and country club. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Land &amp; Golf Inc. and Sato Kogyo America Corp. said the land 
purchase -- estimated to have cost about $45 million -- is thought to be one of 
the largest ever in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The partners will sell 186 sites of one to three acres for custom-built houses 
around the country club, called Spanish Hills Golf &amp; Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
The partners say their market research shows strong demand for the golf course 
in Camarillo, which is midway between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The ocean-view golf course will be designed by Robert Cupp, who was a course 
designer for 10 years with pro golfer Jack Nicklaus' company. This is 
Atlanta-based Cupp Design Inc.'s first golf course in California. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of Pacific Land &amp; Golf developed the Marbella Golf and Country 
Club in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Sato Kogyo American is a U.S. subsidiary of Sato Kogyo Co., a large Tokyo 
engineering and construction company founded in 1862. It has been involved in 
the U.S. real estate market since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Cushman Realty Corp. of Los Angeles was financial adviser to the partnership 
and arranged financing for the $150-million project. Cushman elected to stay on 
as a limited partner, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-style country club will be designed by Robert Altevers Associates 
of Costa Mesa. The firm has designed many clubhouses, including the La Quinta 
Country Club near Palm Springs.
