</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chula Vista came within seconds of doing what no other team in California had 
done this year -- defeat the Sweetwater High boys' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista held an eight-point lead with two minutes 47 seconds remaining, but 
then it was tied with seven seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Sweetwater's Joe McDowell sank two free throws to sink Chula 
Vista's hope of an upset at home against the county's top-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater's 73-71 victory in front of a standing-room-only Monday night crowd 
gave Sweetwater the Metro Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Devils, whose only loss was to a Seattle team in a tournament in 
Burnaby, Canada, are 24-1, 11-0. Sweetwater has just one game remaining against 
Bonita Vista before the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista, previously ranked 10th, fell to 19-7, 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
After McDowell (21 points) made his free throws, Chula Vista zipped the ball 
upcourt where Shane Howell attempted a 19-foot shot from the right baseline. 
The ball carommed off the front of the rim and over with one second left. A 
Chula Vista player grabbed the rebound and was fouled, but time had expired. 
</P>
<P>
Sent to the line with seven seconds left, McDowell, a senior guard, said he was 
thinking about all the free throws he had missed (four) earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"My friend Carlos (Campbell) told me its just like in practice, McDowell said. 
"(He told me) take my time and take my mind off the crowd. Once I made the 
first one, I knew the second was going down." 
</P>
<P>
The trend of the game was such: Sweetwater would build a lead -- normally four 
to seven points -- and Chula Vista would scramble back close. 
</P>
<P>
But that changed late in the third quarter when Chula Vista turned a six-point 
deficit into a 62-53 lead by scoring 15 unanswered points. 
</P>
<P>
Carnell Penn, who led all scorers with 29 points, scored 10 in the run, 
including the first six. "All I was thinking about was bringing the team back," 
Penn said. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Green then gave Chula Vista its first lead since the first quarter, 
55-53, with an 18-footer and added a free throw eight seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
The only other Spartan to score in the run was Derek Chapman, who tipped in his 
own missed shot with one second left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
At 2:47 in the fourth, Chula Vista held a 68-60 lead, but Sweetwater scored 
nine of the next 10 tying it, 69-69, with 1:21 left on Campbell's tip of a 
McDowell missed free throw. Campbell finished with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
After Penn made a layup, Sweetwater reserve Isaac Bruce made a layup with 18 
seconds left to tie it, 71-71, and set up McDowell's heroics. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater took the opening tip and assumed an 8-0 lead after nearly three 
minutes. McDowell scored the first six points and Mendel Nafarrete added a 
17-foot jumper. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista could do little right early on, but soon found its groove.
