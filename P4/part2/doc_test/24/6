Not selected as one of the 48 teams in the NCAA tournament, the San Diego State

annual eight-team women's National Invitational Tournament in Amarillo, Tex., 
March 23-25.

"We thought perhaps that we should have been one of the teams in the NCAA, but 
the committee didn't feel that way," SDSU Coach Earnest Riggins said. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that we're a better team than we showed in the last six or seven 
ballgames. Certainly, our overall record (23-8) was good enough but losing five 
of our last seven hurt us."

The Aztecs will take on eighth-seeded Radford (23-6) at 1 p.m. March 21 in the 
first round of the single-elimination tournament. The top-seeded team has been

young UC San Diego team confidence going into the San Diego Crew Classic April
