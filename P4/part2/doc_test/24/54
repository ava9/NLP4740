Under the playoff system used two years ago in San Diego Section high school 
boys' basketball, El Capitan and Mission Bay would not have met in the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
Going into Monday's Division II first round, Mission Bay (16-7, 7-3 in the City 
Western League) would have competed in the Class 2-A playoffs. El Capitan 
(9-17, 2-6 in the Grossmont 3-A League) would have had its season over by now. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, like last season, every team is eligible for the playoffs, where 
60 games over a two-week period will determine five champions. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay's winning percentage was 32% higher than El Capitan's. And, for 
three quarters Monday, it looked as if the Buccaneers would win handily. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay led by 25 points early in the fourth quarter, but held on for a 
67-59 victory at home to advance to the second round Thursday against 
eighth-seeded Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a little late and a little short with the comeback," said Jim Gleboff, 
El Capitan's coach. 
</P>
<P>
But the effort was valiant. Jeremy McGarity scored 12 of his game-high 25 
points and Eagle LaChappa (nine points) made three three-pointers in the fourth 
quarter as El Capitan outscored Mission Bay, 23-6, over the final 7 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
With runs of five and 11 points, El Capitan pulled to within, 63-52, with 3 
minutes left. After Peter Wilson made two free throws and Brett Grebing one, El 
Capitan scored seven in a row to pull within, 66-59. But only 14 seconds 
remained. A Ken North free throw ended the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
For three quarters, Mission Bay dominated behind the shooting and passing of 
Wilson. The 5-foot-8 point guard had 19 points (only two in the fourth quarter) 
and 11 assists. Six-foot-six center Brett Grebing added 14 points and 11 
rebounds. Keith Berkley and Jim Thomas had 10 each. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, known more for his passing and ballhandling skills than his scoring 
ability, has a season-high of 20 points against Kearny. But come playoff time, 
Wilson, a senior, seems to shine. Last season, in a 61-51 first-round playoff 
victory over San Pasqual, Wilson had 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's crunch time. That's where I get my motivation," said Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mission Bay Coach Mike Seaman, "He goes unnoticed for the contributions 
that he makes. But tonight, he had a great game." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay won seven of its last eight league games to finish in a first-place 
tie with La Jolla.
