  [Text] The former president of Afghanistan, Professor 
Sebghatollah Mojaddedi, called on the president, Mr. Farooq 
Ahmad Khan Leghari, in Islamabad today. During the meeting, he 
held wide-ranging discussions with the president. Speaking of 
prospects of peace in Afghanistan, President Leghari emphasized 
that this will have to be an indigenous process, as anything 
imposed from outside would never last. The president also 
expressed the hope that developed countries would not wait for 
complete peace to begin reconstruction work in Afghanistan. 
Prof. Mojaddedi thanked the president for his noble sentiments 
and affirmed that he would make every effort to bring to an end 
the fratricidal struggle in his country.
