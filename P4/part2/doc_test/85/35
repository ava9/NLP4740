  [Text] Islamabad -- Pakistan said Saturday [4 June] that 
by test-firing its short-range ballistic missile India has 
unleashed a race of sophisticated weapons in South Asia. 
  The Pakistani reaction came hours after India test-fired 
Prithvi, which can carry a payload of one ton up to 190 km (150 
miles), in the bay of Bengal. 
  "By test-firing the missile India has brought all major 
Pakistani cities, except the southern most city of Quetta, under 
its range," said Munir Akram, a spokesman for the Pakistan 
Foreign Office. 
  He said India was also looking for locations to test-fire 
the 
medium range Agni missile which can carry a payload of one ton 
up to 2,400 km. 
  On his return from a visit to the United States on Friday 
president Farooq Leghari told reporters that he has conveyed 
Pakistan's concerns to the US administration over India's 
efforts to deploy medium-and short-range missiles in the region. 
  "It is a new phase in the arms race in South Asia. It will 
now unleash a missile race in the region," said Akram. 
  The deployment of these missiles, according to him, will 
shorten the warning time of any surprise attack against Pakistan 
down to a few minutes "and, therefore, increase the hair-trigger 
environment in South Asia". 
  He said Pakistan has advised all countries concerned, 
especially the members of the Missile Technology control Regime, 
to urge India not to go ahead with the development and 
deployment of these missiles. 
  He said Pakistan had so far been talking to the United 
States 
and had established no direct contact with India over the matter 
"but we will consider other diplomatic options as well".
