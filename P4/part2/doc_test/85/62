  [Text] The secretary-level talks between Pakistan and India 
began in Islamabad today. Foreign Secretary Mr. Shaharyar Khan 
is leading the Pakistani side, while the Indian delegation is 
headed by the external affairs secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit. 
Quoting Foreign Office sources, Pakistan Television diplomatic 
correspondent says during the four rounds of talks, the 
Pakistani side would endeavor to focus attention on all aspects 
of the Kashmir dispute as already agreed to by New Delhi in 
order to find out a negotiated and peaceful settlement of the 
problem. Our correspondent says Pakistan has been calling upon 
India to stop repression and atrocities in the occupied 
territory and make visible improvement on the ground in the 
valley in order to ensure continuation of dialogue in a positive 
direction. Other issues relating to bilateral matters may also 
be taken up during the talks. Additional foreign secretary, Mr. 
Munir Akram, who is taking part in the talks, spoke to Pakistan 
Television about the first round of talks. 
  [Begin Akram recording] So far the talks have started on a 
note of seriousness and both the president and the foreign 
secretary have underlined our desire for a peaceful solution of 
the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir on the basis of the 
resolutions of the United Nations. The talks have so far 
focused on Kashmir, and we have had a first round of reiteration 
of the positions of the two sides. We have also underlined the 
need to create propitious conditions for the search for a 
peaceful solution and the necessity for an end to the repression 
in Kashmir for the creation of such conditions. [end recording] 
  The Indian foreign secretary called on President Farooq 
Ahmad 
Leghari at the Aiwan-i-Sadr [President House] today and 
discussed with him matters of bilateral interests. Referring to 
the foreign secretary-level bilateral talks, the president 
wished them all success. The president told Mr. Dixit that 
Pakistan is very keen to see a just and honorable solution of 
the Kashmir problem, but there is a great deal of anguish over 
the suppression of human rights in the occupied valley. The 
Indian foreign secretary said he has come to Pakistan with 
concrete ideas and with a will to move forward. Mr. Dixit also 
conveyed to the president greetings and best wishes from the 
Indian president and the prime minister. 
  Mr. J.N. Dixit also called on Prime Minister Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto in Karachi today. Welcoming the Indian foreign 
secretary, the prime minister said she is glad that the 
secretary-level talks have resumed after a gap of 15 months. 
She reaffirmed Pakistan's position on Kashmir and asked the 
Indian foreign secretary to take visible steps regarding 
improvement of human rights situation in the occupied Kashmir. 
Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that the secretary-level talks are 
being held at an important juncture of India-Pakistan relations 
and needed to demonstrate positive results. The Indian foreign 
secretary conveyed the good wishes of Prime Minister Narasimha 
Rao to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and said that he has come 
to Pakistan to discuss basic issues seriously with a view to 
making progress in the India-Pakistan bilateral relations. He 
expressed the hope that progress would be possible as a result 
of this bilateral contact between the two countries. Present at
