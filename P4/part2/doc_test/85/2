  [Text] President Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari arrived 
in New York from Washington. He is accompanied by Punjab Chief 
Minister Mian Manzur Watoo and Dr. Maliha Lodhi, Pakistan's 
ambassador to the United States. Before his departure, the 
president said that despite being on a private visit, he 
utilized the opportunity and exchanged views with Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher and other U.S. leaders on matters of 
mutual interest. The president said that he told the U.S. 
leaders during his visit that Pakistan wants the United States 
to help resolve the Kashmir issue and end grave violations of 
human rights in occupied Kashmir. The United States was urged to 
cooperate in arms control and nuclear nonproliferation in South 
Asia and to help accelerate economic development to bring about 
prosperity in the region. Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari said 
that we want to enhance cooperation with the United States in 
various sectors on the basis of equality and nondiscrimination.
