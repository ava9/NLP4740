  [Text] Pyongyang, May 3 (KCNA) -- C.R. Aslam, president of 
the Pakistan Socialist Party; Ghulam Nadikalr, chairman of the 
Workers and Peasants Party of Pakistan; Miraj Khalid, chairman 
of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organisation of Pakistan; 
Mazari Ali Khan, chairman of the Pakistan Peace Council; and 7 
other leading officials of political parties and organisations 
of Pakistan made public a joint appeal on April 14 on the 
occasion of the first anniversary of the publication of 
"10-point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for 
the Reunification of the Country" advanced by the great leader 
President Kim Il-song. 
  Noting that the great leader President Kim Il-song is making 
consistent efforts to achieve the independent and peaceful 
reunification of the country, the appeal called upon the 
government, the people and all political party leaders of 
Pakistan to positively support the 10-point programme. 
  The appeal called upon the South Korean people to put 
pressure upon the South Korean authorities to discard the idea 
of submitting to outside forces, get the U.S. troops and nuclear 
weapons withdrawn from South Korea and pull down the concrete 
wall. 
  The appeal called upon the people of the United States to 
urge the U.S. administration to immediately stop the military 
provocations in the Korean peninsula and withdraw the U.S. 
troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea and upon all member 
nations of the United Nations to bar the United States from 
using international organisations in threatening and 
blackmailing the sovereignty of the DPRK.
