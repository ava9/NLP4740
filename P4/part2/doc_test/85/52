  [Text] The president, Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, 
has said that Pakistan will continue to support the cause of the 
people of Bosnia-Herzegovina at all forums in all possible 
manners. He was talking to the Bosnian prime minister, Mr.

the meeting, the president conveyed to the Bosnian prime 
minister deep anguish of the people and government of Pakistan 
over the continuing aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina. Mr. 
Haris Silajdzic thanked the president for Pakistan's support to 
the people of Bosnia for which, he said, his nation will remain 
eternally grateful. He briefed the president about the latest 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly highlighting the 
problems created by the continuing arms embargo against it. 
  Later, the president hosted a luncheon in honor of the 
Bosnian prime minister. It was attended, among others, by the 
chairman of the Senarte, Mr. Wasim Sajjad, Minister for 
Production retired Brigadier Mohammad Asghar and members of the
