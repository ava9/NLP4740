  [Text] The president, Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, 
has reiterated that Pakistan's nuclear program is peaceful, and 
we have taken a conscious decision not to use our nuclear 
capability for weapon production unless our security is 
threatened. Addressing the Pakistani community in New York, he 
categorically rejected any inspection of Pakistan's nuclear 
facilities, saying that the government's policy in this 
connection is very clear. The president said Pakistan's nuclear 
program enjoys national consensus, and it is not possible for 
any government or leader to accept anything imposed from outside 
contrary to the wishes of the people of Pakistan. He said that 
reports accusing the government has agreed to open up its 
facility for any kind of inspections are baseless and frivolous. 
[sentence as heard] 
  The president said Pakistan has told the United States that 
no unilateral solution could be imposed on Pakistan. Any 
solution to the nonproliferation problem in South Asian region 
has to be resolved in the regional context. He said that 
Pakistan has proposed several concrete plans to achieve nuclear 
nonproliferation in the region, but India has rejected all of 
them. Under the circumstances, the United States or the world 
at large could not expect realistically that Pakistan would 
accept any unilateral obligation. 
  Replying to a question, he debunked the reports that 
Pakistan 
has entered into any secret talks with the United States on the 
nonproliferation issue. He said Pakistan is pursuing a quiet 
diplomacy, but not secret diplomacy, as has been done by others. 
Referring to his talks with the U.S. Administration, the 
president expressed the confidence that these talks would yield 
good results.
