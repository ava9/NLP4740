  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 14--The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, today urged friends of Pakistan--an obvious 
reference to the United States, among others--to persuade 
Islamabad to be responsive to India's approach for normalising 
and building up bilateral relations. The Pakistan Prime 
Minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, had heightened the anti-India 
rhetoric to unprecedented levels on Kashmir which, naturally, 
aim in the way of dialogue he said. 
  Mr. Rao underscored the futility of this course, for 
eventually she would have to come to the negotiation table. Her 
own father had signed the Shimla agreement and someone had to 
tell her, according to Mr. Rao, to adhere to it. 
  The Prime Minister made these points in a conversation with 
the visiting U.S. Senator, Mr. Daniel Patrick Moynihan who said 
he would convey these views to his President, Mr. Bill Clinton. 
Mr. Moynihan gave a similar assurance when Mr. Rao stressed the 
urgency of all out efforts to end the Bosnia crisis which was 
fuelling the fires of Muslim fundamentalism all over the world. 
  The current state of Indo-Pakistan--and also 
Indo-U.S.--relations figured at length at the meeting the Prime 
Minister had with Mr. Moynihan who is the chairman of the U.S. 
Senate Panel on South Asia and a former Ambassador to India. 
<H5>  Framework Exists </H5>
  Mr. Moynihan, who sought the Prime Minister's views on 
Indo-Pakistan ties, was told that a framework of dialogue 
between the two countries already existed in the form of the 
Shimla Agreement. India, according to Mr. Rao, had offered to 
continue talks for good-neighbourly relations but Pakistan's 
actions in continuing its support to terrorism in Jammu and 
Kashmir and its world-wide anti-India propaganda were major 
barriers. According to Mr. Moynihan, the United States continued 
to favour the Shimla Agreement framework for Indo-Pakistan talks. 
  The present rhetoric was not going to help Pakistan, said 
Mr. 
Rao. Unless Islamabad jettisoned the Shimla framework there was 
no justification for its leaders to go from place to place. "I 
am a serious-minded person. I do not want to indulge in 
rhetoric. It would be waste of time and energy and would 
encourage tension," Mr. Rao said. 
<H5>  `Strange' </H5>
  It was strange, according to the Prime Minister, that India 
should be blamed for human rights violation when it had an 
independent judiciary, free press, and democratic system--and 
now a human rights commission to probe cases of excesses. Mr. 
Moynihan remarked: "You have my sympathies and respect." 
  Regarding Indo-U.S. relations, they discussed both the 
positive and the negative aspects in the bilateral field. Mr. 
Moynihan was happy at the growth of economic ties, as evidenced 
by the level of U.S. investments in India last year, which was 
higher than that of the previous 40 years. He expressed 
satisfaction at the progress of the economic liberalisation 
programme in India. 
<H5>  `We don't have bomb' </H5>
  As the discussion turned to nuclear non-proliferation, Mr. 
Rao assured Mr. Moynihan that India did not have a bomb and 
therefore there was no question of dismantling it. If they 
(Pakistan) have it they should dismantle it, he said. 
  Mr. Rao's reference to "friends of Pakistan" was obviously 
intended to be a hint to the United States to try to restrain 
Pakistan from pursuing its no-holds-barred anti-India campaign. 
In the immediate context, it could mean persuading Pakistan to 
continue the dialogue begun last month at the level of Foreign 
Secretaries on the basis of the six Indian proposals, regarded 
as positive by Washington, instead of using the international 
for anti-India tirades. 
  As a matter of fact, the Pakistan Foreign Secretary, Mr. 
Shahryar Khan, was now in Washington--obviously to seek U.S. 
support to his Government's move to use the U.N. Human Rights 
Commission for an anti-India campaign. This could be an 
appropriate occasion for the United States, if it so wanted, to 
counsel Pakistan against recklessness. 
  Mr. Moynihan's visit here comes in the wake of the Senate 
panel's hearings where the Clinton Administration's policy on 
South Asia and the style of the Assistant Secretary of State, 
Ms. Robin Raphel--the cause of extreme disquiet here--were 
sharply criticised. Mr. Moynihan strongly defended India on the 
human rights issue, saying that its Constitution provided firm 
guarantees of individual freedom and its record since 1947 was 
impeccable. This was followed by a warning about the futility of 
mechanical application of the standards of civil liberties to 
situations of ethnic conflicts.
