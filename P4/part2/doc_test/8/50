FT  24 JUL 93 / Letter: Priorities for the environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms BARBARA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In your welcome attempt to sort out environmental priorities ('Clarifying
the green agenda', July 21), you identify one of the most pressing political
issues of the decade.
You rightly emphasise the urgent need to assess the threat of climatic
change and to curb emissions. However, in arguing that conserving
biodiversity is the 'most overblown issue of all' you fail to see that the
balanced relationships between the species that make up an ecosystem are as
important as the species themselves. They stem from interactions, many as
yet imperfectly understood, between millions of species. Human life depends
on the stability of these relationships: their preservation is certainly not
'conservation for its own sake'. By suggesting that we simply catalogue and
preserve species in a 'Noah's Ark', you are indulging in a 'Jurassic Park'
fantasy.
Sustainable economic activity depends on the maintenance of biodiversity. It
therefore requires that we manage our resources in ways that do not
irreparably damage ecosystems. Recycling and the use of renewable energy are
therefore important. Narrow attitudes got us into this mess. The sooner we
all recognise that we are part of the planet's ecosystems, not independent
of them, the better.
