FT  18 OCT 93 / Observer: Zola returns
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest barricade behind which French politicians are mustering in the
interminable Gatt negotiations is not wheat but popcorn. They say French
cinema is being engulfed by Hollywood.
But they are drawing strength from Germinal, Claude Berri's newly released
film version of the tough novel by Emile Zola.
In its first week in Paris, Germinal shot straight to number one, attracting
an audience of 170,000. Its nearest rival - the Hollywood film The Fugitive
 -only managed 86,000. Germinal is now hailed as France's bulwark against US
invasion.
But the Parisian intelligentsia - regarded as prehistoric in some quarters -
faces a short-lived victory. Other dinosaurs - featuring in Jurassic Park,
the movie - arrive in Paris on Wednesday.
