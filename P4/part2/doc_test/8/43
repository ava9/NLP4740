The Rank Organisation yesterday reported an interim pre-tax profit down from
Pounds 96.1m to Pounds 16.3m after restructuring charges totalling Pounds
111.6m. But this was well above City expectations and the shares closed 13p
higher at 404 1/2 p yesterday.
Rank, whose interests include Butlin's holidays, casinos and the Hard Rock
Cafes, said that after three difficult years there was an improvement in
underlying trading in the first half.
Before charges, profits were up 41 per cent to Pounds 127.9m. The company
had previously adopted a more cautious view of the recovery.
Pre-tax profit for the 28 weeks to May 14 was after a charge of Pounds
49.6m, relating mostly to the closure of the video distribution business,
and after the group's Pounds 62m share of Rank Xerox's restructuring costs.
Profits from Rank Xerox, before restructuring costs, were up 38 per cent to
Pounds 94.6m.
An improvement in video duplication lifted profits in the film and
television division from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 24.5m. The group said it
expected a strong second half from the video duplication of the film
Jurassic Park.
The Pinewood film studios also enjoyed increased operating profits. Odeon
cinemas saw admissions rise 4 per cent and prices 1 per cent. The group
expects to benefit in the second half from the cinema success of the film
Four Weddings and a Funeral.
The holiday division's profits rose from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 7m. The
number of holidays sold was up 12 per cent in the first half. Bookings for
the summer, however, are only slightly up in volume and 3 per cent by value.
Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive, said the group's older holiday
customers were adversely affected by low interest rates.
The recreation division, which includes bingo clubs and casinos, saw
operating profits increase from Pounds 32.7m to Pounds 34.2m, Bingo profits
were level with last time. Casino admissions were up 3 per cent and spending
per head was 5 per cent higher.
The leisure division, which includes Hard Rock Cafes and holiday resorts,
saw operating profits fall from Pounds 22.3m to Pounds 20.4m.
(Pounds 972.4m), including discontinued operations of Pounds 26.1m (Pounds
75.5m).
The interim dividend is 4.25p. Last year, the group paid a full year's
dividend at the interim stage, with an enhanced share alternative. It said
the equivalent pay-out at the halfway stage last time would have been 4.03p.
Losses per share were 3.4p (earnings 5.4p). After adjustment for Rank Xerox
restructuring costs, earnings were 7.8p (4.9p).
