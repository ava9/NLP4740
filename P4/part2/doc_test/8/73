Hollywood brings its big guns to Britain this week. Forrest Gump and The
Lion King are the box-office phenomena of the year.
They have made Pounds  1/2 bn in America, and are still collecting.
Gump, a time-hopping fable starring Tom Hanks, offers 2 1/2 hours of
mind-boggling special effects: see our hero chat and shake hands with
President Kennedy in glorious trick news-footage] In turn, Lion reawakens
the Disney wildlife menagerie years after the studio first struck gold with
The Jungle Book.
Either of these family-appeal fantasies could end up giving Jurassic Park
(now on video) a run for its millions as the highest-grossing film ever, so
are we all entering second childhood?
Probably: since the third US hit now picking UK pockets - and for me the
best of them all - is Speed. It has Keanu Reeves, a bomb, a runaway bus and
the most ingeniously-wired suspense plot in years. For children, as the
publicists used to say, of all ages.
But then cinema is the place where we all go to lose years from our mental
ages.
When A Man Loves A Woman is one success story of the summer for grown-ups.
The powerful tale of a marriage wrecked by alcoholism is still showing in
movie houses across Britain. Go and see it, if only to decide how much money
to put on Meg Ryan for next year's best actress Oscar.
At London's National Film Theatre, no Oscars and no nine-figure revenues for
individual movies.
Instead: the annual Jewish Film Festival, opening with acclaimed French film
Mina Tannenbaum, and several programmes doing what the NFT does best:
guarding our audio-visual culture.
Look out for a 25th anniversary season of Monty Python memorabilia starting
this week: much of the now-classic material once thought lost from the TV
archives.
For VCR viewers, it is time to lay in stocks for the long evenings to come.
Tom Hanks is in Oscar-winning pre-Gump form in the video-released
Philadelphia, as a prejudice-battling Aids sufferer. Hearts Of Darkness is
an hypnotic feature-length documentary about the making of Apocalypse Now
(better than the movie, pace Mr Coppola).
And the newly-restored Gone With The Wind is a snip at Pounds 15. It works
out at 1p a minute if you end up - and why should you not? - watching it six
times.
