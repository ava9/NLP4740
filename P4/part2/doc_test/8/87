A batch of Japanese consumer electronics groups reported weak sales and
depressed profits yesterday.
Matsushita Electric reported a sharp fall in pre-tax profits for the third
year running . It blamed continuing slow demand in key markets and the
strong rise of the yen against leading currencies.
The world's largest consumer electronics company suffered a 6 per cent drop
in consolidated sales, to Y6,624bn (Dollars 63.9bn) from a previous
Y7,056bn, while pre-tax profits declined 21 per cent to Y128.2bn from
Y162.2bn. Net income fell 34 per cent to Y24.5bn from Y37.3bn.
Matsushita said sales in the Japanese market were hit by slow consumer
spending and weak private capital expenditure. While innovative products,
such as high-tech rice cookers and washing machines, fared well, the
unusually cold summer last year knocked air conditioner sales, normally an
important contributor to revenues.
Meanwhile, overseas business was hit by the yen's appreciation. The
currency's rise led to a decline in overseas sales, which were up on a local
currency basis.
Sales of audio-visual equipment declined significantly due to a shift in
consumer preference for lower-priced products.
Sales of communication and industrial equipment fell, too. This was despite
strong demand for cordless and cellular phones, and largely because of weak
demand for industrial equipment as Japanese private businesses remained in
the doldrums.
Entertainment revenues, including sales from MCA, declined in yen terms.
They were, however, boosted in dollar terms by the huge success of the film
Jurassic Park. That film surpassed ET to become the highest grossing film of
all time, reaping Dollars 870m in box office revenues.
Parent company revenues declined 4 per cent to Y4,349.6bn from Y4,550bn, and
pre-tax profits fell 34 per cent to Y63.9bn from Y96.7bn. Net income was 15
per cent lower at Y43.2bn, against Y51bn.
The company expects the economic climate to remain depressed, but is looking
for a significant turnround in operating profit for this fiscal year. It is
carrying out manufacturing reforms overseas, increasing parts-procurement
from abroad, stepping up restructuring efforts and launching new, innovative
products. A director of Matsushita has been appointed president of Victor
Company of Japan (JVC), the troubled audio-visual company in which it has a
52 per cent stake. JVC, which introduced the VHS video cassette tape, has
appointed Mr Takeo Shuzui as president in place of Mr Takuro Bojo, who has
been at thehelm of JVC since 1991.
JVC has been hit by the slump in the consumer electronics market and has
incurred heavy losses. It is expected to report another loss when it
announces its results next week.
Pioneer, the audio-visual company, reported a 14 per cent drop in
consolidated sales, to Y509.9bn from Y589.7bn, and a 92 per cent plunge in
operating profits, to Y2.4bn from Y28.7bn, for the full year ended March.
Net income was down 30 per cent to Y6.6bn against Y10.8bn. Parent company
sales declined 15 per cent to Y326.4bn from Y382.8bn, and Pioneer incurred
an operating loss of Y5.7bn against Y6.9bn profit last time. Pre-tax profits
were Y1.7bn, down heavily from Y16.5bn.
Kenwood, the specialist audio maker, reported a Y1.2bn pre-tax loss, against
Y4bn profit for the same period last year, on sales down 6 per cent to
Y197.4bn from Y210.6bn.
