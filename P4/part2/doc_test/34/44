Dave Butz has reached the point in his football life where he's become the 
game. Free as a 305-pound bird, ready and seemingly eager to be bagged by the 
highest bidder, he may be the only player in National Football League history 
twice able to sell his services in a mostly unrestricted market. Coming to the 
Washington Redskins and, perhaps, going. 
</P>
<P>
Predictions about where Butz might play next season, if he plays at all, are 
oil-slick slippery. With two Super Bowl rings, he might be the sort of 
on-the-field and clubhouse presence a contender covets. He also might be a few 
hundred thousand dollars, or two twisted knees at defensive tackle, away from 
his 15th season as a Redskin. 
</P>
<P>
There is one certainty: this free-agent experience will not be remotely as 
rewarding as his last. The leverage this time is on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
As he expected, Butz did get a letter from the Redskins the other day. 
Registered no less. But it apparently was little more than a glorified howdy. 
Nowhere was there mention of a qualifying offer about next season's pay. 
</P>
<P>
For a man who will turn 39 about a month before any NFL training camp opens, 
this is not pleasant news. It means that the Redskins are fairly certain either 
27 other teams will not woo him with much passion or that he will not be a 
major factor if somebody does meet his price. 
</P>
<P>
While not putting it in writing, the Redskins are suggesting Butz could once 
more try to earn a place here -- but on their terms. It's demeaning, 
essentially making a man bigger in ways other than size beg for a job, but not 
to the degree that it seems at first glance. Even if he's let go, Butz has a 
parachute suitable for a man of his stature. 
</P>
<P>
Butz is in the phase-out portion of a gutty and lately glorious career; if they 
can get away with it, the Redskins will refuse to pay him regular wages 
(estimated at $500,000) for what might well be part-time work. Playing-time 
incentives always could be part of any contract at a drastically reduced base 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say the Redskins and everybody else insist the last member of the Over 
The Hill Gang actually is over the hill. A player with as much service as Butz 
is entitled to $150,000 in severance pay. It's the sort of league-wide gesture 
(earned through tough bargaining) once offered only by George Allen, the man ho 
brought Butz to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"It's big business, baby," Butz told The Washington Post's Tom Friend. "Here 
today, gone tomorrow. It doesn't matter how many times you played hurt. It 
doesn't make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Pro football certainly is a bigger business than when Butz arrived, though 
perhaps actually less cold to the hired hands. How long has Butz been around 
the Redskins? Well, about 14 years longer than lots of fans imagined and at 
least a few teammates hoped. When his colossally wide feet first dented 
Redskins' sod, in early August 1975, John Riggins was still a New York Jet. 
</P>
<P>
Free agents in the NFL were even less free when Butz made his escape from St. 
Louis. The price he fetched, two first-round draft choices and a No. 2, still 
is considered the largest compensation ever, wildly exorbitant even for Allen. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders and Redskins offered equally flattering contracts; double his 
salary with the Cardinals and all of it guaranteed, Butz said. Allen's offer 
was the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
What Allen paid in draft-choice terms seemed especially outrageous because Butz 
had missed all but one game the year before with as ugly a knee injury as 
anyone his weight can suffer. For many, the deal was typical Washington 
overspending -- Allen's answer to the $400 screwdriver. 
</P>
<P>
Butz is fairly certain some Redskins conspired against him almost as much as 
opposition guards and centers during his early years here. He thought it 
strange that his tackle partner, Diron Talbert, called so many audibles during 
combat that Butz never recognized. He would hesitate, just a fraction of a 
second, but long enough to be embarrassed and for Talbert's buddy, Bill 
Brundidge, to be sent into the game. 
</P>
<P>
So Butz more than anything has been a survivor. From serious knee surgery. From 
teammates trying to delay his ascent as long as possible. From coaches and 
players around the league who whispered he was not quite inspired enough to 
reach his full potential. He's outlasted nearly all his critics and 
contemporaries. Randy White, a child of 36, announced his retirement from the 
Cowboys last week. 
</P>
<P>
Butz can be enigmatic. Some friends thought he would retire gracefully after 
last season, when the Redskins seemed to be hinting that might be a fine idea 
after he set the record for consecutive games played; suddenly, he was talking 
not only about another season but also all but crawling to training camp. 
Incredibly, he described the scourge of all veterans, that annual intrusion 
into the offseason, mimicamp, as "fun." 
</P>
<P>
Often unapproachable, Butz can be delightful. After returning an interception 
26 yards, to the one-yard line, against the Bears in 1981, Butz said one of his 
concerns was being whistled for delay of game. He always adds that it took the 
offense two cracks to advance the ball that measly extra yard into the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
More than any Redskin, Butz has watched the experience he now faces. Business 
as usual in the business of sport.
