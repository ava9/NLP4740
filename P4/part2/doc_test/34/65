Bill Cosby has dropped a colorful mural shown during the opening credits of 
"The Cosby Show" in a dispute with a teacher whose Harlem students inspired the 
artwork. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute involves a mural painted on a Harlem building by students at the 
Creative Arts Workshop for Homeless Children, and a similar painting shown on 
the top-rated NBC series. 
</P>
<P>
The workshop's director, Brookie Maxwell, said the children who painted the 
original, "Street of Dreams," should get credit on the TV show and be paid if 
the idea is marketed. 
</P>
<P>
"I've ordered it taken off the show. It has nothing to do with the kids. Has to 
do with this woman, who is trying to hold us up," Cosby said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the principle of the thing," said Cosby, the highest-paid entertainer in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
NBC spokeswoman Rosemary O'Brien said three weeks of negotiations between the 
workshop and the show's producer, Carsey-Werner Co., had failed. 
</P>
<P>
"All we wanted was credit for the children," said Vivian Pollack, a lawyer for 
the workshop. "At no time did we make any specific financial demands, nor until 
last night did Cosby or Carsey-Werner offer any financial settlement."
