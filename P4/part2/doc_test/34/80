ABC's Emmy-winning series "The Wonder Years" and "China Beach," a CBS 
Schoolbreak Special entitled "My Past Is My Own," an installment of ABC's "New 
Adventures of Winnie the Pooh" and an ABC documentary on breast cancer, 
"Destined to Live," were all winners in the 15th annual Humanitas Prize 
competition, announced Thursday at the Century Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The Humanitas Prizes, sponsored by the Pacific Palisades-based Human Family 
Institute, are given each year to network television shows which exemplify 
"humanizing achievement in television writing." 
</P>
<P>
This year's awards were given in the following categories: 30-minute ($10,000); 
60-minute ($15,000), non prime-time childrens' live program ($10,000), 
children's animated program ($10,000) and documentary (no cash award). 
</P>
<P>
As was previously announced, for the first time in its history, there were no 
nominees -- and consequently no winners -- in the $25,000 category for TV 
movies. Judges said earlier that none of this season's movies was worthy of a 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
The winning "Wonder Years" episode, entitled "Pottery Will Get You Nowhere," 
was written by Matthew Carlson, and dealt with a conflict in the Arnold family 
that made son Kevin question the stability of the family. The "China Beach" 
episode "Promised Land," written by Patricia Green, explored racial conflict 
among the troops in Vietnam following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. CBS' "My Past Is My Own," written by Alan Gansberg, featured two 
teen-agers exploring their own histories. The "Winnie the Pooh" episode was 
written by Mike Zaslove, Doug Hutchinson and Larry Bernard; "Destined to Live" 
was penned by Sasha Ferrer. 
</P>
<P>
That the judges found no TV movies worth honoring is a symptom of what Father 
Ellwood Kieser, president of the Human Family Institute, calls "a period of 
transition and serious problems" in Hollywood. Kieser believes that increasing 
economic pressures on the networks caused by viewing alternatives such as cable 
and videocassettes, as well as recent corporate takeovers at the networks, have 
left the Big Three networks financially strapped and more likely to favor 
ratings over quality than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
"All three networks have changed ownership in recent months," Kieser said 
during remarks at the Humanitas Prize luncheon at the Century Plaza. "Those who 
bought them have incurred huge debts in the process. That means they are now 
saddled with staggering interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
"In some quarters, this has created a preoccupation with the bottom line that 
generates fear, stifles creativity and squeezes out value-oriented 
programming," Kieser said. "The tension between the creative and the economic 
is intrinsic to our business. But the situation seems worse now, much worse." 
</P>
<P>
Although all the networks, particularly NBC, blamed last summer's 154-day 
Writers Guild of America strike for some lapses in taste last season, Kieser 
said in an interview that the strike did not cause the current climate in 
Hollywood. "I really don't think that was the was the main ingredient," he 
said. "It's the pressure -- and it doesn't help to have one studio warring 
against another," he added, referring to the Paramount's ongoing attempt at 
hostile takeover of Time, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In response to that erosion of quality, Kieser announced at the luncheon that 
Humanitas will expand its educational program for Writers Guild members by 
adding a 10-week course to its current program of three yearly seminars on "the 
incorporation of human values into entertainment programming." Kieser also 
plans to launch a series of workshops for beginning writers to be conducted by 
master writers, "to facilitate the formation of writers' support groups and to 
arrange for a mentoring program for novice writers. And, Kieser said, the Human 
Family institute plans to increase incentive for screenwriters by upping the 
cash value of the prizes so that they stay current with inflation (the awards 
are still the same size they were 15 years ago), and become "comparable in the 
aggregate to the Nobel, Templeton and MacArthur prizes." 
</P>
<P>
he group also plans to expand the awards to include a PBS/cable television 
category and a feature film category, as part of a 10-year plan to foster 
responsibility to the public among Hollywood's writers. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood has consistently made 'human-values' (feature) films," Kieser said. 
" 'Rain Man,' for example, showed a greedy narcissistic human being who by the 
end of the film had become very loving." 
</P>
<P>
Kieser said that "human values" should not be mistranslated to mean family 
entertainment; nor is the new award an attempt to rid film of profanity, sex or 
violence. "A movie could contain rough language and still be full of human 
values," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kieser added that, while he believes the current trend of advertisers or 
advocacy groups boycotting television shows for language or content is their 
prerogative and does not represent censorship, Humanitas prefers to "nurture 
the good things" rather than try to force shows off the air. But "I don't think 
these (advocacy groups) are nutsies -- they just want shows on the air that 
they would want their kids to see," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kieser said the time frame for the new awards and programs has not been set. In 
part, it depends on another 10-year goal: to increase the current $1 million 
Humanitas endowment for the awards by $4 million, through donations from the 
independent producers, the major studios and the networks. 
</P>
<P>
Kieser has already secured some support from Marcy Carsey of Carsey/Werner, 
Grant Tinker of GTG Entertainment, Norman Lear and an independent producer who 
requested anonymity. They have all made 10-year pledges of $250,000. Alan 
Landsburg has pledged $200,000, David Milch $50,000, and the Finnegan/Pinchuk 
Company will donate $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic," Kieser said in the interview. "I think there is a keen 
awareness on the part of the entertainment community that they have a 
responsibility, not just to entertain, but to enrich. They give money not just 
because they have it, but because they know they owe it to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"So many of the poorer (TV) shows take you away from life, they are a 
narcotic," he added. "Shows which contain human values really inspire you to 
want to live it."
