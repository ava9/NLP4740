In the 1988 She's Having a Baby (KCOP Sunday at 6 p.m.), John Hughes, who seems 
to be crafting a comic valentine to approaching fatherhood, in a queasy mixed 
message, also shows marriage to be an uncontrollable, off-kilter horror. Kevin 
Bacon and Elizabeth McGovern star.

<P>
A Friendship in Vienna (KNBC Sunday at 7 p.m.) is a notable 1988 TV movie, that 
rare pleasure, a family film of maturity and substance centering on the 
friendship of two 13-year-old girls-one Jewish (Jenny Lewis), the other 
Catholic (Kamie Harper)-that endures the fall of Austria in 1938.

<P>
Allan Arkush's 1979 Rock 'n' Roll High School (KTLA Monday at 8 p.m.) is a 
rambunctious drive-in movie designed to show off those New Wave rockers the 
Ramones and drawing upon the old formula of rock-crazy kids in collision with a 
kill-joy principal; trouble is, this picture says it's OK to burn down the 
school if you don't get your way.

Even though the 1985 teen-sex comedy Secret Admirer (KCOP Monday at 8 p.m.) 
takes more cues from Georges Feydeau than Mad magazine, it loses its sparkle 
halfway through. C. Thomas Howell stars. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise (KTTV Wednesday at 8 p.m.) 
plays like a gross parody of the original, a funny and popular 1984 college 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
The Siege of Firebase Gloria (KCOP Wednesday at 8 p.m.), a 1989 release, is a 
rare and noteworthy example of the straightforward Vietnam combat action movie. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Lester's Class of 1984 (KTLA Friday at 8 p.m.) is a scary piece of pop 
art, envisioning a time when a teacher (Perry King) can be driven to pulling a 
gun to make his students pay attention. 
</P>
<P>
David Lynch's Dune, Part 1 (KTLA Saturday at 6 p.m.; Part II next Sunday at 6 
p.m.) is a vast, languorous 1984 science-fiction epic from the Frank Herbert 
cult classic set on a wasteland planet populated by gigantic worms. Kyle 
MacLachlan stars. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Hyams' 2010 (KTLA Saturday at 8 p.m.), the solidly entertaining rather 
than mystical sequel to R2001," finds Roy Scheider on a joint Soviet-American 
mission to find out what happened to the original "Discovery" flight.

KTLA.
