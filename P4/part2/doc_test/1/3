A VIEW FROM THE WINGS by Ronald Millar Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 18.99,
386 pages
THE STORY GOES, told by Sir Ronald Millar himself, that the day after
Margaret Thatcher resigned literary agents from around the world were on to
him non-stop to procure his help in seeking the lady's memoirs. In
exasperation, he said 'How about mine?' The next day one of them rang back
and said 'Why not?' A View From The Wings is the result.
Millar was the prime minister's speech-writer and (we now learn) a close
friend of the Thatcher family. He is the man who gave us such lines as 'The
Lady's not for Turning' at the 1980 Tory Party conference. He had also
written for Edward Heath and has dabbled with John Major. But it was clearly
Mrs Thatcher with whom he had the greatest rapport. Either she or one of her
colleagues invented the word 'Ronnification'. It meant that Millar had to be
sent for, often at the last minute, to put some spark - and a few jokes -
into a prepared text.
The practice worked very well. Whether you liked them or not, her conference
speeches were certainly striking, and Millar was helping her even before she
became prime minister. The interesting question is what made the
relationship click. Yet analysis is not Millar's strong point and he
provides no complete answer.
True, as he was told by CP Snow, he had the advantage of not being paid and
therefore not being a threat to anyone else's job. Millar also notes that
the first rule of speech-writing is to tailor the speech to suit the
speaker. Another is 'if stuck, go for a quote'. That is how he served Mrs
Thatcher. But he could not have done it if he had not been an actor and a
playwright, and the lady herself had not had a hankering for the stage. The
pair tended to address each other as 'dear' and sometimes even 'luv'. Some
of their exchanges recorded here seem distinctly camp. It must have helped
that Millar got on well with her main supporting partner, Denis Thatcher.
Between them they saw the funny side.
Even before he fell in with the Thatchers, Millar had a habit of landing on
his feet. His mother was widowed early and turned from amateur to
professional acting to make a living. There was never much money, but
usually an uncle to help with the school fees. In his youth Millar tumbled
on characters such as Ivor Novello and Noel Coward much as he later ran into
prime ministers. Even the now Norma Major was the nanny of the leading
actress in Millar's Robert and Elizabeth. She went off and married a Lambeth
councillor.
The book falls into two parts. The first half, about Millar's stage and
Hollywood career, is the more enjoyable because it tells a story that is not
widely known. Anecdotally, Millar has quite a lot to say about early wartime
Cambridge and his experience of the navy. This is a lesson which all writers
of memoirs should note: a life is not necessarily less interesting because
the character was not famous at the time.
By the time he comes to part two, on his association with Downing Street,
Millar is milking it a bit. We shall get better inside stories than this. He
also becomes remarkably reticent about himself. What was he doing when he
wasn't writing speeches for the prime minister? Few clues are offered.
Still, this is a happy book. John Major needs a speech-writer, too, but
probably Millar's not the man.
