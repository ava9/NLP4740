FAILURE IN BRITISH GOVERNMENT: THE POLITICS OF THE POLL TAX
By David Butler, Andrew Adonis and Tony Travers
Oxford University Press, Pounds 25 hbk, Pounds 7.99 pbk, 352 pages
This book, which chronicles the birth, life and death of the UK's poll tax,
is important, interesting and thorough. The authors have interviewed most of
the main people involved - including myself - and conclude that the policy
reveals shortcomings in the workings of the British government that
ultimately led to the toppling of Mrs Thatcher.
The book addresses three basic questions. First, why was it necessary to
devise a new form of local government tax? Second, why was the poll tax
selected? And third, why did it go so badly wrong?
The pledge to abolish domestic rates was made in the summer of 1974 by
Edward Heath, the then Conservative leader. But nothing was done about it. A
review of the rating system in 1979 when Margaret Thatcher became prime
minister led only to a reduction in the government grant to local
authorities.
By 1984 the position had become intolerable. It was difficult for the
government to get orders on grants to local authorities through the Commons
since the Treasury controls, of byzantine complexity, bore heavily on
Conservative councils. At the same time, certain Labour inner-city councils
were flouting the system by spending at record levels. The review that led
to the poll tax was put in hand, conducted by William Waldegrave and me as
environment ministers.
The central question was how much freedom a local authority should have. We
were looking for a robust and substantial tax base for local authorities
that would allow them to raise and spend their own money, and to answer for
it to their electorates.
The solution we came up with was a charge for local services, the community
charge - soon dubbed the 'poll tax'. It was based upon the principle that a
wider tax base was necessary because out of the 35m taxpayers only about 14m
paid rates; since many of these received rate rebates, only about 8m paid
rates in full.
The idea of a community charge was first mooted at Chequers, the prime
minister's country residence, in March 1985. It was envisaged that the
charge would be between Pounds 50 and Pounds 100 a head. If the people who
attended that crucial meeting had realised the poll tax would be levied at
nearly Pounds 300 a head in its first year, I am sure the proposal would
have been dropped.
The book is wrong, incidentally, to say those involved wanted 'to please
Margaret'. She had no clear views on what should replace rates, and her
enthusiasm for the poll tax flowered late.
Three things could have made the poll tax more bearable. First, a lower
level in the initial years, which would have meant introducing it in tandem
with rates. Such 'dual running' was abandoned after a debate at the
Conservative party conference in 1987. One should never allow the Tory party
conference to make policy - that is not its function.
Second, the exclusion from the tax of everybody below the age of 21 would
have taken the sting out of student protests. Unfortunately the purist
interpretation - that everyone over 18 had to pay - won the day.
And third, the central government grant to local authorities for 1990, the
first year of the poll tax, was utterly inadequate, and put further upward
pressure on its level.
The Treasury was not helpful: Nigel Lawson, then chancellor, opposed the
poll tax but was not prepared to block it. He was already at loggerheads
with the prime minister over the entry of sterling into the European
exchange rate mechanism and could not take on another issue.
That left Chris Patten, environment secretary in 1990, and me as
Conservative party chairman with the enormous problem of having to justify a
high and unpopular tax.
Did ministers fail? The poll tax was chosen after careful examination and
full discussion, which this book acknowledges.
One of the reasons it went so badly off the rails was that ministers
collectively were not looking at the political consequences. Cabinet
committees and the full cabinet examined the poll tax but in a fragmentary
way. There was no real political discussion.
Nor was parliament effective in scrutinising the impact of the tax. Attempts
to modify the legislation were viewed as destructive of the whole concept
and this made it even more difficult to get modest, but sensible, changes
accepted.
What, then, were the political consequences of this episode? I do not
believe it was the critical factor in Margaret Thatcher's fall. The 1990
local government elections showed councils such as Wandsworth and
Westminster could win majorities if the poll tax was low as a result of
lower expenditure. It was a good stick to beat Margaret Thatcher with, but
it did not match Sir Geoffrey Howe's resignation speech.
Where do we go from here? The present system of funding local government
based upon the council tax and tough central government controls is unlikely
to survive. It does not give local authorities the freedom they should have
and this will increase friction and hostility between local and central
government in future.
There is no easy answer by, for example, allocating a slice of income tax to
local government and calling it local income tax. If money is raised
centrally and simply allocated to local authorities, what is the purpose of
those authorities?
Lessons have certainly been learnt from the failure of the poll tax. But the
issue at the heart remains what it was - the powers of a centralised state
as opposed to the powers of a decentralised state. The issues raised by this
episode are not simply fiscal, they are also constitutional.
