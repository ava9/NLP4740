THATCHER'S TIME OF GRIM RE-EVALUATION

<TEXT>
<P>
In those bygone days when the European Parliament was known as the Cave of the 
Winds for all the effect-less speeches that stirred it, the conventional wisdom 
was that Europewide voting for members had only a tenuous connection with 
national politics. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts argued that last month's European Parliament elections, like 
municipal elections in some countries and presidential primaries in the United 
States, were based more on whim and temporary feeling than considered judgment 
or traditional alliances. Voters, in this analysis, could afford to adopt a 
devil-may-care approach because they could be sure the people they selected 
would not actually govern them. Certainly in the first two European Parliament 
elections, the Green parties and the far right did better than they did in 
national voting. 
</P>
<P>
After the debacle for her Conservative Party in the latest round of European 
voting, Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher must be hoping fiercely that 
this conventional wisdom still holds. While her Labor opponents, who had 
finished a sad second every other time they went against Thatcher, crowed that 
the end was nigh, the Tories were engaged in a grim re-evaluation of their 
European posture. 
</P>
<P>
European Community members with socialist governments, such as France and 
Spain, could barely conceal their glee. Variations of the headline "Is the Iron 
Lady Rusting?" appeared in a variety of languages. 
</P>
<P>
Britain has 81 of the 518 seats in the European Parliament. With the recent 
elections, the situation of the Conservatives and Labor were exactly reversed 
from the last balloting five years ago. Whereas the Conservatives had 
previously held 45 seats to Labor's 32, the score now is Labor 45, 
Conservatives 32. (The rest of the seats are filled by small regional parties.) 
</P>
<P>
Worse than that, the Conservative share of the total votes dropped to 34.2%, 
the lowest percentage in a nationwide poll during this century. It was the 
first national defeat for the Tories in 14 years. A Harris poll last Sunday in 
the Observer, which is no friend of the Thatcher government, gave Labor 48% of 
the vote to 34% for the Conservatives if a national election were held now. 
</P>
<P>
But it will be at least two years before Thatcher has to face such a test. She 
dismisses the Euroresults as temporary and trendless, a mere blip in her 
relentless progress. At last week's European Community summit she showed a 
slightly increased inclination to compromise, but no sign of contrition or any 
major policy shift. 
</P>
<P>
Analyses of the vote must also take into account the peculiarities of the 
British electoral system. The United Kingdom is the only one of 12 European 
Community countries to maintain voting by constituency rather than by 
proportional representation. That means voters in constituencies certain to go 
to one party or another are especially tempted to lodge protest votes for 
special-interest parties -- or to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's turnout of 37% was the lowest among the countries voting, compared 
with 47% in the Netherlands, 49% in France and 61% in West Germany. Yet high 
turnouts do not necessarily mean high acceptance of the European ideal. In 
Belgium, where 93% of those eligible voted, voting is compulsory with a fine 
rising to $100 for recalcitrants; in Italy, with an 88% turnout, failure to 
vote is entered on a citizen's "Certificate of Good Conduct," needed for some 
civil-service jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The British Green Party, making its first nationwide showing, enjoyed 
remarkable results, winning 14% of total votes cast. 
</P>
<P>
In some Tory country strongholds of southern England, the Greens actually came 
second, ahead of both Labor and what's left of the hapless Liberal-Social 
Democrat alliance. But although they won the highest vote percentage in the 
European environmental movement, the British Greens did not win a single seat 
because of the constituency system. The French Verts got 10.6% of the vote but 
won nine seats through proportional representation, while the German Greens 
came away with eight seats on 8.4% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, who began embracing environmental causes last fall after ignoring 
them for a decade, has implied that in a Tory-Labor showdown, the bulk of the 
Green vote would go to the Tories. It is certainly true that Labor has never 
stressed ecology -- directing its appeal instead to urban issues. However, it 
seems likely that the biggest cause of the Green surge was the disarray among 
the Liberals and Social Democrats, who had previously claimed the ecological 
issue as their campaign turf. 
</P>
<P>
In their projections for the next British general election, analysts must also 
factor in the lack of discipline among Labor ranks. Ideological splits, with 
socialists on the hard left attacking comfortable Social Democrats on the 
right, have more than once spoiled any prospect of a Labor victory. 
</P>
<P>
In his public appearances these days, Neil Kinnock, the Labor leader, stresses 
the need to adopt electable positions. But favorite Labor ideas, such as 
unilateral nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from European unity and 
renationalization of denationalized industries still keep popping up. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, most commentators pointed to Thatcher's uneasiness with European 
integration as the cause of her party's poor showing two weeks ago. The prime 
minister, in a series of scornful attacks, had spent much of the winter calling 
into question the next steps in the creation of a united Europe. She said the 
dropping of remaining trade barriers by the end of 1992 was fine, but that 
creation of a European central bank, a common currency and giving up a measure 
of national sovereignty for integration were "airy-fairy ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Such sentiments are common among small-scale businessmen fearing the arrival of 
hyper-markets, agribusiness and all the other appurtenances of expansion. The 
theory, however, is that in the Tories' high-tech party, Thatcher's protests 
were not heard by the voters. While party aides correctly observed that Labor's 
record has been even more anti-European than Thatcher's, it did seem that some 
of the traditional Conservative support was worried by the prime minister's 
recalcitrance. 
</P>
<P>
Socialists, including the British Labor Party, will be the largest bloc when 
the new European Parliament meets in Strasbourg, France, on July 25. 
</P>
<P>
Under the streamlined system adopted to speed the post-1992 market, the 
Parliament has a major voice in amending and approving enabling legislation. 
That could pit the parliamentary majority against those nations that have 
right-of-center governments, such powerful member countries as West Germany and 
Britain. If that turns out to be the case, then Thatcher's problems with Europe 
have barely begun.
