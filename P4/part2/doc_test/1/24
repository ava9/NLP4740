FT  16 APR 93 / Observer: Pique time?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by Lady Thatcher's performance this week, the former prime
minister's ability to catch the public mood is as uncanny as ever. But is
her high-level access to world leaders just as assured?
Certainly, she can still pull the big crowds on the international lecture
circuit, and her schedule in Warsaw, where she opens one of her Foundation's
offices tomorrow, sounds as hectic as ever. But there is some surprise that
President Lech Walesa is not on the Thatcher itinerary.
True, the Polish president tends to go home to Gdansk at weekends. But he
still likes to receive foreign big-wigs at his shipyard in order to
underline Poland's industrial possibilities. Indeed, Lady T popped in there
during her 1988 visit, much to the consternation of the ruling communists.
But it's understood that Walesa is too busy to see the Iron Lady this time
round. A sign that she - or Walesa - are past their prime?
