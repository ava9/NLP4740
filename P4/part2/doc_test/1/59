<F P=106> [Report by Sokhbet Mamedov: "Having Sent `Iron Lady' to New </F>
York, Geydar Aliyev Forms His Team"] 
  [Text] Baku -- Lola Gadzhiyeva, who aspired to the role of 
Azerbaijan's "Iron Lady" and who was until recently considered 
one of President Aliyev's closest associates, has been suddenly 
removed from her post of republic secretary of state and 
appointed Azerbaijan's permanent representative to the United 
Nations. She was number two in the republic. 
  But her unexpected decision last November to leave the "New 
Azerbaijan" party, whose chairman is Aliyev, and found her own, 
liberal democratic, party, was a sure sign of the divergence of 
positions among the president's inner circle. And this is the 
result -- Gadzhiyeva is on her way to New York, while 
parliamentary speaker Rasul Guliyev moves into second place in 
the republic's political hierarchy. 
  Among the numerous contenders for the vacant post of 
secretary of state people are mentioning the names of Gasan 
Gasanov, the republic's current foreign minister, Ramiz Rizayev, 
Azerbaijani ambassador to Moscow, and Arif Ragimzad, adviser on 
territorial administration. Most observers are inclined to 
think that the president will settle on Gasanov as his choice 
and that the new secretary of state's sphere of activity will be 
limited to foreign policy. 
  The Azerbaijani president has set about forming his team in 
earnest. "I did not have one when I returned to Baku," Aliyev 
admitted to IZVESTIYA's correspondent. "The first appointments 
were made merely with the aim of preventing a total collapse of 
leadership at local level. My aim is to attract capable and 
talented young people into governing the republic."
