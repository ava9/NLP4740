  [Text] Beijing, April 29 KYODO -- A North Korean diplomat 
said Friday [29 April] the replacement of spent fuel rods at a 
nuclear power plant cannot be postponed and replacement of the 
rods will go ahead with or without the oversight of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  "If the production of electricity is to continue, then it is 
necessary to change the fuel rods... The matter of changing the 
fuel rods is in no way related to the agency (IAEA)," said Tae 
Chong-chae, a minister at the North Korean embassy in Beijing. 
  Last week North Korea invited IAEA inspectors to view the 
removal of the rods at an experimental nuclear reactor at 
Yongbyon, a key nuclear facility suspected by the west of 
producing weapons grade plutonium. 
  The IAEA has yet to respond to the invitation and is 
awaiting 
Pyongyang's response to IAEA demands concerning the history of 
the plant. 
  A team of IAEA inspectors sent to North Korea in March 
returned to their home base in Vienna claiming that North Korean 
officials had interfered with their two-week inspection, leading 
to a further deterioration in the yearlong standoff over 
Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons program.
