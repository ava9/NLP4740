South Korea's foreign minister said yesterday North Korea would be given
more time to solve its dispute over nuclear inspections, even if the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) declares that Pyongyang is in
violation of nuclear safeguards, writes John Burton in Seoul.
The US and South Korea have previously stated that the North Korean nuclear
issue would be transferred to the United Nations Security Council once the
IAEA declared that the continuity of its inspections of the North's nuclear
facilities had been broken. The UN would then consider imposing economic
sanctions on Pyongyang.
Mr Hans Blix, the IAEA director general, said on Thursday that the
continuity of the inspection regime was close to being broken. He is
expected to deliver a report on North Korean nuclear issue to the Security
Council next week.
Mr Han Sung-joo, the South Korean foreign minister, said the timing of the
UN involvement depended not only on technical factors, such as an IAEA
declaration that its safeguards on North Korean are broken, but also on
diplomatic developments.
North Korea is now blocking routine IAEA inspections of its nuclear
facilities at Yongbyon.
