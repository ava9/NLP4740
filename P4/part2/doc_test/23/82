  [Text] Vienna, May 19 (AFP) -- IAEA [International Atomic 
Energy Agency] inspectors in North Korea to find out if that 
country is making nuclear weapons, have visited an experimental 
reactor and a radiochemical laboratory at the Yongbyon nuclear 
complex and will continue their inspection Friday [20 May], an 
IAEA spokesman said Thursday. 
  Hans-Friedrich Meyer would not comment on a report by THE 
WASHINGTON POST that the reclusive Stalinist country had begun 
removing spent fuel rods from the reactor at the Yongbyon 
nuclear complex in defiance of international warnings not to do 
so. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) receives daily 
reports from the inspectors, he said, adding that IAEA member 
countries were kept informed "in confidence" about what was in 
the reports. 
  He said the inspectors were tasked only with maintenance 
work 
consisting in verifying seals placed on the reactor and 
replacing films and batteries in cameras monitoring the nuclear 
site. 
  The United Nations and the United States have warned 
Pyongyang not to remove the fuel rods before the IAEA inspectors 
can check them to see if fissile material has been diverted to 
make a nuclear weapon. 
  For this purpose they will also take samples in the 
radiochemical lab. 
  Sources familiar with a preliminary report filed by the IAEA 
team had told the POST that defueling at the Yongbyon reactor, 
90 kilometers (54 miles) north of Pyongyang, was in its early 
stage, meaning that only a small portion of the estimated 8,000 
plutonium- laden fuel rods had been removed. 
  North Korea's continued refusal to abide by the IAEA's non- 
proliferation rules has led to international threats of UN 
sanctions, which in turn prompted war threats from Pyongyang. 
  U.S. Defense Secretary, William Perry, said Wednesday that 
his government faced "a very substantial near-term crisis" with 
North Korea.
