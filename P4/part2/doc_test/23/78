<F P=106> [Editorial: "What is North Korea Thinking Of?"] </F>
  [Text] North Korea, which is suspected of developing 
nuclear weapons, announced that it will immediately withdraw 
from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and issued a 
statement rejecting all nuclear inspections. These actions will 
deepen suspicions about North Korea's nuclear weapons 
development and heighten tensions on the Korean peninsula. The 
situation has worsened to the point where we have to really 
worry. 
  North Korea has completed the removal of all the fuel rods 
from a five-megawatt experimental atomic reactor in defiance of 
the IAEA's demand for halting the action. In reaction, the IAEA 
has voted to adopt a resolution imposing "sanctions" against 
North Korea that include suspending technological cooperation. 
North Korea has reacted to the IAEA's sanctions by announcing 
its withdrawal from the IAEA. North Korea's reaction was beyond 
our anticipation. 
  Meanwhile, North Korean President Kim Il-song recently told 
an American expert: "If issues, including normalizing relations 
between North Korea and the United States, are settled as a 
package deal and the United States provides us with assistance 
in our effort to shift to light-water atomic reactors, we will 
be willing to freeze our nuclear program." 
  If North Korea quits the IAEA, it will obviously become 
impossible for both the United States and North Korea to hold 
dialogue and spur debates on a resolution in the UN Security 
Council on imposing sanctions against North Korea. We would 
like to ask North Korea: "What on Earth are you thinking of?." 
  We would like to focus on two points of North Korea's recent 
statement. 
  First, North Korea has announced that it will quit the IAEA, 
but it has not expressed its intention to withdraw from the 
Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT). 
  North Korea joined the NPT in 1985 and signed a safeguards 
agreement with the IAEA in 1992 to accept nuclear inspections. 
In March 1993, however, North Korea rejected an IAEA demand for 
special nuclear inspections of two undeclared nuclear facilities 
in Yongbyon and then announced that it would quit the NPT. 
Later, following talks with the United States, North Korea 
expressed its intention to temporarily suspend its withdrawal 
from the NPT. Since then, North Korea has taken the stand that 
it accepts only bona-fide nuclear inspections while maintaining 
that it holds a "special status" while it delays withdrawal from 
the NPT. 
  If North Korea quits the IAEA and rejects all nuclear 
inspections, this means it remains in the NPT without having 
nuclear inspections. This is a flagrant violation of the NPT. 
The "special status" theory, which North Korea has expounded, 
is no longer convincing. 
  Second, North Korea's rejection of all nuclear inspections 
would make it impossible to determine whether or not it has 
developed nuclear weapons in the past or has diverted plutonium 
extracted from fuel rods to nuclear weapons development. North 
Korea's rejection of all nuclear inspections would also make it 
impossible to check that country's nuclear program in the 
"future." 
  How should the international community deal with North 
Korea's dangerous actions? 
  What is important is that the international community should 
deal coolly with the North Korean nuclear issue and take a 
resolute attitude without overreacting to any of North Korea's 
actions. 
  To that end, the international community needs to find out 
what North Korea's real intentions are, and sensibly monitor 
North Korean signals. Former U.S. President Carter will be 
visiting North Korea. Liberal Democratic Party members will also 
be visiting Pyongyang following a visit by Social Democratic 
Party of Japan members. They will have a good opportunity to 
feel out their real intentions. 
  Since North Korea wants to resolve the nuclear issue through 
dialogue with the United States, the United States should not 
close the channel for dialogue. It is important for the United 
States to cooperate with the UN Security Council and other 
nations. 
  The role to be played by China, North Korea's most friendly 
ally, is increasingly growing important. During his meeting 
with Choe Kwang, visiting General Staff chief of the Korean 
People's Army, Chinese President Jiang Zemin stressed the 
inseparability of China and North Korea, describing Sino-North 
Korean relations as "teeth and lips." North Korea cannot 
maintain itself for a long period without China's supplies of 
oil and spare parts for weapons. 
  China has frequently advocated "peace and stability" on the 
Korean peninsula and the "denuclearization" of the Korean 
peninsula. North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA may jeopardize 
this. We hope that China will seriously persuade North Korea.
