  [Text] Washington, May 11 (YONHAP) -- The International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will likely conduct additional 
inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities at Yongbyon early 
next week since Pyongyang has already accepted the UN nuclear 
watchdog's request to send inspectors to complete checks at a 
radiochemical laboratory in the complex. 
  North Korea's Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations, Kim 
Chong-su, told YONHAP in a telephone interview Wednesday that 
his country welcomed nuclear inspectors anytime. 
  He confirmed publicly for the first time that the North has 
not gone ahead with refueling of the 5-megawatt nuclear reactor, 
which it had earlier threatened to do without IAEA supervision 
when the UN body demanded to take samples of spent fuel rods. 
  The IAEA director-general sent a telex to North Korean 
Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam on Tuesday proposing to send an 
inspection team to complete work at the nuclear reprocessiong 
plant in Yongbyon that was blocked during its previous visit in 
March. 
  The UN nuclear watchdog, however, made it clear that the 
communist country should delay removal of fuel rods from the 5- 
megawatt reactor until later this year. 
  Diplomatic sources in the U.S. capital said North Korea has 
already prepared visas for the IAEA inspection team and 
predicted that the inspectors would arrive in Pyongyang by this 
weekend and begin their task early next week. 
  Kim, in the telephone interview, offered assurances that the 
stalinist regime has not removed any spent fuel. 
  "We cannot delay removal of the spent fuel rods forever, for 
the sake of our safety, and we have to change the fuel rods 
because the situation is like a red light that is on in a car 
signaling it is running out of oil," he said. 
  Now that North Korea and the IAEA have settled their row 
over 
changing the fuel rods, Washington is expected to schedule a 
third round of high-level talks with Pyongyang after the 
additional nuclear inspections are carried out.
