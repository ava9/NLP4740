  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu and Hans Blix, chief of the U.N.'s nuclear 
monitoring agency, agreed Tuesday [12 April] that North Korea 
must permit the completion of inspections initiated last month 
on its suspect nuclear program. Han, on a weeklong diplomatic 
mission to Russia, Britain, and Belgium, arrived in Tokyo on 
Tuesday and met with Blix, director general of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who is here for a forum starting 
Wednesday in Hiroshima on the peaceful uses of atomic energy. 
  Blix and Han, during their hour-long meeting, studied 
Pyongyang's response to the U.N. Security Council's March 31 
presidential statement urging North Korea to comply with the 
nuclear safeguards accord and permit the conclusion of the 
checks, the South Korean Embassy in Japan said. 
  The IAEA has said two weeks of inspections in March were 
insufficient to decide whether Pyongyang has diverted nuclear 
materials for weapons purposes as alleged by the United States 
and other Western nations. 
  North Korea says it has fully complied with inspection 
criteria previously agreed upon and maintains its nuclear 
program serves strictly civilian purposes. 
  The nuclear row will top Han's agenda in Moscow, where he 
will meet Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and other 
government leaders from Wednesday through Friday. 
  "I expect Moscow to bring up its earlier proposal for an 
eight-way conference on the North Korean nuclear issue and I 
will explain Seoul's position," YONHAP NEWS AGENCY quoted Han as 
saying before departure. Moscow has suggested that both Koreas, 
China, the U.S., Russia, Japan, the United Nations and the IAEA 
try to resolve the nuclear controversy through a special 
conference. 
  According to YONHAP, Han said Seoul welcomes the Russian 
proposal but prefers that the U.N. handle the North Korean issue 
for the time being. 
  Han is scheduled to meet British Foreign Secretary Douglas 
Hurd in London on Saturday and will return to Seoul next Monday 
after attending a two-day conference of South Korean mission 
chiefs in Brussels.
