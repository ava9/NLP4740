song's news conference with foreign reporters at the Kumsusan 
Assembly Hall in Pyongyang on 16 April; Kim's remarks in Korean 
are translated from Japanese subtitles] 
  [Text] North Korean President Kim Il-song held a news 
conference today with a group of foreign reporters, including 
members of the NHK. In the news conference, President Kim 
Il-song commented on North Korean nuclear facilities, where the 
DPRK is suspected of developing nuclear weapons, and said that 
no country is making its military facilities open to the general 
public. In this way, he stressed again that the DPRK has no 
intention to accept inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency. 
  The news conference was held at the Kumsusan Assembly Hall, 
where President Kim Il-song's presidential office is located, 
for nearly three hours starting at 1000 [0100 GMT] this morning. 
  [Begin Kim Il-song recording] We have nothing to hide at 
all. We have no secrets. However, we have military secrets. It 
is normal for every country to hide its military matters. We 
will make everything, except for the military matters, open to 
the general public. [end recording] 
  In this way, President Kim Il-song stressed again that the 
DPRK has no intention to accept inspections of the two 
facilities in Yongbyon, which are main targets of the nuclear 
suspicion. Moreover, President Kim Il-song said: We have been 
saying that we have neither the intention nor the capability of 
building nuclear weapons. It is unlikely that we will ever own 
nuclear weapons. 
  In this way, he denied the suspected nuclear weapons 
development. On the other hand, President Kim Il-song repeatedly 
said that he hopes to visit the United States someday. 
  [Begin Kim Il-song recording] Although I have never been to 
the United States, I think a day will come for me to go there. 
[ends recording] 
  This was the first time for President Kim Il-song to 
disclose 
his hope to visit the United States. 
  [Begin recording by an unidentified NHK reporter in 
Pyongyang] President Kim Il-song gave us very strong 
impressions. One of them is the fact that he looked very 
healthy. Although he is 82 years old, he energetically spoke 
for three hours and ate well. He did not look tired at all. In 
response to a question what he will do when he goes to the 
United States, the president said: I have nothing to learn from 
the United States because I am not young anymore. However, I 
would like to go fishing and hunting. It will be a fruitful 
visit in many respects. 
  International attention is focused on how President Kim 
Il-song will settle the difficult situation. [end recording]
