FT  06 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Equifax in talks with UAPT advisers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equifax, the US credit information business, is having talks with the
advisers to UAPT-Infolink with a view to seeking a recommendation for its
increased cash offer of 600p per share for the UK credit referencing
company.
Equifax announced a 500p recommended offer on July 26, but it was pre-empted
by a rival 550p bid on Wednesday from Trans Union, another North American
credit information business. Equifax responded with the 600p offer, but
despite UAPT board support for the 500p bid, the increased offer has not
been recommended.
