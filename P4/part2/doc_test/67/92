FT  04 MAR 94 / Shipping to Europe boosts UK ports' business

Associated British Ports, the UK's largest ports group, says it is
attracting an increasing amount of trans-shipment business, with cargo being
landed at Southampton and then shipped on to Europe.
Rotterdam has traditionally dominated the European trans-shipment business,
but ABP said UK ports had become much more competitive since the abolition
of the National Dock Labour Scheme in 1989.
Sir Keith Stuart, ABP's chairman, said industrial relations in the UK docks
had gone from being the worst in Europe to the best, and ports could take
cargo at any time of the day and night, seven days a week - unlike many
continental competitors.
Of the 350,000 containers landed at Southampton last year, 50,000 were
trans-shipped to Europe - up from negligible levels only two years ago.
Other UK ports such as Felixstowe have seen a smaller growth in
trans-shipments, but Southampton is particularly well placed on the
so-called 'Atlantic Rim', which includes ports in Ireland, France, Portugal
and Spain.
ABP yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 62.1m in the year to
December 31. The previous year it made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 36.6m,
mainly because of a write-down of Pounds 83.6m on its property portfolio.
The group plans a 1-for-1 scrip issue, its third since flotation in 1983.
ABP shares closed down 1p at 570p.
One indication of ABP's continuing pressure on labour costs was a redundancy
charge of Pounds 8.1m, compared with Pounds 4m the previous year. The 200
jobs shed last year reduced the number of the group's dockers to 1,700 -
compared with 3,000 before the abolition of the dock labour scheme. Sir
Keith estimated redundancy costs would be about Pounds 2m in the current
year.
The higher redundancy charges mainly accounted for the fall in operating
profits from ports and transport operations from Pounds 60.7m to Pounds
55.9m, although the group said the reduced costs would benefit profit
margins from the current year onwards.
Sir Keith said the ports business was improving in the second half and this
had been 'more than sustained' in the first two months of this year.
Port-related property income was flat at Pounds 20.7m but property
investment increased profits to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 9.1m). Gearing fell
from 60 per cent to 53 per cent.
Earnings per share were 25.5p compared with losses of 14.3p. A final
dividend of 5.8p (5.25p) gives a total for the year of 9.3p (8.5p), an 8 per
cent rise.
