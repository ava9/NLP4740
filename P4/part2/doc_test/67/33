Trans Com Systems, an Irvine manufacturer of stereo and movie systems for 
airplanes, will be sold to Sony Corp. for more than $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Selling was Sundstrand Corp., a Rockford, Ill., defense contractor hit recently 
with $198.6 million in fines and payments to settle a federal investigation of 
defense contract fraud. 
</P>
<P>
There was speculation Sundstrand may have agreed to sell Trans Com to raise 
cash, but a spokesman said that is not the case. Instead, he said, Sundstrand 
sold the unit because it could no longer compete effectively. 
</P>
<P>
Trans Com has encountered a much more difficult market since the Japanese 
company Matsushita decided to sell its own stereo and movie equipment directly 
to airlines, bypassing a Trans Com competitor that had packaged Matsushita's 
systems for sale. 
</P>
<P>
By selling directly to the airlines, Matsushita was able to undersell Trans Com 
and other companies in the market. 
</P>
<P>
So Sundstrand decided to sell, since its "philosophy is to be the market leader 
in almost every business we're in," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Sony should do better with the unit since it already supplies Trans Com with 
70% of its video and audio components. All the major airlines are customers, 
said the Sundstrand spokesman, and Trans Com had sales of $40 million last 
year. The company employs 260. 
</P>
<P>
The sale must be approved by both companies' boards. MICHAEL FLAGG
