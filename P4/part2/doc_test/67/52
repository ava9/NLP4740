FT  08 DEC 94 / Rival bids for VSEL to face monopolies inquiry

Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday referred
bids from both British Aerospace and GEC for the submarine-maker VSEL to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The decision surprised the City, which
had confidently expected both bids to be cleared. VSEL's share price fell
sharply from Pounds 15.35 to Pounds 13.35.
Such a double referral is highly unusual. The last time a similar event
happened was in 1989 when a joint bid by GEC and Siemens for Plessey, the
electronics company, was passed to the commission. That bid was eventually
cleared.
Mr Heseltine referred GEC's bid on the grounds of competition because GEC
already owns the other large UK warship yard at Yarrow on the Clyde. This
was in line with the recommendation of the Office of Fair Trading's
director-general, Sir Bryan Carsberg. BAe's bid was not referred on
competition but on other public interest grounds, according to the
Department of Trade and Industry.
However, City observers said the government was taking the line of least
resistance. 'Once the OFT had recommended that GEC was referred, then I
think both companies were always going to the MMC,' said one analyst. 'It
was the easiest thing to do.'
Another said he thought a reference was 'a waste of time and money. One of
these companies is going to end up owning VSEL and they might as well have
fought it out in the market. But I do think the government is also sending a
signal that it would not welcome a closer link between BAe and GEC.'
The defence procurement minister, Mr Roger Freeman, is tonight giving a
speech which advocates stronger ties between European defence companies, a
shift away from the traditional policy of national autonomy.
The speech also appears to argue against a link-up between BAe and GEC. Both
bids automatically lapse as a result of the referral. The commission has
been given until March 15 to make recommendations about whether the bids
should be allowed to proceed.
British Aerospace said last night it was disappointed but it would fight its
case through the MMC inquiry, and was confident it could satisfy any
concerns the commission might have.
GEC will decide in the next few days whether to pursue its bid through the
three-month investigation, the company said.
VSEL's chief executive, Mr Noel Davies, said he was disappointed by the
decision because it meant that his workforce and shareholders would be left
with uncertainty.
Behind the scenes, however, several executives close to the bid were
expressing their anger at what they regarded as the government taking the
easy way out.
BAe's shares fell 4p to 433p, GEC's shares rose 2.5p to 275.5p.
