FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Coats cleared to bid for Tootal

THE OFFICE of Fair Trading has cleared the way for Coats Viyella to pursue
its Pounds 194m hostile takeover bid for Tootal, another of the UK's leading
textile groups, by recommending that the bid should not be referred to the
Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission.
The MMC conducted an investigation into the prospective merger between Coats
and Tootal two years ago after the two companies agreed terms for a friendly
merger. The Pounds 395m agreed bid lapsed during the MMC investigation.
Coats waited until March this year to make another offer, this time on a
hostile basis.
The current bid was put on ice during the OFT's investigation. Tootal, which
is fighting fiercely against the bid, now has two days - until Saturday - in
which to issue any new information to its shareholders.
Tootal plans to publish details of a profits forecast - covering profits
before and after tax together with earnings per share - for the year to
January 31.
It will also release details of 'specific projects' for its core businesses
intended to 'improve profitability significantly' in the next financial
year.
Coats, which already owns 29.4 per cent of Tootal, yesterday demanded that
it produce a balance sheet and cashflow statement for the 1990-91 financial
year. Coats also asked for further details of the Pounds 23m extraordinary
restructuring costs that Tootal included in its recently released
preliminary results.
Tootal, which was forced by the timing of Coats' bid to bring forward the
publication of its preliminary results so that it could include them in its
defence document, said it would wait until its annual report came out at the
usual time in May to produce the balance sheet and cashflow statement.
For weeks the stock market has been speculating that Coats would make a
second offer after Tootal has issued its profits forecast.
Tootal's shares, which rose above Coats' original offer of 65p cash shortly
after the bid in anticipation of a second offer, were unchanged at 76p
yesterday. Coats' shares also ended the day unchanged at 140p.
