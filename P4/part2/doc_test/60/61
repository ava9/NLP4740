  [Text] Moscow, 25 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The Russian Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs today expressed hope that Tsutomu Hata's 
election as Japan's prime minister will promote "the positive 
development of the whole range of bilateral relations and 
consistent and constructive movement toward genuine partnership 
and good-neighbourliness on the basis of the strategic policy 
laid down during the Russian-Japanese summit meetings." 
  In a conversation with the ITAR-TASS correspondent, a 
high-ranking official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Russian Federation reaffirmed Moscow's immutable policy toward 
the development of comprehensive relations with Japan on the 
basis of the Tokyo Declaration adopted during Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo last October. Koji Watanabe, 
Japan's ambassador to Russia, expressed a similar stand in a 
recent interview to ITAR-TASS. 
  The Russian diplomat recalled that during Tsutomu Hata's 
visit to Moscow last month while in the posts of deputy prime 
minister and minister of foreign affairs, "the positive mood 
that has been predominant in Russian-Japanese relations recently 
was very clearly demonstrated". 
  The foreign ministry official noted that the two sides "face 
a major task to fill in specific details to the agreements 
reached in Tokyo last October and to bring them to a practical 
level." He expressed hope that "this work will succeed through 
joint efforts in line with the key interests of the Russian and 
the Japanese people." 
  The Russian diplomat said that "active political dialogue 
with Japan, including top level contacts, will help" to achieve 
these aims. He recalled that an invitation to visit Russia was 
handed to the Japanese prime minister last October and confirmed 
in March; it remains in force despite the change of government 
in Japan. Bearing in mind that the Russian head of state 
visited Japan last year, the diplomat said, it is now the turn 
of the Japanese. 
  According to the high-ranking official from the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, "there is every reason to look with optimism 
at the future of Russian-Japanese relations, even though both 
sides will naturally have to make intense efforts to further 
these relations -- a point on which the two countries see eye to 
eye."
