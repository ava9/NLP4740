  [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- A spokesman for the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed the belief that following 
the establishment of Japan's new government, China and Japan 
will continue to maintain their close coordination and 
cooperation and will work together to promote the long-term and 
steady development of the two countries' relations. 
  The spokesman made the statement while answering a 
reporter's 
question at a news conference held this afternoon. 
  The reporter asked: Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is now 
forming his cabinet, what is your comment? What do you expect 
from the new Japanese Government? 
  The spokesman said: Premier Li Peng has sent a 
congratulatory message to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. Mr. Hata 
is a statesman with whom the Chinese people are familiar. "We 
appreciate the zeal and foresight he has demonstrated in 
strengthening Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation, as well 
as the great deal of work he has accomplished for this purpose. 
Ruling and nonruling parties in Japan share a common 
understanding toward the development of reciprocal and 
cooperative relations between China and Japan in all fields. We 
believe that, following the establishment of the new Japanese 
Government, China and Japan will continue to maintain their 
close coordination and cooperation and will work together in 
promoting the long-term and steady development of the two 
countries' relations."
