  [Text] Tokyo, 11 Apr (XINHUA) -- At a meeting at the prime 
minister's residence today with Wang Xiaoxian, vice president of 
the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign 
Countries [CPAFFC] and of the China-Japan Friendship 
Association, Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said his 
recent visit to China was a great success. 
  According to the Japanese prime minister, he was very 
pleased 
with his fruitful talks with President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li 
Peng, and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji during his recent visit to 
China. 
  Today, Tsutomu Hata, Japanese deputy prime minister and 
concurrently minister of foreign affairs, met with Wang Xiaoxian 
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Hata said: We must ensure 
good Sino-Japanese relations because they are very important for 
peace and stability in Asia and the world as a whole. Hata 
disagreed with the so-called theory of Chinese threat, which was 
spread by some people. 
  Wang Xiaoxian and the CPAFFC delegation he led also met 
separately with Koshiro Ishida, director general of management 
and coordination; Satsuki Eda, director general of science and 
technology; Ryoko Akamatsu, minister of education; Kanju Sato, 
minister of home affairs; Yohei Kono, president of the Japan 
Liberal Democratic Party; and some Diet members. 
  The CPAFFC delegation arrived in Tokyo on 6 April on a visit 
to Japan at the invitation of Japan's Soka Society.
