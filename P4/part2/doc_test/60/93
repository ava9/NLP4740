  [Text] Tokyo, 2 Jun (XINHUA) -- The 13th Sino-Japanese 
diplomatic consultations were held here on 1 June. Chinese Vice 
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and Japanese Deputy Foreign 
Minister Hiroshi Fukuda attended the meeting. 
  According to information released by the Japanese Foreign 
Ministry, Chinese and Japanese diplomats candidly exchanged 
views on bilateral relations and the international situation. 
Both sides shared the view that it is necessary to further 
develop bilateral relations on the basis of future requirements 
so as to contribute to the Asia-Pacific region and the world as 
a whole. 
  During the consultations, the Japanese side, in referring to 
comments by former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano denying the 
Rape of Nanjing, reiterated that Japan would, in a spirit of 
remorse for the past, continue to exert efforts to make 
bilateral relations more mature. The Chinese side affirmed the 
wisdom of the Japanese Government and Prime Minister Hata in 
handling Nagano's comments, pointing out that correctly dealing 
with the past is the basis for developing Sino-Japanese 
relations, and it expressed its hope that similar events will 
not occur again in the future. 
  The two sides also exchanged views on bilateral economic 
relations and economic cooperation, as well as the international 
situation, including the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.
