  [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- Japanese Ambassador Toshio 
Goto told Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu Saturday morning that 
the Hata cabinet's view of history mirrors that of the previous 
Hosokawa cabinet. 
  Conveying the Japanese response to Seoul's official protest 
against remarks made by Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano in 
defense of Tokyo's role in World War II, Ambassador Goto said he 
had been instructed to clarify that the Hata cabinet attaches 
importance to promoting a future-oriented bilateral relationship 
and an honest view of history, Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang 
Ki-ho said. 
  Goto told Han he had conveyed Seoul's concern to his home 
government, adding that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata would take 
appropriate action on Nagano's remarks upon returning from 
Europe Sunday. Tokyo will notify Seoul of any action, he added. 
  Minister Han told the ambassador that the justice minister's 
remarks had hurt and angered Koreans and that the Japanese 
Government should move to heal this hurt and prevent the 
recurrence of such remarks, Chang said.
