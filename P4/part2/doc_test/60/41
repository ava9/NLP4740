Japan's controversial justice minister, Mr Shigeto Nagano, resigned over the
weekend, just 10 days after taking office, after denying that an infamous
wartime atrocity happened.
He was replaced by Mr Hiroshi Nakai, a centre-right member of the lower
house, who immediately tried to calm the row by saying that it was
'undeniable' that the Japanese army 'committed cruel acts' in the war.
Mr Nagano had earlier retracted his remarks, in which he said that Japan's
invasions of China - now its second largest trade partner - and other Asian
neighbours were not acts of aggression. However, the retraction only partly
appeased the anger of South Korea and was dismissed as inadequate by Japan's
opposition parties, which plan to exploit the blunder to the full.
Mr Nagano offered his resignation after meeting the prime minister, Mr
Tsutomu Hata, on Saturday.
Mr Nakai is a member of the Democratic Socialist party, a minor partner in
the five-party government coalition. Mr Hata chose him to avert opposition
criticism that the alliance was dominated by the right-wing Japan Renewal
party, which now has seven out of 21 cabinet seats. Mr Hata heads the JRP
and Mr Nagano is a member.
South Korea welcomed Mr Hata's decision. 'It is difficult for both the
victim and the perpetrator to overcome the past,' said a South Korean
foreign ministry official. Mr Hata's decision showed courage, he said.
However, Mr Hata's domestic opponents plan to pursue him after he faces
parliament to make his first policy speech tomorrow, when his comments on
Japan's wartime responsibility will be closely followed.
Mr Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic party, the biggest
opposition group, said Mr Hata bore 'great responsibility' for having
appointed Mr Nagano. The affair had jeopardised the efforts made by former
LDP governments to improve ties with Asian neighbours, said Mr Yoshiro Mori,
its secretary general.
