  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata today contacted Chinese and South Korean leaders to 
apologize for former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's remarks 
shrugging off Japan's wartime atrocities before and during World 
War II. 
  Hata said in a written message to Chinese Premier Li Peng 
and 
a telephone call to S. Korean President Kim Yong-sam that 
Nagano's statement caused pain and anger to the peoples of 
Japan's Asian neighboring countries, Japanese Foreign Ministry 
officials said. 
  The government instructed Japanese embassies in member 
states 
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which 
includes Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore 
and Thailand, to explain that Tokyo's policy is to build 
future-oriented ties, while squarely facing history, said the 
officials. 
  In his messages, Hata referred to his policy speech 
delivered 
in the Diet (parliament) earlier in the day in which he renewed 
the government recognition that Japan's past actions, including 
aggression and colonial rule, inflicted unbearable suffering and 
sorrow on many people. 
  "Communicating this to future generations, the path which 
Japan must take, based on its deep remorse, is to do its utmost 
toward the creation of peace and toward the construction of a 
bright future for the Asia-Pacific region," he said. 
  Nagano, 71, resigned Saturday [7 May] to take responsibility 
for his remarks that the 1937 Nanjing Massacre was a fabrication 
and that Japan was not a nation of aggression during World War 
II.
