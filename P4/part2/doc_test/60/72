  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 8 KYODO -- Japanese Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata Saturday [8 January] told his Chinese counterpart 
Qian Qichen that Japan expects more transparency in Chinese 
military affairs and expects China to play a role in resolving 
the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development, a 
Japanese official said. 
  During two and a half hours of talks, Hata said Japan 
welcomes the recent agreement by the North Koreans to allow some 
inspections, the official said. 
  Qian was quoted as saying China also welcomed the new 
development, adding China expects the problem to be solved 
rapidly in order to keep peace and stability in Northeast Asia, 
he said. 
  Hata, concurrently deputy prime minister, told Qian that 
Japan expects more transparency in China's military development 
and indicated that human rights improvements in China would be 
conducive to better Sino-U.S. relations. 
  The spokesman said Hata, who arrived earlier in the day for 
a 
two-day visit, also took a stand on nuclear weapons 
proliferation and urged China to abide by the Missile Technology 
Control Regime, which aims at preventing proliferation of 
ballistic missile technology. 
  The Chinese side said they would actively participate in a 
total ban on nuclear weapons, a nuclear test ban treaty, the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and would register their 
conventional weapons with the United Nations, he said. 
  Qian, also vice premier, expressed concerns over recent 
relations between Japan and Taiwan. 
  Hata said there would be no change in Japan's policy toward 
Taiwan, and that Japan would continue to abide by the 1972 
Japanese- Chinese Joint Communique in which Japan recognized 
China as sole legitimate government. 
  Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has 
recently sent high-level officials to Taiwan in order to service 
an expected 13 billion dollar trade surplus with the island 
territory in 1993. 
  Qian said Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, known as China's economic 
czar, will visit Japan in February. 
  An invitation was also extended to President Jiang Zemin, 
but 
no date was set, the Japanese official said. 
  Qian strongly requested a visit to China by Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, with the Japanese side expressing hope that a 
visit will be made at an early stage, but no date was fixed, the 
spokesman said. 
  The Japanese side proposed dividing loan periods from five 
years to three-year and two-year periods beginning with the 1996 
fiscal year, with yearly reviews in accordance with the 
principles of the official development assistance, the official 
said. 
  Qian basically accepted the new arrangement, while saying 
China appreciated both Japan's contribution to Chinese economic 
development as well as the new arrangement for the loans. 
  Qian also agreed to yearly reviews of projects involving the 
Japanese loans, the official said. 
  Japan has extended yen-denominated loans to China under 
five- 
and six-year programs since 1979, with 528.2 billion yen loaned 
out in the 1990 to 1995 period covering 42 Chinese projects.
