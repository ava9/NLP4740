  [Text] In an interview with MAINICHI SHIMBUN, Justice 
Minister Shigeto Nagano (a member of the House of Councilors 
from Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]) said: "I believe the 
Nanjing atrocity [Nankin gyakusatsu] is a fabrication." In 
reaction, Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], stated on 4 May: "Nagano's 
remark raises questions about his qualifications as a cabinet 
member. The Hata cabinet should be held responsible for his 
remark. His remark carries a heavy responsibility." Kubo made 
it clear the SDPJ will hold Nagano and the Hata cabinet 
responsible for the controversial remark. With regard to the 
Nanjing atrocity perpetrated by Japanese soldiers during the 
Pacific War, the Tokyo High Court admitted the occurrence of the 
event in its ruling on the Ienaga textbook trial in October 
1993. China is expected to react against, and the Hata cabinet 
will certainly be hard-pressed to deal with, the justice 
minister's controversial remark. 
  Commenting on the MAINICHI SHIMBUN report, Kubo lashed out, 
saying: "There is much evidence that substantiates the Nanjing 
atrocity. Denying the atrocity perpetrated by Japanese soldiers 
is tantamount to denying Japan's war of aggression. His remark 
is based on a wrong position. On what ground did he make it? 
The Hata cabinet should be held responsible for his remark, and 
questions about Nagano's qualifications as a cabinet member 
should be raised." 
  During the interview with MAINICHI SHIMBUN, Justice Minister 
Nagano said: "It is wrong to view the Pacific War as a Japanese 
war of aggression." Kubo took this part of his remarks 
seriously. Noting that former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
definitely stated that "it was a Japanese war of aggression and 
a wrong war," Kubo stressed: "A minister of the Hata government 
that is supposed to have succeeded the Hosokawa government made 
clear his view that flatly denies former Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's view. We have no choice but to think that the 
character of the coalition government has changed."
