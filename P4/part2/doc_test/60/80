  [Text] Miyazaki, June 18 KYODO -- Yohei Kono, president of 
the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), on 
Saturday [18 June] criticized Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's 
remarks that Japan has the capability to produce nuclear weapons. 
  "Such remarks may create misunderstanding in the 
international community," Kono told the party's prefectural 
chapter meeting in Miyazaki, southern Japan. 
  Hata told reporters Friday it is "certainly the case that 
Japan has the capability to possess nuclear weapons but has not 
made them." 
  The prime minister said Japan has abstained from doing so in 
line with its obligations as a nonnuclear power under the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  "How could the prime minister make such comments when every 
nation is making efforts to resolve (the issue of) North korea's 
suspected nuclear weapons development program?" Kono said. 
  He also said A-bomb victims and other concerned people in 
the 
only atomic-bombed nation have a severe perception about nuclear 
weapons. 
  Hata made the comment in connection with a remark he 
reportedly made in a House of Councillors budget committee 
meeting earlier Friday. 
  It is believed to be the first time for the Japanese 
Government to directly acknowledge such potential, either in the 
Diet or publicly.
