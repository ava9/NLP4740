<P>
Entertainer Bobby Berosini was awarded $4.2 million by a jury Saturday in his 
bitter yearlong battle with animal rights activists who accused him of beating 
orangutans used in his act on the Las Vegas Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you, America," Berosini, a native of Czechoslovakia, said as he left the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll never see a penny of that money," responded Philip Hirschkop, an 
attorney for the Washington-based People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals 
(PETA). Hirschkop said he would appeal the award that a state District Court 
jury handed down after three days of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
The animal rights organization was assessed $2 million in damages on counts of 
invasion of privacy and defamation. Jeanne Roush, an investigator for the 
group, and Ottavio Gesmundo, a former employee at the Stardust Hotel, where 
Berosini performed, were each assessed $1 million in damages on the same 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
A California nonprofit organization, Performing Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), 
and its executive director, Pat Derby, were each assessed $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
But the jury found no malice in the actions of the defendants and issued 
verdicts precluding Berosini from collecting punitive damages. Hirschkop said 
that because the jury found defamation and invasion of privacy but no malice, 
the verdict was inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
Gesmundo videotaped scenes of Berosini striking his orangutans before they went 
on stage for performances at the Stardust Hotel in July, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The videotapes were then circulated to animal rights groups, including PETA and 
PAWS. Representatives of those two groups took the tapes to local and national 
media, including "Entertainment Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Berosini claimed the adverse publicity damaged his career and cost him millions 
of dollars in bookings. On the witness stand, he portrayed the orangutans, 
which he calls "his kids," as powerful animals that must be disciplined if they 
are to be kept under control. Berosini also said the primates were spooked by 
dancers in the show who made animal noises in an effort to get them to 
misbehave. 
</P>
<P>
Animal rights activists descended on Las Vegas, picketing in front of the 
Stardust and encouraging the public to pass up the show. 
</P>
<P>
He continues to headline at the Stardust and hurried from the courthouse 
Saturday, saying, "I've got to go take care of the kids. We've got to perform 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
"I was used as a pawn to make money," Berosini said of attacks by the animal 
rights groups. "They were using this as a means of fund-raising." 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments Wednesday, an attorney for Berosini urged jurors to send a 
message to the animal rights movement. Attorney Tom Pitaro called on jurors to 
stop animal activists who oppose everything "from circuses to medical research 
to save babies." 
</P>
<P>
But after the verdicts came in, the national director of People for the Ethical 
Treatment of Animals said her group will continue its fight. "It is the duty, 
and the First Amendment right, of every animal protection organization to speak 
out against cruelty," Ingrid Newkirk said. 
</P>
<P>
"Lawsuits designed to stop people from protecting animals -- and for that 
matter, children, senior citizens or anyone subject to abuse -- cannot be 
allowed to ultimately prevail."
