OVERCOMING THE STRING SHORTAGE

The evolution of string groups in jazz has been a checkered story. The trouble 
usually is that you can lead a fiddle to the jazz group, but you can't make it 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the occasional violin soloist (Joe Venuti, Stuff Smith, Stephane 
Grappelli and a dozen others), string players (except, of course, those who 
played string bass primarily in its rhythm function) have shown themselves 
largely incapable of capturing the improvisational essence common to the great 
horn artists. 
</P>
<P>
During the past few years several promising steps have been taken to correct 
the problem. The albums reviewed below are significant cases in point. 
</P>
<P>
UPTOWN STRING QUARTET: Philips 838-358-2. **** 
</P>
<P>
An offshoot of Max Roach's Double Quartet, this group includes his daughter, 
Maxine Roach, on viola. She and the two violinists and cellist clearly have the 
qualifications to establish a jazz feeling when it is required. Working without 
a rhythm section, the foursome glides rather than swings, with an 
unconventional repertoire that includes "Jelly Roll Rag" and "Easy Winner," 
both achieving a quaint turn of the century flavor; arrangements by Bill Lee 
(Spike's father) of traditional African-American songs, and originals by Max 
Roach (arranged by Maxine) and Oscar Pettiford among others. Though the 
emphasis is on well phrased ensemble playing, there are enough solo touches to 
establish each members' individual credentials.

WARREN VACHE AND THE BEAUXARTS STRING QUARTET: "Warm Evenings" Concorde Jazz 
CCD 4392 *** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
There is no attempt to use this quartet for purposes other than elaborate 
window dressing for a superior soloist, but this tradition goes all the way 
back to Charlie Parker with strings. The charts by Jack Gale support Vache's 
coronet in a set of standards, but the third and fourth cuts are mood-breakers 
in which he has only a rhythm section for backing. Vache has the right lyrical 
touch for Gordon Jenkins' "This Is All I Ask," in which the strings help him 
sublimate an already superior melody.

JOHN HANDY WITH CLASS: "Centerpiece" Milestone MCD 9173-2. *** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
Handy's alto saxophone blends beautifully with three versatile colleagues: 
Julie Carter, Tarika Lewis, Sandi Poindexter. All three play the violin, sing, 
hum and scat -- on two cuts they even play and sing simultaneously, without 
overdubbing. Handy and another male singer joined the vocal proceedings here 
and there, but primarily this adventurous unit wins points, despite occasional 
intonation lapses, for the ingenious blending (in Handy's own arrangements) of 
his horn with voices and/or violins. Four of the eight tunes are based on the 
blues.

<P>
DIZZY GILLESPIE: "The Symphony Sessions" ProJazz CDJ698 *** 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's regular quintet is surrounded by the Rochester Philharmonic, with 
John Dankworth conducting. The seven pieces are compositions he wrote 20 to 46 
years ago, some recorded in earlier versions that left no room for improvement. 
Nevertheless, Robert Farnon's arrangement of "Con Alma" and Mike Crotty's 
interesting treatment of "Fiesta Mojo" (with logical use of the strings) rise 
above the general level, as does the long, quasi-symphonic treatment by J.J. 
Johnson of "Night in Tunisia," composed in 1943. Gillespie's horn, though not 
always in optimum form, does eloquent justice to "Brother K.," his lyrical 
tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King. There is generally good solo work by Ron 
Holloway on tenor sax and the somewhat poorly recorded guitar of Ed Cherry.

ART PEPPER: "The Complete Galaxy Recordings" Galaxy GCD-1016-2. ***** 
</P>
<P>
Strings play a minor role here, but on one of the 11 sessions Pepper was backed 
by a violins-and-celli ensemble for eight songs (five of which are heard 
additionally in alternate takes). Bill Holman and Jimmy Bond each wrote four of 
the arrangements, providing for Pepper what was clearly an inspiring harmonic 
cushion. On one of the Holman charts, "Blues in the Night," Pepper switched 
from alto saxophone to clarinet. The rest of this 16-CD set, selling for a mere 
$225, consists of Pepper's combo dates from 1978 through April 1982, seven 
weeks before his death. His choice of sidemen, and of songs, was impeccable. 
The pianists were George Cables, Stanley Cowell, Hank Jones and Tommy Flanagan. 
It would be hard to ask for anything more.
