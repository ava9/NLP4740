*** 1/2 ED BICKERT &amp; LORNE LOFSKY "THIS IS NEW" CONCORD JAZZ

Two prominent Toronto guitarists -- Bickert, 57, and Lofsky, 36 -- join with 
two of Canada's best rhythm purveyors, bassist Neal Swainson and drummer Jerry 
Fuller, for a low-key collaboration on tunes mainly written by fellow jazzmen 
(Wes Montgomery, Cedar Walton, Horace Silver, Steve Swallow). Each has a solo 
track; Lofsky's harmonic grace is well displayed in the Ellington-Strayhorn 
"Star Crossed Lovers." Both men deal ingeniously with Charlie Parker's 
contrapuntal theme "Ah Leu Cha." A superior sampling of north-of-the-border 
jazz.

*** CLEVELAND WATKISS "Green Chimneys" Verve 
</P>
<P>
 Is Watkiss Britain's answer to Bobby McFerrin? The evidence is mixed. His 
self-overdubbed ensembles come off well; as a group he's impressive, but as a 
scat soloist he is derivative, as are some of his quasi-Hendricks lyrics. He is 
backed by some of England's best young (and mainly black) jazzmen; Courtney 
Pine and Steve Williamson play saxes on three tunes. The various rhythm 
sections try their best to swing, succeeding at times. Watkiss has potential; 
give him a chance -- this is his first outing.

*** JACK TEAGARDEN "That's a Serious Thing" RCA Bluebird 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt about it, Teagarden (1905-64) was the definitive trombone of his day 
and a splendid, Texas-twanged singer. Sadly, he was hampered too often by inept 
colleagues (the abysmal saxophonist Mezz Mezzrow), stupid songs ("I'se a 
Muggin' ") and pompous pseudo-jazz or dance bands (Paul Whiteman, Roger Wolfe 
Kahn). Of the 21 cuts, only the last eight -- made between 1938 and 1947 -- do 
him justice without unhappy trappings: an all-star date, a session of his own, 
and two tracks with Louis Armstrong, followed by a fine Bud Freeman clambake. 
But even some of the weakest items have valuable moments by Joe Venuti, Fats 
Waller, Benny Goodman et al.

** 1/2 MARLON JORDON "For You Only" Columbia 
</P>
<P>
Branford Marsalis helps to shore up the debut of a very young trumpeter in an 
egregious example of oversell and overkill. To credit this youth with "a 
heart-racing hymn to the fearless warriors of this Native American music" (just 
for playing "Cherokee" in eighth notes) and with "a swirling vortex of 
idealism, passion, and hard swing" is embarrassing. (Did a relative write these 
notes?) Sure, he's very promising indeed, and he is in high-powered company; 
but the first four minutes of "Stardust," in which he plods through the verse 
and chorus dead straight, are boredom incarnate. Still, Jordon has plenty of 
time to mature -- he's only 18. LEONARD FEATHER
