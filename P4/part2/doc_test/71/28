  [Text] Afghanistan welcomes all efforts to bring about a 
permanent peace. Dr. Najibollah Lefrai, state minister in 
foreign affairs, told a Bakhtar Information Agency that an 
Afghan special envoy, who has recently gone to Pakistan, has 
delivered a message from the Afghan president to Pakistan's 
president at a meeting. They talked about a permanent peace and 
explained our principled stand. 
  Dr. Lefrai said the position taken by Afghanistan has not 
changed. The conspirators should surrender their heavy weapons. 
The Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] lead by 
Golboddin Hekmatyar should give guarantees of no more war 
against the state.
