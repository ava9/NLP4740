  [Summary from poor reception] While attacking diplomatic 
quarters in Kabul city today the Dostam-Karmal-Golboddin militia 
fired rockets at the embassies of the Federal Republic of 
Germany and Libya. A spokesman of the Kabul garrison command 
told a BIA correspondent that the militiamen, who have no 
principles or Islamic standards, fired rockets today against 
Kabul, resulting in one of our innocent compatriots being 
martyred and 12 others injured. A number of houses were 
demolished.
