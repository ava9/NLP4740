  [Text] The Golboddin-Dostam militia once again embarked on 
aggression against the Islamic army's positions and put the 
residential regions of Kabul city under a rain of rocket and 
mortar fire. The military correspondent of the BAKHTAR 
INFORMATION AGENCY reports that the criminal Golboddin-Dostam 
militia, following yesterday's failed attack -- launching 
rockets and firing heavy weapons -- last night also launched 
hundreds of rockets from the type of SAKAR, BM-12, BM-21, and 
mortar mine on residential regions of Kabul city. As a result 
of the launched rockets, which mostly landed on the residential 
regions of the 11th, 10th, fourth and second wards of the city, 
a number of our compatriots were martyred and a number were 
seriously injured. As a result of this lunatic action of 
Hekmatyar, in addition to loss of life, a number of residential 
houses, and government buildings located in the above wards were 
either destroyed or damaged. One mosque located in Khairkhana 
III was demolished. 
  The report adds that the infamous Golboddin-Dostam militia 
last night embarked on infantry aggression against the positions 
of the Islamic state's forces from the direction of Bala Hesar. 
It was foiled in the same way as their other unsuccessful 
attacks. With the blessing of Almighty God, courageous 
resistance by the mojahedin and soldiers of the Islamic army, 
the enemy was forced to retreat. A responsible security source 
put the enemy losses at 20 dead and 10 injured. 
  Military observers believe the recent actions by the 
Golboddin-Dostam mercenary militiamen in Kabul are an effort to 
recompense and disguise the repeated defeats of militia in the 
north and to disrupt the peace process in the country. The 
murderer and adventurist militiamen of Golboddin-Dostam can only 
see their political-military survival in fighting and in 
continuation of tension. This claim can be entirely 
substantiated by Golboddin Hekmatyar's (?utterance) made 
yesterday at a meeting with the peace delegation consisting of 
ulema from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and some Jehadi 
leaders and personalities of Afghanistan. In reply to a 
question by a peace-seeking ulema who asked Hekmatyar to 
refrain, for the sake of holy Koran, from further bloodshed, 
destruction, and further defaming of Jehad and Islam, and asked 
him to open supply routes for the Muslim and innocent people of 
Kabul and to stop firing blind rockets, Hekmatyar with anger and 
disrespect said: I will fight for another 25 years against the 
Islamic sovereignty and people. And I would not reverse until I 
gain power. 
  This is happening at a time when esteemed professor 
Borhanoddin Rabbani, president of the Islamic State of 
Afghanistan, despite unforgivable crimes committed by Golboddin, 
has displayed flexibility and [words indistinct] in honor of the 
peace delegation from the fraternal countries of Saudi, 
Pakistan, and Bangladesh, as well as Jehadi leaders and 
personalities of Afghanistan. Relying on the usual strategy of 
the Islamic state, which is resolving the country's issues by 
talks and understanding, Rabbani declared a unilateral 
cease-fire in Kabul. But the Golboddin-Dostam militia, ignoring 
the cease-fire, have been attacking the positions of the Islamic 
army and residential regions during the past two days with heavy 
weapons and infantry forces. The Islamic state's forces 
responded to these attacks by defending their positions and 
safeguarding the life and property of the civil population in 
Kabul city.
