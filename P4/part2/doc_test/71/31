  [Text] On the fifth anniversary of the escape of the 
occupying Soviet forces from Afghanistan, events in the country 
are moving in two different ways. The Islamic State of 
Afghanistan, as the center of the gathering of real mojahedin, 
is defending the results of the jihad. And the mojahedin 
continue to sacrifice themselves in continuing their holy jihad 
to eliminate the last remnants of the foreigners' hirelings like 
the infamous Karmal-Dostam group. But Golboddin Hekmatyar, the 
known wheeler-dealer of the period of jihad, has, in alliance 
with Parcham and Khalq, the two factions of the Communist Party, 
started a rebellion against the mojahedin of Afghanistan and the 
Islamic State. Golboddin, on the one hand by his coalition with 
the so-called National Movement, which is headed by 
nation-seller Karmal, has embarked on the killing of the people 
of Kabul. On the other hand with the atheist Tanay [exiled 
former defense minister under Najibollah] he gathered around him 
the band of Khalqis and instructed him to embark on the 
establishment of the so-called peace movement outside 
Afghanistan. 
  It is not without a reason that at the time of the attack by 
Karmal-Golboddin-Dostam and on the occasion of the fifth 
anniversary of the escape of the Soviet forces from Afghanistan, 
once again the communist Shahnawaz Tanay raises his voice, and 
in cooperation with Golboddin he expresses his opposition to all 
jihadi leaders and Afghan mojahedin. This shows that to reach 
his sinister goals, Golboddin is serving as an instrument for 
the reunion of Khalqis and Parchamis. But for the mojahedin the 
fifth anniversary of the escape of the Soviet occupier from 
Afghanistan serves as a strong motive for the consolidation of 
the jihad's trenches against the defeated communists of Khalq 
and Parcham and their ill-nature. The heroic affirmative 
response of all jihadi organizations to the holy jihad against 
the Karmal-Dostam militia reflects this fact. The situation of 
the country and the coordination of the jihadi organizations to 
crush the Karmal-Dostum militia show that the mojahed Afghan 
nation is determined to completely eliminate from the Islamic 
State the twin movements of Tanay and Dostam on the sixth 
anniversary of the escape of the Soviet forces. And Golboddin 
who against the wishes of all mojahedin of the Hezb-e Eslami 
[Islamic Party] has formed an unholy alliance with them will not 
have a better fate than them.
