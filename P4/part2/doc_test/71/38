  [Text] According to a report, the Golboddin-Dostam militia 
resorted to a failed attack on the positions of the Islamic Army 
from the direction of Kata-e Naw. They were forced to retreat 
after leaving 20 dead. 
  Sources in the Armed Forces report that Golboddin's 
headquarters in Charasiab was seriously damaged during air 
attacks by the Islamic state's jets. 
  According to another report, at around 0900 hours on 27 June 
an aircraft belonging to Dostam's militia appeared over Kabul 
and targeted the residential areas of Shar-e Naw and Shirpour 
with two bombs. As a result of this savage attack, seven Kabul 
city civilians were killed, 12 others were injured, and three 
houses were destroyed.
