  [Text] Havana, 28 May (PL) -- Cali and Santa Clara, 
important cities in Colombia and Cuba, signed a protocol to make 
them sister cities as a contribution to the intensification of 
the bilateral cooperation that is taking place between both 
countries. 
  The information was revealed today during a modest ceremony 
to bid farewell to the Cuban delegation that will leave for 
Colombia tomorrow to implement the agreement to link the capital 
of Valle del Cauca Department and the city located in the 
central part of the island. 
  The Cubans will also participate in the sessions of the 
world 
meeting of mayors of healthy cities convened by Colombia, which 
will be attended by some 100 mayors from various countries of 
the world between 1 and 4 June. 
  The purpose of the meeting will be to exchange experiences 
regarding primary health care. The invitation sent to Cuba is 
based on the progress attained by the country in that field. 
  The Cuban delegation includes Humberto Rodriguez Gonzalez, 
president of the People's Government (mayor) of Santa Clara, and 
Jose Luis Garcia, rector of the Central University of Las 
Villas, both deputies and members of the Central Committee of 
the Cuban Communist Party (PCC). Another member of the 
delegation traveling to Cali is Marcelino Rodriguez Tejeda, 
director of the important mechanical industry plant in Santa 
Clara and also a member of the PCC Central Committee. 
  Colombian ambassador to Cuba, Ricardo Santamaria, who was 
present at the ceremony, said the movement to twin the cities of 
both countries will contribute to the intensification of 
bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, economy, and 
culture. 
  Santamaria said one of the fundamental objectives is the 
mutual learning of the productive, cultural, and social 
activities of both cities. He added that, later on, a Cali 
delegation will visit Santa Clara, which will facilitate the 
identification of areas of cooperation. 
  Through this symbolism of city twinning, there are great 
efforts made to strengthen bilateral relations because the 
future visits of Cali officials to Cuba will include a 
delegation of businessmen interested in specific projects. 
  The diplomat also talked about the important increase in the 
balance of trade between the two countries during the last four 
months as recognized in the latest report by the Colombian 
foreign trade authorities. He also recognized the work done by 
Jesus Martinez Beato, the Cuban ambassador in Santa Fe de Bogota. 
  Moreover, Rodriguez Gonzalez said this direct exchange will 
facilitate the strengthening of the Latin American integration 
movement. He mentioned the bilateral cooperation possibilities 
to which the industrial potential that exists in Santa Clara can 
also contribute. 
  University rector Garcia Cuevas talked about the recognized 
level of the institutions of higher learning in Valle del Cauca 
Department and predicted the achievement of a higher qualitative 
level in the exchanges that have already taken place with El 
Valle University and other institutions. 
  The movement to twin the cities of Cuba and Colombia began 
with the twinning of Santiago de Cuba and Cartagena. It will 
continue with the one between Cali and Santa Clara, and there 
are plans to continue with the twinning of Barranquilla and 
Matanzas. 
  Likewise there is an interest in twinning Cienfuegos and 
Medellin, Varadero and Santa Marta, the island of San Andres 
with the western Isle of Youth in Cuba.
