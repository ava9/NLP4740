  [Text] Caracas, 21 Jan (PL) -- Following a discussion with 
President-elect Rafael Caldera, Gonzalo Garcia Bustillos, the 
Venezuelan ambassador in Cuba, today stressed that relations 
between Caracas and Havana are excellent and friendly. 
  In statement to journalists, Garcia Bustillos said president 
Caldera's Government is willing to maintain friendly relations 
with Cuba. 
  Garcia Bustillos also expressed his rejection of the 
economic 
blockade the United States has maintained against Cuba for three 
decades, and he said measures of this sort should not be 
implemented at this time. 
  Garcia Bustillos recalled that President-elect Caldera views 
the theory of social justice as the basis for international 
relations, and he said this theory should go into effect in 
today's international community. 
  Garcia Bustillos favored Cuba's reintegration into the OAS 
as 
part of the family comprising all of the states in the 
continent, and discussed the situation and the recent economic 
measures implemented in Cuba. 
  Garcia Bustillos said he met with President-elect Caldera to 
exchange general views regarding foreign policy.
