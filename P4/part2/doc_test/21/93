  [Text] The arrest of two suspects in a plot against the 
Honduran president, the arrest of Commander Saul Alvarez' 
murderer in Miami, and the drug problem in the country were 
topics addressed by Commander Fernando Caldera, director of the 
National Police. Police arrested two individuals suspected of 
participating in the plot to assassinate Honduran President 
Carlos Roberto Reina. Santiago Rivas Betancourt was arrested in 
Esteli on 5 April, and Luis Rene Quintero was arrested in 
Managua on 6 April. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] Because it is a sign of a serious 
act, we are proceeding to arrest them. The law empowers us to 
hold them for 72 hours; during that time, we are going to try to 
determine the facts. [end recording] 
  Another Nicaraguan suspect in the case, which was made 
public 
in Honduras on 5 April, remains at large. Honduran authorities 
have identified him as Roger Arguello. Caldera made these 
statements when he announced Commander Saul Alvarez' murderer 
was arrested in Miami last week. Javier or Manuel Velasquez 
murdered Commander Alvarez on 21 September 1992 during a 
transportation strike. The murderer illegally entered the United 
States by going from Managua to Guatemala and Mexico, then to 
the United States. The police worked in coordination with the 
FBI and Dade County police to capture Velasquez. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] He is now under the jurisdiction 
of 
immigration authorities. The Nicaraguan Government -- it is no 
longer up to the police -- will make every effort to bring him 
to Nicaragua so he can be tried in Managua. [end recording] 
  Velasquez left the country 10 days after the shoot-out on 
the 
northern highway. 
  On another topic, Commander Caldera said he is unaware of 
the 
State Department report which indicated Nicaragua has reportedly 
not achieved progress with its strategy against drug trafficking. 
  [Being Caldera recording] The Nicaraguan state has been 
advancing in the antidrug struggle starting from zero. Drug 
trafficking in Nicaragua is a relatively new crime. [end 
recording] 
  He described the draft law against drugs as a modern law 
that 
will fight crime.
