  [Text] Colombia is not a corrupt country and its 
presidential candidates do not have links to the mafia, the 
Colombian Government and political circles said when they 
rejected charges in this regard by the U.S. Congress. 
  In general terms we are a clean country and that is why we 
reject such slander, Colombian Ambassador in Washington Gabriel 
Silva said. We will not remain indifferent nor will we allow 
these charges to prosper. Many innocent persons have died and 
we are not going to trample on their memories, he said. 
  The government expressed its concern and disagreement with 
the accusation that the entire country is corrupt and that the 
presidential candidates receive support from the mafia. 
According to the U.S. Congress, this accusation is based on 
confessions by former Medellin Cartel member Gabriel Taboada. 
  The ambassador described those hearings and the statements 
by 
the drug trafficker -- who is a witness for Senator Kerry -- as 
inadmissible. He also lamented that all of this has weakened 
the war on drugs. Ambassador Silva said the accusations by this 
convict are an affront to the families of thousands of brave 
Colombians who have lost their lives in this war on the mafias. 
He said the mere use of Taboada is a clear sign of how 
Congress' watchdog function has been sidetracked, something that 
will affect our capacity to learn about the reality of the war 
on drugs. Apparently the only firsthand information this drug 
trafficker has goes back to the mid-1980's, but he was 
nevertheless allowed to question the integrity of an entire 
country, which is known in the whole world as a leader in the 
struggle against drugs, Ambassador Gabriel Silva said.
