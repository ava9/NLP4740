  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 20 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The United States 
will support Honduras in its aspirations to join the UN Security 
Council, the Foreign Relations Ministry reported today. 
  In a communique, the Honduran Foreign Ministry announced 
U.S. 
Ambassador to Tegucigalpa William Pryce expressed Washington's 
support for Honduras. The United States "has the pleasure to 
support Honduras' candidacy and hopes to work with its 
representative at the Security Council that will be installed in 
1995," the U.S. envoy said, according to the text of the 
communique. Pryce remarked it will be "a pleasure and honor to 
give them our support," while Honduran Foreign Minister Ernesto 
Paz Aguilar explained that the White House decision is valued 
"highly," according to the document. 
  U.S. support of this nation's hopes to become a nonpermanent 
member of the Security Council "represents a good piece of news, 
a specific demonstration of the excellent relations between 
Honduras and the United States," Paz Aguilar emphasized. 
  Honduras has become the sole candidate of the group of 
nations from Latin America and the Caribbean for the election 
that will take place during the 49th session of the UN General 
Assembly, scheduled for next autumn. 
  The UN Security Council has five permanent members -- China, 
the United States, France, Great Britain, and Russia -- and 10 
nonpermanent members, whose membership changes every two years.
