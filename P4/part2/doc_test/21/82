  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports from regional sources on reaction from various Latin 
American officials and politicians to the 27 March election of 
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo as OAS secretary 
general. 
<H5>  Colombia </H5>
  Several Colombian presidential candidates have commented on 
President Cesar Gaviria's election to the post of OAS secretary 
general. AD/M-19 (19 April Movement Democratic Alliance) 
presidential candidate Antonio Navarro Wolff said he hopes 
Gaviria will act "independently and will actually serve as an 
OAS secretary instead of U.S. State Department secretary." 
Meanwhile, presidential candidate Enrique Parejo noted that the 
president's responsibility as head of the nation's foreign 
policy was inconsistent with his role of promoting his own 
candidacy as OAS secretary general. Presidential hopeful Miguel 
Maza Marquez congratulated Gaviria on his election victory, but 
he warned that regional "pro-integration policy" could be 
adveresly affected by Gaviria's election. (Santa Fe de Bogota 
Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 1800 GMT 27 Mar 94) 
  Ernesto Samper, Liberal Party presidential candidate, today 
said in Santa Fe de Bogota that the OAS member-states' support 
for President Gaviria could help rid Colombia of an image 
tainted by violence and drug trafficking. Samper explained: 
"With this election, the countries have recognized Colombia's 
ability to lead on a hemispheric level." Samper noted Gaviria 
"will do an excellent job to strengthen the OAS." Meanwhile, 
Conservative Party Presidential Candidate Andres Pastrana Arango 
said the results of the OAS election represent "a recognition of 
Colombia's value within regional political processes." (Mexico

<H5>  El Salvador </H5>
  Salvadoran leftist and rightist groups today called the 
election of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria as OAS secretary 
general "positive." Joaquin Villalobos, one of the main leaders 
of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), said 
the election of the Colombian president "is a positive sign." 
He said Gaviria's election "established the need for Central 
America to continue moving down the path of intergration to 
defend its interests as a united region." Meanwhile, ARENA 
(National Republican Alliance) Deputy Rene Figueroa told NOTIMEX 
that Gaviria's election will bring "new brilliance and dynamism 
to the OAS." He predicted that, under a Gaviria administration, 
relations with the United States will be more cordial. (Mexico 
City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2237 GMT 27 Mar 94) 
<H5>  Guatemala </H5>
  Jose Luis Chea, secretary general of Guatemala's Democratic 
Union, today said the election of Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria as OAS secretary general demonstrates that large 
countries, such as the United States, continue to impose their 
will on the OAS. Chea, former president of the Group of 77, 
told ACAN-EFE that Gaviria's election demonstrates that "only 
large countries are permitted to hold the post of OAS secretary 
general." He concluded by saying the election only proves the 
United States is maintaining its influence over the OAS.

<H5>  Nicaragua </H5>
  Nicaraguan Deputy Foreign Minister Jose Pallais said Central 
America has once again had its hopes of guiding the OAS dashed. 
He said, "We are very pleased with the outcome, although 
Central America will continue to aspire to this post, despite 
the fact that this end could not be accomplished at this time." 
Meanwhile, Sandinist Carlos Tunnermann, Nicaragua's former 
ambassador to the OAS, told ACAN-EFE that Cesar Gaviria "will 
inject" dynamism, prestige, and experience into the OAS. 
Commenting on the defeat of Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd 
Niehaus, Tunnerman said, "the time will come" when Central 
America "will have a candidate that will receive the support" of 
the other countries in the hemisphere. (Panama City ACAN in 
Spanish 1855 GMT 27 Mar 94) 
<H5>  Central America </H5>
  Commenting on the election of Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria as OAS secretary general, Danilo Roca, member of the 
Political Commission of the Central American Parliament, has 
declared that the United States supported Gaviria to pay him 
back for killing Pablo Escobar and waging a successful war on 
drugs. Roca also contended that Costa Rican Foreign Minister 
Bernd Niehaus' defeat resulted from Costa Rica wavering in its 
integrationist policy. Meanwhile, the Labor and Popular Action 
Union of Guatemala called on the OAS to become a mechanism that 
will contribute to creating a new international community based 
on peace, solidarity, and development. Former Guatemalan 
President Vinicio Cerezo expressed his "satisfaction" with 
Gaviria's election. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2250 GMT 27
