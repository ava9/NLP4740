  [Text] Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter yesterday 
confirmed U.S. President Bill Clinton's plans to nominate Robert 
Pastor as the new U.S. ambassador to Panama. Carter said that 
he had met with President Clinton last week and that the 
President told him that he plans to nominate, to the Panamanian 
Government and the U.S. Senate, Pastor as the new U.S. 
ambassador to Panama. 
  Civilist sectors in Panama are against Pastor's appointment 
as the new ambassador. They claim the statesman associated with 
the U.S. Democratic Party maintained close ties with the former 
Panamanian military regime that was overthrown by the U.S. 
invasion on 20 December 1989. 
  Carter added that when he met with President Guillermo 
Endara 
last week Endara said he was pleased by Pastor's nomination. 
  If President Clinton's proposal is confirmed, Pastor will 
occupy the post of U.S. ambassador in Panama left vacant by 
former Ambassador Deane Hinton in February.
