SOVIET EMPIRE: THERE IS A SOLUTION FOR THE INEVITABLE LOSS OF THE NON-RUSSIAN 
REPUBLICS: CREATE A COMMONWEALTH, ON THE BRITISH MODEL.

Liquidation of an empire is never a pleasant process, least of all for the 
emperor. Dissolution of a federal union is equally difficult. Nevertheless, 
those are the tasks that face Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Some American commentators have drawn analogies to Abraham Lincoln and the 
secession movement that led to the Civil War, but the situations are not 
parallel. The Soviet Union is not a historically unified nation; neither is it 
composed of constituent parts that voluntarily accepted central leadership. 
Today's Soviet state is composed of Slavic Great Russia, two additional Slavic 
"republics" and a cobbled-together assortment of provinces largely inhabited by 
non-Russian, non-Slavic, and in many cases, nonwhite and non-Christian, 
peoples. Nearly all of the Soviet republics in which nationalism now threatens 
adhesion to Moscow were once sovereign states. In most of them, Russian is 
still a foreign tongue. 
</P>
<P>
There is no good reason to cast Gorbachev in the role of Lincoln. Preservation 
of the Great Russian Empire, handed down from the czars to the commissars, need 
not be central to his goals and strategy. Indeed, unless the Russian officers 
of the Soviet Army are capable of ordering the same lethal force against 
citizens of the Baltic republics, Georgia and the Ukraine as they did against 
Muslim Azerbaijanis and Christian Armenians, and unless Russian soldiers will 
shoot their Slavic kin, it is unlikely that the empire can be preserved in its 
present form. There are, however, two ways to lose an empire. 
</P>
<P>
After World War II, the French fought a bloody but futile campaign to hang on 
to their holdings in Indochina and North Africa, at an enormous cost in money, 
lives and international standing. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the British looked at the map, at the resources available to 
sustain an imperial renaissance and at their probable lack of success. 
Pretending that Britain made no attempts to postpone the inevitable would be 
unfair to those who fought to liberate their nations. Nevertheless, from the 
emancipation of India and Pakistan onward, the world witnessed a series of 
midnight ceremonies in which the Union Jack was slowly lowered and given into 
the hands of a representative of the royal family and the flag of a new nation 
snappily unfurled in the spotlight. In place of a global empire, Great Britain 
engineered a successful but loose commonwealth based on commercial ties and a 
certain amount of nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
This is an option worth President Gorbachev's careful attention. A Soviet 
commonwealth could incorporate a free trade area, perhaps including Estonia, 
Latvia and Lithuania and extending to the Muslim crescent on the Asian border. 
While members of the Soviet commonwealth would be independent and sovereign, 
they might adopt a convertible ruble as a common currency. Most members of the 
British Commonwealth acknowledge the Queen as their own head of state; that is 
unlikely to work for a Soviet commonwealth, but neither has it proved necessary 
in the British one. Nations of the British Commonwealth do not share a common 
policy toward the rest of the world, but they do meet annually to discuss their 
differences with civility; a Soviet commonwealth could function similarly. 
</P>
<P>
There is little alternative: In the shortest of terms -- the end of 1990, or 
the end of next week -- the network of buffer states known as the Warsaw Pact 
will cease to function. The two Germanys will merge; Hungary, Poland and 
Czechoslovakia will all have non-socialist governments inclined to look 
westward for industrial markets and supplies, and perhaps eastward to sell 
agricultural products. In the only slightly longer term, the Baltic republics 
will cease to function as provinces of the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, all three 
will keep their historic and commercial ties to Russia, and Lithuania was a 
Russian province for more than five centuries before achieving independence 
after World War I. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the decade, the centrifugal force of nationalism will likely rip 
Transcaucasia -- Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia -- from the Russian empire. A 
commonwealth should benefit the new states and the old empire. It is difficult, 
however, to envision these regions being economically self-sufficient, except 
at the level of 18th-Century agriculture and 19th-Century industry. Their 
natural markets and natural sources of raw materials are clearly in Russia, not 
in the West. 
</P>
<P>
More important to the survival of Russia (as opposed to the Soviet Union) is a 
continuing association with the Ukraine, which provides about half of the 
Soviet grain harvest, with Georgia and its mineral wealth and warmer-weather 
agriculture and with Slavic Byelorussia. Unfortunately for 
Gorbachev-as-Lincoln, the forces pulling these three republics away from Moscow 
are rooted in language, history and religion, emotional forces far stronger 
than the need for a joint economy. Barring civil war, the Slavic parts of 
today's Soviet Union are likely to spin apart someday. The less tangible but 
more profitable ties of a commonwealth are, however, apt to prove more enduring 
than bonds imposed by force. Choosing commonwealth instead of union may be 
Gorbachev's last option.
