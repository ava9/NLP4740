OBSERVATIONS ON 'THE CIVIL WAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bernstein's article indicated that the miniseries lessened some people's 
opinion of Lincoln vis-a-vis slavery. I was saddened to hear this. 
</P>
<P>
In 1854, Lincoln largely abandoned a prosperous law practice and -- at much 
financial and personal loss -- spent 10 years doing everything practical and 
possible on behalf of the slaves. 
</P>
<P>
He stopped working only when all slaves were liberated by constitutional 
amendment, actual ratification of the amendment occurring toward the end of the 
year in which he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln has been criticized for not working sooner to free the slaves in the 
Old South. Had he done so, he would not have been elected President and the 
slaves would have remained in bondage for God knows how many decades. Had he 
taken a stronger anti-slavery position sooner, he would have been just one more 
ineffective abolitionist. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln accomplished the miracle of the freeing all slaves and saving the 
Union. No person ever accomplished so much.
