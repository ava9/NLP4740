Recently, as I drove past my old Lincoln Savings branch, my mind wandered back 
to the days when I enjoyed just stopping by to view Abraham Lincoln relics on 
display in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, it gave me a feeling of confidence to know that my savings were in the 
hands of those who revered the principles of honest dealings so closely 
identified with Honest Abe. 
</P>
<P>
Now the place looks shabby and my vision of the care-worn face of Lincoln faded 
for a moment only to be replaced by the figures of Keating and Cranston. Of 
such experiences cynics are created and innocence is lost.
