The Mexican lawmaker implicated in last week's assassination of Mr Jose
Francisco Ruiz Massieu agreed yesterday to renounce his congressional
immunity, and turn himself over to the authorities.
Congress yesterday afternoon voted to grant Mr Manuel Munoz Rocha's request
for leave. A spokesman for the attorney-general's office said Mr Munoz
Rocha's whereabouts were known, and unconfirmed reports indicated that he
had been detained.
Mr Munoz Rocha said in a statement released by Congress that he had proof
that Mr Abraham Rubio Canales, a former close associate of Mr Ruiz Massieu
serving time in jail for fraud, was the 'intellectual author' of the
assassination. Mr Rubio Canales reportedly bore a grudge against Mr Ruiz
Massieu, who he believed could have kept him out of prison.
Separately, the wife of one of the alleged accomplices told investigators
that Mr Munoz Rocha had been paid about Dollars 300,000 by Mr Rubio Canales
to plan the assassination. She alleged that the conspirators' next target
had been the governor of the state of Tamaulipas whom Mr Munoz Rocha wished
to succeed.
Reports of a conspiracy to assassinate Mr Ruiz Massieu continued to rattle
investors in Mexico's financial markets. Yesterday interest rates on all but
the shortest-term government paper rose sharply in the weekly auction. The
stock market was down 1 per cent at the close, having recovered the sharp
losses of the morning.
The conspiracy theories were given further life yesterday by Mr Munoz
Rocha's claim, reported in a newspaper, that Mexico's legendary former oil
union boss, Mr Joaqun Hernandez Galicia, known as 'La Quina', was involved
in the assassination of Mr Ruiz Massieu, the number two official in Mexico's
ruling party. La Quina controlled Mexico's powerful oil union until 1989,
when his arrest was ordered by President Carlos Salinas.
In a further move last night, the attorney-general's office said that Mr
Humberto Garcia Abrego, brother of Mr Juan Garcia Abrego, suspected leader
of the Gulf drug cartel, had been detained. He was being questioned about
thee cartel's possible involvement in the murder.
