<P>
Just one day after its parent company filed for bankruptcy, federal regulators 
seized Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. today because it had 
"dissipated its assets through violations of regulations and laws." 
</P>
<P>
The thrift's management, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said, "appeared to 
operate Lincoln mainly for the benefit of (its parent company, American 
Continental Corp.) at the expense of (Lincoln)." 
</P>
<P>
The thrift's 29 Southern California offices remained open, and depositors can 
transact business as usual. Deposits up to $100,000 are insured by the Federal 
Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp. Lincoln has total deposits of $4.4 billion 
in 176,323 accounts. 
</P>
<P>
An oversight team led by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. began operating 
the $5.5-billion thrift at 7 a.m. today to "minimize losses, limit growth and 
ensure that operations are conducted in a safe and sound manner." 
</P>
<P>
Investors who own about $200 million worth of bonds may, however, lose some or 
all of their money as a result of American Continental's filing Thursday for 
protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
The company sold the bonds to customers in Lincoln's branches. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, which represents about 85% of American's assets, 
was not included in Thursday's bankruptcy filing. But federal regulators said 
the filing did include substantial assets in subsidiary operations of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
American Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr. said he filed for bankruptcy after 
federal regulators demanded he relinquish control of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental has tried to sell Lincoln three times since last year. 
Federal regulators opposed the latest plan to sell Lincoln for $200 million to 
a group of investors led by John H. Rousselot, a former congressman from 
Arcadia, because the offer did not include sufficient cash. 
</P>
<P>
Rousselot, named Lincoln's chairman earlier this week, resigned today, 
regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
The bank board named F. Roger Clark to serve as Lincoln's chief executive. 
Clark ran Montfort Savings in Dallas after it was seized by regulators.
