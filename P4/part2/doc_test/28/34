The section that follows describes the NCDs announced in calendar years 1991 and 1992. During that period, HCFA announced
the addition of six new services and the removal of one service. By combining Medicare payment data for physician services
with facility costs data, we were able to estimate the relative costs associated with providing these services. The
coverage of liver transplantation for adults was estimated to cost over $100,000 per procedure, which meets the threshold
to be considered ``of significant cost'' under this proposed rule. Adult liver transplantation is covered for specific
conditions when performed in a facility approved by HCFA as meeting certain institutional coverage criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining services were estimated to have average costs that are well below the $100,000 threshold. These services
are described below.

Extracorporeal Immunoadsorption (ECI)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This procedure, which uses Protein A columns, is covered only for the treatment of patients with Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia
Purpura (ITP) failing other treatments.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Patient selection criteria were changed to remove requirements that patients had to have inducible tachyrhythmia
before implantation or that this technology be used as a treatment of last resort. Although additional patients may
be covered, we believe that the savings in diagnostic costs offset additional costs.

Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This procedure is used in the treatment of obstructive lesions of arteriovenous dialysis fistulas.

Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This surgical procedure is covered for the removal of the gall bladder.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Apheresis (Therapeutic Pheresis)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This autologous medical procedure is covered for specific conditions. Medicare coverage criteria have been updated
to include coverage for procedures performed in a hospital setting (inpatient or outpatient) or in a nonhospital
setting if the patient is under the care of a physician and a physician is also present to direct and supervise the nonphysician
services.

Extracranial-intracranial (EC&hyph;IC) Arterial Bypass
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1991 this surgical procedure was removed from the list of Medicare covered procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only ``significant cost'' NCD service among those listed above is the liver transplant for adults. That NCD was
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as a final notice on April 12, 1991, at 56 FR 15006. The decision to cover liver transplants for adults was based on our
determination that liver transplants are medically reasonable and necessary services if furnished to adult patients
with certain conditions and if furnished by participating facilities that meet specific criteria including patient
selection criteria. Under certain circumstances, coverage of these liver transplants could be effective as early
as March 8, 1990, which was the publication date of the proposed notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. However, Medicare payment for liver transplants for beneficiaries enrolled in risk HMOs and CMPs was not included
in the per capita rates of payment until January 1991. Consequently, risk HMOs and CMPs were forced to absorb any liver
transplant costs (approximately $100,000 per transplant) from March 8, 1990, through December 31, 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Items and services necessary to diagnose a condition for which the recommended therapy is a noncovered service, and
most services furnished as followup care to the noncovered service, are not considered part of that service and are
not included in the payment for that service. Medicare already covers certain diagnostic services, which may lead
to a recommendation that a beneficiary receive therapy that is not covered. In addition, Medicare covers certain
medically necessary services that relate to follow-up care to a noncovered service. For example, for patients who
received liver transplants before March 8, 1990, outpatient diagnostic services preceding the transplant procedure
were covered, as was medically necessary follow-up care after discharge from the hospital for the noncovered transplant
procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hospitalization for the transplant procedure would not have been covered, nor would other services received
directly related to the noncovered procedure, such as the surgeon's fee for the transplant surgery itself. We consider
services that would not have been covered as part of the NCD occurrence. An occurrence includes the actual provision
of a discrete item or service that is the subject of an NCD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any item or service that is already covered, such as diagnostic services followed by a noncovered therapy, as discussed
above, would not be considered as part of the NCD service and thus would not be eligible for payment outside the HMO's
or CMP's monthly rate. An item or service that would not have been covered if furnished as part of a noncovered procedure,
such as the surgeon's fee for a noncovered liver transplant, would qualify for payment outside the HMO's or CMP's monthly
rate, even though it is not itself the subject of the NCD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1861(s)(2)(J) of the Act provides for coverage of prescription drugs used in immunosuppressive therapy
for 1 year following a transplant, only if the organ transplant procedure is a covered service. Therefore, if future
NCDs provide for coverage of transplantation of organs other than the presently covered kidney, liver, and heart,
and are announced after publication of AAPCC rates for the contract period, immunosuppressive therapy following
those organ transplants would also qualify for payment outside the HMO's or CMP's monthly rates.

or respond to them individually. However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specified
