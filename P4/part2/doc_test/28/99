A young man who died in San Francisco over the weekend gave six people a chance 
to live because he served as donor of seven separate major organs. Medical 
officials said the man, whose name, age and cause of death were not released, 
donated the following organs to patients in desperate need: His heart went to a 
person suffering from terminal cardiac disease, and one of his kidneys aided a 
patient with renal disease. His other kidney and his pancreas went to a patient 
with diabetes and renal failure. The man's liver went to a patient whose own 
liver was no longer able to cleanse toxic wastes from the blood. One of his 
lungs helped a woman who had been awaiting a transplant for a year; the other 
lung went to a woman who had spent five years with a lethal lung disease. The 
lung transplants were performed at Stanford University Hospital, while the 
other organs were transplanted into four patients at Pacific Presbyterian 
Medical Center in San Francisco.
