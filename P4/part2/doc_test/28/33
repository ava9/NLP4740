Jamie Fiske, who at the age of 11 months received a liver transplant after her 
father made a public appeal for a donor organ, is suffering internal bleeding 
and was readmitted to University of Minnesota Hospital on Sunday. Doctors said 
they did not know the cause of the bleeding.

Jamie, now 7, last week underwent surgery for removal of an enlarged spleen and
