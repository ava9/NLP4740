A farewell celebration and news conference were planned at the University of

Teresa Smith, 29, who donated part of her liver to her daughter on Nov. 27.

Alyssa was released from the hospital on Monday and has been staying with her 
mother at a nearby residence for the families of out-of-town patients.

Mrs. Smith and her daughter were scheduled to leave O'Hare International 
Airport for their home in the San Antonio suburb of Schertz.

Alyssa would have to return to Chicago for checkups, said hospital spokeswoman 
Mary Fetsch. At home, the child will continue taking drugs to prevent her body 
from rejecting the new organ.
