  [Text] The Livestock Feed Central Research Laboratory 
(Tsukuba City, Ibaragi-ken) of the National Agricultural 
Cooperative Society Federation (Zen No) announced on 5 November 
that for the first time in Japan, a transplanted fertilized egg 
that can produce a cloned cow was separated and further recloned 
to produce second generation ``recloned cows'' successfully. It 
was a step forward towards accomplishing a technology to produce 
large numbers of genetically superior cows from one fertilized 
egg. 
  A clone is a living group that possesses identical genes in 
all respect. The cloning technology to produce such living 
groups have been actively studied for livestocks and the United 
States, in 1987, was the first in the world to succeed in the 
production of cloned cows. 
  In the case of cloned cows, after the cells in the 
fertilized eggs had divided into 16-32 pairs, they are separated 
and transplanted one pair each into another cow's egg in which 
the nucleus had previously been removed. The general procedure 
is to inject the transplanted egg into the cow's uterus. 
  Cows that are born by this procedure are first generation 
clones. However, the Livestock Feed Central Research Laboratory 
had tackled with a method in which the transplanted egg was not 
impregnated into a female cow but instead it was induced to 
perform a second cell division. From these cells, transplanted 
eggs were produced to form second generation cloned cows by 
impregnating into female cows. 
  In the technology of cloning, the repetition of recloning 
leads to inferior growth and conception rates for the 
transplanted egg as each generation is added. However, recloning 
was made possible at the Central Research Laboratory by using a 
certain type of test reagent that activate treats during the 
process of producing the transplanted egg. 
  According to the project leader, Tatsuo Onihara of the 
fertilized egg transplant laboratory, on 3 February of this 
year, the second generation transplanted egg was injected into 
the uterus of a female Holstein and later, the pregnancy was 
confirmed. Nine months later, on 5 November, a calf was born at 
1:30 PM by Caesarean operation. The calf weighed a normal 48 
kgms and was female. 
  In the United States, they have already been successful in 
producing third generation cows and furthermore, it is said that 
they are producing transplanted eggs for sixth generation 
cloning at the laboratory level. 
  Onihara project leader claims, ``In the future, it is 
possible that we will be able to produce infinite number of 
highly competent cows that can produce milk and meat.'' He will 
be presenting his research results at the International Egg 
Fertilization and Transplant Society Meeting to be held in 
Australia next January.
