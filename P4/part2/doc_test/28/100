Chief of Medical Services of the Armed Forces of the Russian 
Federation, by Petr Altunin; place and date not given: "Good 
Health to the Armed Forces"] 
  [Text] Visitor's Card: Ivan Mikhaylovich Chizh 
  He was born in the village of Shilinok in the Berezovsk 
rayon of the Brest oblast. He graduated from the military 
medicine department of the Kuybyshev Medical Institute in 1972, 
and in 1981 from the department of supervisor personnel of the 
Military Medical Academy. In 1987 he became the Chief of Medical 
Service of the Turkestan Military District. In 1991 he was 
appointed the First Deputy Chief, and in October 1993 the Chief 
of the Main Military Medical Directorate of the Ministry of 
Defense, the Chief of Medical Service of the Armed Forces of the 
Russian Federation. He is a Lieutenant-General of Medical 
Service. 
  He is married, with a son who is a student at the 
Military Medical Academy, and a daughter in college. 
  [Altunin] Ivan Mikhaylovich, you were the number two man in 
the medical service of the Armed Forces for more than two years, 
and now you are number one. You undoubtedly have a good idea of 
what our health care is like today, and in particular are well 
acquainted with the status of medical support in the Army and 
Navy. The newspaper assertions which have become commonplace 
recently, that our health is worsening -- are they justified? 
  [Chizh] As far as the country goes, the reduction in the 
living standards of the populace, and in particular the 
worsening in the quality of food, and the lack of social 
protection of large groups of people, especially retirees and 
disabled persons, result in the many negative consequences which 
the papers write about. 
  I must say that in the Army and Navy, the medical indices in 
all basic parameters are comparatively good. Thanks to 
discipline, good organization of personnel, and the high 
qualifications and devotion to duty of military medics in the 
units and on the ships, epidemiological measures are active and 
persistent, and there is strict monitoring of working conditions 
in the Army. 
  [Altunin] Tell me, is the manpower adequate for this? 
Haven't 
you been affected by the reduction in the Armed Forces? 
  [Chizh] The general situation is not a simple one, of 
course, 
and it also affects the status of military medicine. But the Law 
"On the Status of Service Members" and subsequent orders of the 
minister of defense, which raised it to a qualitatively new 
level in the Armed Forces, have entailed not a reduction in 
personnel, but on the contrary, reinforcement of our 
institutions. 
  After all, what were things like before this? We had 
"active" 
service members, as well as generals and senior reserve and 
retired officers who had served 25 years in the Army, receiving 
medical services. But now the contract troops and their families 
are added to that, and also reserve and retired officers, 
including junior ones, discharged with 20 years or more of 
service, and their families. If you count the women and children 
in the garrisons, and the blue and white-collar workers whom we 
also serve, this amounts to around 5 million people. Imagine how 
many medical personnel are needed today! 
  [Altunin] As you see it, what are the reasons for this? 
  [Chizh] There are several. Some are common to all officers, 
particularly the poor living conditions, and for military 
doctors, especially the scarce specialists, there is the 
temptation of finding work in commercial structures. In recent 
years the number of those wanting to continue their training in 
military medical departments has also dropped significantly. 
  [Altunin] So what are you doing? 
  [Chizh] I must say that the package of military laws adopted 
recently, which have somewhat raised the prestige of military 
service, have played their part. But we are doing some things. A 
system of post-graduate physician training has been created, 
including primary specialization, along with systematic 
improvement of medical personnel. Besides this, a significant 
number of physicians have the chance to study in the department 
of supervisor personnel and in clinical residencies. 
  Further, we have begun to successfully recruit women to the 
departments. Incidentally, at present they make up about 5 
percent of medical service officers, and according to 
predictions by the year 2000 they will be 10 to 15 percent of 
the total number. Since last year we have also begun recruiting 
reserve medical service officers on a contract basis. 
  [Altunin] So things have worked out with respect to cadres. 
But where will they serve the doubled contingent of patients, 
these 5 million? After all, you can't spread apart the walls of 
the hospitals and polyclinics, and they aren't building new ones. 
  [Chizh] No, but why must we? They are putting up new 
buildings at the hospitals, even if it is slow, and bed space is 
growing overall. Besides that, we are working actively to expand 
and reconstruct old and so-called adapted premises. In addition, 
a territorial system of medical service is being created. Small 
institutions of different services and combat arms close to one 
another are being combined into base hospitals and polyclinics. 
  The hospitals include specialized departments and offices, 
including vascular surgery, oncology, endoscopy, "artificial 
kidney," ultrasound and others. We are converting polyclinics 
into consulting and diagnostic centers with the corresponding 
reinforcement with qualified specialists and equipment. 
  The 45 Central Polyclinics of the Defense Ministry can serve 
as an example. [A polyclinic] includes 18 treatment and 
diagnostic departments, 12 offices, and an infection/immunology 
laboratory. Last year around 30 thousand patients received 
consultations there. Many of them were provided the necessary 
assistance on the spot, during admittance, using various modern 
methods of examination. Day inpatient facilities are a new and 
undoubtedly progressive type of operation of military 
polyclinics. What are they? After initial reception at the 
office of the physician/therapist or surgeon, the officer is 
sent to the inpatient facility of the polyclinic, where he 
undergoes a complete examination from all the specialists 
involved with his ailment without changing his "life-style." A 
300-bed hospital could not have accommodated the patients who 
have gone through "day inpatient" facilities in the last three 
years. This means convenience for the service members and the 
families, and in itself brings a savings of resources. 
  [Altunin] But we often get letters to the editors from 
military retirees and even cadre officers that there is a long 
waiting list for hospitalization. 
  [Chizh] Yes, this is true, especially in Moscow there are 
still not enough places. Of course it is not a matter of urgent 
assistance. There are no problems with that. This has to do with 
planned treatments. But I already mentioned above that this 
problem is being resolved. Of course, as before we give priority 
to war veterans and disabled veterans and their equivalent 
categories. 
  [Altunin] Ivan Mikhaylovich, letters of another type also 
come to the editors, from service members and members of their 
families suffering from grave illnesses. They persistently 
request that they be sent abroad for treatment. What do you say 
to this? 
  [Chizh] We get such letters at the GVMU [Main Military 
Medical Directorate] too. As a human being I can understand 
these people. Something terrible happens and you start rushing 
about. Only, I must say that recently the capabilities of our 
military treating facilities have grown significantly. For 
example, at the Main Hospital imeni N.N. Burdenko, they have 
done more than a hundred kidney transplants, are performing 
unique cardiac operations and laparoscopic surgery (without 
cutting into the abdominal cavity), and at the Central Hospital 
imeni A.A. Vishnevskiy, they are successfully doing aortal 
coronary bypasses for ischemic disease, and implanting 
pacemakers for cardiac arrhythmias. At the Military Medical 
Academy they are transplanting bone marrow to patients with 
oncological blood diseases. In treatment practice, the latest 
attainments of anesthesiology, resuscitation, microsurgery and 
others are being used more and more. 
  As for trips abroad for treatment, that is a very individual 
matter. But the corresponding expense item was not provided for 
in the estimate of expenditures in the Defense Ministry. I know 
there are very limited capabilities in the Ministry of Health of 
the Russian Federation. 
  [Altunin] Afghanistan, where you saw both blood and death, 
and directly organized medical support, and also the Chernobyl 
accident, the earthquake in Armenia, and "hot spots" in 
different regions of the country, has all of this "shaken up" 
our military medicine? Has it forced some changes? 
  [Chizh] Our medicine has enormous experience from the Great 
Patriotic War, and we continue to study and utilize it. 
Nonetheless, the recent events which you mentioned have forced 
us to revise much, and to put the accent on military field 
surgery. The basic conclusion was to create an emergency medical 
service. Besides the center, it calls for special-purpose 
medical detachments in the Armed Services and districts and also 
for a number of non-organic formations in military hospitals. 
There is precedence: In the Hospital imeni Burdenko they have 
already created "flying laboratories." When the situation 
requires it, a group of doctors and nurses will head for "hot 
spots" in a small special aircraft to provide rapid and 
effective assistance to the injured. This year five medical 
"special-purpose elements" will be organized. All of this within 
the general doctrine of assuring a high level of combat 
readiness for actions in extreme situations. 
  [Altunin] About emergency situations, Ivan Mikhaylovich. Did 
you notice that there were two military medics among the ten 
people named by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA in its "Exploit-93"? 
  [Chizh] How could I not? Thank you. Extracting a mine fuze 
from the body of a Georgian lad, which in the course of the 
surgery might cost the life of the surgeon himself, Colonel 
Shurenkov, that is of course an exploit. But I must say that 
nowadays such selflessness in military medics is more the rule 
than the exception. For example, the medical chief of the 201st 
Division, Lietenant-Colonel Valeriy Sergeyevich Arutyunov, 
during an attack on the 12th Element of the Moscow Border 
Detachment himself personally rushed in on an APC and while 
under fire from the Mujaheddin provided assistance to the 
wounded, and carried them from the battlefield. And a 
just-recent incident: The chief surgeon of the Armed Forces, 
Major-General of Medical Service Pavel Georgiyevich Bryusov was 
at the operating table for nine hours, removing the trachea and 
simultaneously the esophagus of an oncological patient, and then 
restoring them with prostheses. 
  [Altunin] A few words about medical supplies. 
  [Chizh] You know what the general supply background is in 
the 
country. The basic problems come from a shortage of financing. 
Nonetheless, with the support of the Defense Ministry and with 
the assistance of the Ministry of Health and our own 
initiatives, I can state firmly that we have managed to maintain 
the treatment-and-prevention institutions at a level which 
allows them to fully provide all types of medical assistance. We 
have signed more than 600 contracts in the amount of 20.8 
billion rubles for delivery of 7 thousand items of medical 
technical equipment and gear from 700 enterprises and 
joint-stock companies. 
  We are also given hard currency to buy imported equipment, 
but very little. But I want to say that we have now organized 
the production of many nationally-produced medications and 
instruments which are equal to the foreign analogues, or even 
surpass them. This includes, for example, ultrasound units, 
lithotripsy devices, gammascopic units and much else. 
  [Altunin] We know that for the time being article 16 of the 
Law "On the Status of Service Members" is "not working." 
  [Chizh] Some provisions, having to do with medical support 
of 
all service members and their families are already working, as I 
mentioned earlier. As for the payment of monetary compensation 
in the amount of the average cost of travel, that we don't have. 
A draft statute "On Procedures for Compensation of Expenses 
Associated With Provision of Medical Assistance, Sanatorium and 
Spa Treatment, and Organized Rest of Service Members, Civilians 
Discharged From Military Service, and Members of Their Families, 
as Well as Payment of Monetary Compensation for Treatment" has 
been sent to the government. Unfortunately, the adoption of this 
statute is being delayed due to the lack of financial resources. 
  I should add that since many military health resorts "went" 
to the CIS countries, and particularly to Ukraine, we are 
expanding the spa system in Russia. New buildings are springing 
up in the Moscow region and in the Stavropol and Krasnodar 
krays, and last year's plan was met. In addition we have 
acquired ("ransomed") from other ministries a number of 
sanatoria which were becoming run-down. This "deal" was made by 
the Airborne Troops, the Transbaykal Military District, and the 
Space Troops. Talks are under way with Ukraine regarding joint 
use of the Black Sea military health resorts. 
  [Altunin] Ivan Mikhaylovich, the last word: How do you 
yourself, a doctor, set an example in improving health? 
  [Chizh] For now I get along without medicine. I love 
volleyball and skiing. I have to say that recently because I 
have neglected these "procedures" because I have been so busy, 
and have limited myself to intensive morning exercise. I think 
that when I get into the new routine, I will make up for it.
