Tumor Removed: Former first lady Nancy Reagan Wednesday had a small cancerous 
tumor removed, just beneath her left nostril, a family spokesman said at St. 
Marys Hospital in Rochester, Minn. In 1987, doctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital 
removed her left breast and adjoining lymph glands after a cancerous tumor was 
found.

She is otherwise in excellent health, the spokesman said.

No Go: Mothers Against Drunk Driving will not be allowed to parade images of 
death at a wine festival in Kalamazoo, Mich. MADD's display was to have 
featured headstones for the Sept. 8 parade. The float was turned down because 
its theme wasn't consistent with the rest of the parade, said event chairman 
Brian Caplan. Michael Hughes, president of the local MADD chapter, wasn't 
worried about drinking at the event: "I'm worried about when they get behind 
the wheel."

Right Rub: Pia Zadora had a stiff neck when she went to WNBC-TV in New York for 
an interview recently, so her hairdresser began rubbing it. Sen. Al D'Amato 
(R-N.Y.) also happened to be in the studio and said: "Here, let me try that," 
according to the New York Daily News. Said Zadora: "He managed to get rid of 
the cricks in my neck without so much as breaking his chain of thought."

Doing Better: Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, who performed the world's first successful 
liver transplant in 1967, was released from Pittsburgh's Presbyterian 
University Hospital Tuesday, four days after undergoing a coronary artery 
bypass. Starzl, 64, has performed hundreds of transplant operations at the same 
hospital.
