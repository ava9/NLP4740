Ingemar Stenmark decided against joining the U.S. Pro Tour this winter, but 
Swedish skiers on the circuit are doing well without him. 
</P>
<P>
Niklas Lindqvist, born in Stockholm 25 years ago, won the slalom of the 
America's Opening Cup Sunday and left Alpine Meadows with $7,100. He trailed 
Roland Pfeifer by 0.108 of a second after the first run of the final, but 
Pfeifer, from Austria, fell near the finish of their second run, giving 
Lindqvist the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Mahre of Yakima, Wash., made it to the quarterfinals after going out in 
the round of 16 during Saturday's giant slalom, but the three-time World Cup 
champion crash-landed off the first of two jumps and fell an automatic 1.5 
seconds behind Austrian Werner Herzog after their first run. 
</P>
<P>
His 0.236-second margin over Herzog in the second run left him well short in 
the combined reckoning. 
</P>
<P>
"The heel binding ripped right out of my left ski when I landed," Mahre said. 
"It was weird, something that's never happened to me before." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kelly, a former assistant coach on the U.S. Ski Team now with the firm that 
supplies Mahre with bindings, was dumbfounded afterward. "I didn't mount Phil's 
bindings myself," he said, "and I can't really explain how it happened." 
</P>
<P>
But Kelly did a double-take when he opened a fortune cookie after eating the 
Oriental meal served in the hospitality tent. Said the fortune: 
</P>
<P>
"You will soon be in another line of work." 
</P>
<P>
In the second round, Mahre had won a battle of 1984 Olympic gold medalists when 
he defeated Max Julen. Mahre, who took the slalom at Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, 
edged Julen, the 1984 giant slalom champion, by 0.149 of a second in the first 
run, then breezed into the quarterfinals as Julen fell near the end of their 
second duel. 
</P>
<P>
Lindqvist appeared to be on a collision course to meet fellow Swede Jorgen 
Sundqvist in the semifinals. Last season, the first for both on the tour, 
Sundqvist was the overall champion, and Lindqvist was third, just behind Mahre. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sundqvist fell on his second run in the quarterfinals against Joerg 
Seiler of Switzerland, who went on to give Lindqvist a scare before losing 
their semifinal by a slim combined time differential of 0.009 of a second. 
</P>
<P>
Lindqvist had been eliminated in the second round Saturday as Bernhard Knauss 
of Austria won the giant slalom, but he said Sunday: "I wasn't worried. Today 
was a new day." 
</P>
<P>
And besides, Knauss had to scratch from the slalom because of a partial 
ligament tear in his right knee and a partial separation of his left shoulder 
suffered in a finish-line spill the day before.
