Hometown favorite Rudi Nierlich of Austria won the men's second giant slalom of 
the ski season today, finishing ahead of veteran Swiss ace Pirmin Zurbriggen 
and Italian star Alberto Tomba. 
</P>
<P>
Nierlich was fastest in the first heat and second-fastest in the second run for 
a winning total of 2 minutes, 44.72 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Zurbriggen was second in 2:45.10 and Tomba third in 2:45.26. 
</P>
<P>
Tomaz Cizman of Yugoslavia was fourth in 2:45.55 and Austrian-born Marc 
Girardelli of Luxembourg finished fifth in 2:45.74. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not nervous at all today," the 22-year-old Nierlich said, hinting that 
he has matured since last season, when his nerves would sometimes fail him. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that Zurbriggen was leading" midway through the second heat, he said, 
"but then I did not do a lot of pondering and just went down full speed. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the kind of track where you had to try and ski not too aggressively 
but ease through the gates." 
</P>
<P>
The Austrian team was bent on getting one man among the leaders. Four 
Austrians, including Hans Enn, abandoned the race. Enn suffered a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Tomba, an Olympic double gold medalist in Calgary, Canada, last year, could 
have done much better had he not made a mistake in the first heat that cost him 
time. 
</P>
<P>
A good track and the fine weather helped young, lesser known skiers starting 
with high starting numbers to make it into the top 30 group for the second 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
Ole-Christian Furuseth of Norway, with starting number 51, finished sixth, and 
West German Michael Eder was 10th with starting number 55. 
</P>
<P>
The top American was Tiger Shaw of Stowe, Vt., who finished 16th in 2:48.43.
