A momentous first week of the Winter Olympics in Albertville ends today:
records have been set and buckets of tears shed. The Games used to be dogged
by political imbroglios; now commercial questions are causing off-piste
problems.
For the French the spectacle of a Winter Olympics on Gallic soil, or snow,
has been greeted with characteristic panache. A son et lumiere Olympics
symbol is projected on the Paris skyline every night. Newspapers are packed
with pictures of bob-hatted French contestants and reports of every medal
win, no matter how obscure the event.
Whether citizens of the Savoie region, home of Albertville, will be quite so
enthusiastic when they tot up the bill for hosting the event remains to be
seen. 'Les jeux paieront les jeux' ('The games will pay for the games') was
the catchphrase of Mr Michel Barnier, the ambitious young conservative
politican who dreamed up the idea, together with Mr Jean-Claude Killy,
France's triple gold medalist from the Grenoble winter Olympics. The
organisers were confident that they could meet the original FFr2.9bn (Pounds
800m) bill through a combination of government subsidies, sponsorship and
sales of television rights.
Unfortunately for Mr Barnier and his fellow Savoyards, the final tally will
be closer to FFr3.9bn. More than FFr1bn has been spent on equipment, double
the budgeted amount. The bobsleigh run alone cost FFr220m, rather than
FFr130m.
At the same time less cash has rolled into the organisers' coffers than they
hoped. The main problem has been the effect of exchange rate changes on the
sale of television rights to the all-important US networks. The rights were
sold in 1987, when there were FFr9 to the dollar. Now a dollar buys less
than FFr5.5 and the organisers' insurance will not fully cover the
shortfall.
Nobody will know the real cost of the Albertville Games until the accounts
are published in May or June. But observers believe the Games are heading
for a loss of FFr250m to FFr500m. The critical question is: who will pay?
The Savoyards have already started muttering that whoever does stump up the
extra cash, it will not be them.
The sponsors have already paid their share, and are too engrossed in their
own business battles to pay much attention to the balance sheet of the Games
as a whole.
The most hard-fought contest concerns the use of the Olympics in marketing
campaigns. It has pitted the Visa credit card company and the International
Olympic Committee on one hand against American Express on the other. Visa,
one of 12 official sponsors of both the winter and the summer games, is
reported to have contributed some Dollars 20m of the total Dollars 170m
sponsorship budget in The Olympic Programme (TOP) scheme. The scheme - set
up by the International Olympic Committee at the 1988 games to amalgamate
winter and summer sponsorship - is filled by multinationals such as Kodak,
Matsushita, Coca-Cola and IBM.
Amex was the official card sponsor of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, but
declined to support the 1988 games.
Visa stepped into the breach in 1988 and exercised its first refusal rights
to sponsor this year's Games. The company has conducted a clever advertising
campaign in the US, proudly proclaiming that only its credit card is worth
carrying in Albertville - and implying that the Amex card would not be
welcome.
American Express has responded to this 'comparative' advertising blitz with
its own commercials, which contain numerous references to the Olympics, all
of which fall short of claiming any official sponsorship role.
As a result, Mr Dick Pound, chairman of the IOC marketing commission, has
vigorously attacked Amex for alleged 'ambush marketing': he believes Amex is
undermining Visa's position as lead sponsor of the Olympics without paying a
cent to towards the estimated Dollars 800m cost of staging the Winter Games.
For its part, Amex argues that its advertising campaign is simply trying to
redress Visa's alleged distortions - the implication that Amex cards are not
welcome in the Albertville region. Ms Deborah Botwood, head of Visa's
European public affairs operation, says Visa 'does not feel it is an Amex
versus Visa issue, more an IOC and Amex affair; I wish we could forget all
about this.'
The IOC and American Express were, in fact, already embroiled in litigation
before the Games even began. The committee recently sued Amex in France over
alleged improper use of the Olympic symbol, the five interlinked rings. Last
year an issue of Expressions, Amex's magazine for card-holders, ran an
article about the Olympics, illustrated by Barcelona's summer games mascot,
a cartoon dog called Cobi. Wherever Cobi goes, he carries with him the
Olympic, five-ring symbol.
Amex claims it had permission from the Spanish Olympic Committee, the
national organising body, to use Cobi, but on February 4, a French court
ruled against Amex and in favour of the IOC. At the same time, the court
ruled in favour of Amex, against the IOC, on a related matter. Amex is
currently giving to customers in the Savoie region, home to Albertville, a
guide to the Games, using caricatures of skiers, skaters and so forth, which
the IOC claimed were similar to caricatures it is using on official
literature. The court decided the IOC's claim was groundless. Half-time
score: IOC 1, Amex 1.
Such litigation might seem to signify nothing more than a short-lived
snowstorm on the slopes. But with the winter and summer Olympics combined
now attracting something in the region of Dollars 1.84bn of total
international sponsorship, it is easier to understand the sensitivity of all
concerned. As Mr Pound put it: 'When the only thing you have to sell are the
aspirations of youth and five rings, then misappropriation of intellectual
property becomes a very serious matter.'
Several observers believe that, in the long term, legal disputes and public
mud-slinging between sponsors may inflict serious damage to international
sport. Mr Ian Muir, chairman of the UK's Institute of Sports Sponsorship and
Coca-Cola's UK manager for external affairs, said: 'If ambush marketing is
allowed to continue then the major companies will look again at their
sponsorship.' Such sentiments help to explain Mr Pound's anxieties and the
IOC's determination to seek legal redress against companies that seek to
imply a closer connection with the Olympics than they actually have.
Any drop in sponsorship would also affect television advertising, since the
biggest sponsors also tend to be the largest buyers of TV advertising space.
According to Mr Pound, Albertville's TV ratings have been 'extraordinarily
good.' CBS, the US network which has paid Dollars 243m for world coverage
rights to the Winter Olympics, and is likely to spend another Dollars 100m
in production costs, 'will not lose money', he said.
In fact, CBS has been thrilled about its Albertville ratings. British-born
network boss, Mr Howard Stringer, has been telephoning journalists to draw
their attention to a 24 per cent audience share on the opening ceremony and
a 33 per cent audience share on the dramatic men's downhill. Both figures
were considerably ahead of rival network ABC's viewing figures for the
Calgary Winter games in 1988.
CBS declines to comment on the pricing of its advertising. Overall the
network is showing a total of 116 hours' coverage with the main events shown
in prime time, recorded if necessary.
In the UK, with contestants destined to come in the lower 50s in the
rankings, the Albertville Olympics have not exactly set the ratings alight.
BBC figures are likely to show that it attracted between 6m and 7m viewers
for the opening ceremony and slightly more than 4m for the men's downhill on
BBC2 - up on Calgary, partly because the events are in European time. The
Games should give BBC2 a brief respite in the ratings battle and take its
audience share to about 13 per cent compared with the less than 9 per cent
that it attracted the previous week.
As the second and final week of the Winter Olympics gets under way, there is
only a short breathing space for television networks to finalise their
coverage plans for the Summer Olympics in Barcelona. And executives from the
world's largest companies will no doubt be preparing for what could prove
another gruelling sponsorship battle.
