Whatever the weather, much of the talk at this weekend's Burghley Remy
Martin Horse Trials will be of heat and humidity.
Most top event riders with an expectation of competing in the 1996 Olympics
at Atlanta are at Burghley. So too is the equine veterinary research team
whose expertise helped avoid catastrophe in the heatwave at the World
Equestrian Games in the Netherlands last month.
In October, the scientists have to give advice to the International
Equestrian Federation on how to conduct a safe three-day-event in the
near-tropical conditions of mid-summer Georgia. Opinions are polarising as
to whether the whole enterprise is desirable or possible.
King William and Mary Thomson, a combination that has won Badminton and
competed at the Barcelona Olympics, finished the WEG cross-country section
with the horse on rubber-legs. A heatwave pushed temperatures in The Hague
to 36'C, with 90 per cent humidity. Thomson had to nurse the massive
gelding, famous for his big-heartedness, over the last few fences.
'He just could not cope with the humidity, like a lot of the larger horses.
I had never seen him like that. He was very distressed and so was I,' said
Thomson, part of the gold medal-winning British team.
Although the pairing is likely to be well to the fore in the selectors'
minds, the rider is adamant that the horse will not endure those conditions
again. 'There is no way in the world I would take him to Atlanta,' said
Thomson.
Michael Clayton, editor of Horse &amp; Hound magazine, has moved from scepticism
to outright opposition over the Georgia venue.
'It is ridiculous. Every horseman knows it is too hot in Atlanta,' said
Clayton. 'I am not a sentimentalist over horses, but the competitors are not
sitting on skis or boats. These are living creatures.'
He believes that the sports's governing body agreed to the demands of the
International Olympic Committee for a compact, one-site Games, because of
apprehension that the IOC hierarchy wished to drop equestrianism and would
use any local difficulties as a lever.
Clayton says that the best decision would be a shift of venue to temperate
New England or Pennsylvania. He attended the 1978 world championships in
Lexington, Kentucky, and was appalled at the effect of extreme heat and
humidity on the animals.
'Some of the top horses pushed hardest at Lexington were never any good
again,' said Clayton.
Many, indeed most, top event horses are no longer owned by their riders. As
the sport's popularity and media profile increases, the animals increase in
value to such an extent that they are sold to a sponsor.
The Burghley entry list gives a classic example. The printed form shows Nick
Burton (son of former England rugby international Mike Burton) as owner /
rider of Bertie Blunt. A last-minute handwritten addendum gives Mark Todd of
New Zealand as rider, with his new sponsor Bond International (a large UK
tyre distributor) as the owner.
Japanese interests scouted the stables at Burghley last year. When Brynley
Powell's promising young horse I'm Sure went well around a demanding course,
he was snapped up and flown off to Tokyo.
Corporate backers may well be unwilling to hazard their equine investment in
the stifling heat of a Confederate summer.
However, scientists such as Professor Leo Jeffcott of Cambridge University's
veterinary department have been researching climatic stress in relation to
eventing for nearly two years. He was in the Netherlands for the WEG and
says that conditions there were at the margins of safety.
'We would not want the horses to become any more tired or hotter than they
were at The Hague,' said Jeffcott.
Beneath a giant marquee to provide shade, the horses were 'aggressively
cooled,' as Jeffcott's report puts it. Six tons of ice and a battery of
hoses were used.
Many of the same animals will be at Burghley, wired to transmit heart and
temperature functions to the vets' computers. This data, plus a recent field
test in Atlanta, will provide the basis for recommendations as to how the
three-day-event will need to be made less physically rigorous in Atlanta.
Shorter tracks, lower fences, and longer rests are likely.
'There will be modifications but we are confident of keeping the horses
safe,' said Jeffcott.
Not everyone is content. Clayton questioned the value of medal won in 'a
bastardised event'.
'This is basically a winter sport,' he said. 'You do not run an Alpine ski
competition in July or a yacht race on a dry lake.'
