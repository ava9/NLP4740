The selection of a location for the Winter Olympics has always thrown up
more dilemmas and anomalies than the summer counterpart. Few sites in the
climate necessary for winter sports have the resources necessary to cope
with the influx of contestants, officials, spectators and media, and, in
particular, with the demands of television.
The commercialisation of the Winter Olympics - and the professional status
of some of the competitors - also appear in sharper relief against a
background of snow-covered hills. Indeed, Avery Brundage, president of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) from 1952 to 1972 believed the Winter
Games had no place in the Olympic movement, a view which has long since
given way under the subsequent regimes of Lord Killanin and Juan Antonio
Samaranch to a new policy of accepting commercial realities while trying to
avoid the worst excesses.
The question, therefore, is whether the Lillehammer games, which take place
only two years after the last games at Albertville in order to put summer
and winter games on different four-year cycles, can resolve these dilemmas
and create an event which will be both successful and fully in line with
Olympic ideals.
It does start with the advantage of a central Olympic Village based on a
town of 23,000. Its predecessor in 1992, Albertville in France, was
criticised as a Games wholly tailored to TV. To the athletes, Albertville
was a set of disparate, mini world championships, not an Olympics where they
could chat and pass time with people from other disciplines, a serious
objective of any Games.
In Norway, seven of the 12 sports, as well as the opening and closing
ceremonies, will be staged in Lillehammer's Olympic Park - all its
facilities merged carefully with the terrain in what must be the most
environmentally sensitive Winter Games.
The Birkebeineren Ski Stadium hosting the cross-country is a part of it, and
within walking distance of the town centre. The free-style skiing stadium is
also here, staging aerials for the first time as a full event, and the
moguls (bumps) introduced at Albertville.
The ski jumps are fashioned against a nearby hillside 'like a drop of
liquid.' It is, we are told, an architectural solution to the problem of
accommodating 120-metre and 90-metre jumps and 50,000 spectators.
The Hakon Hall, housing the big ice hockey matches, is also designed to
blend into the landscape as one of the many 'green goals' which the
organising committee has set for itself.
Fifty kilometres and about an hour's drive to the north, Kvitfjell will
stage the men's and women's downhill and super giant slalom. Its style is
more Canadian, even Scottish, than Alpine. The 3,150-metre downhill course
falls 850 metres from the treeless heights of Norway's geologically ancient
mountains through a belt of forest, pastures, then more conifers, to the
valley floor. One big jump just before the finish will send racers flying
over the Oslo-Trondheim railway line.
Bernhard Russi, Switzerland's former Olympic and world downhill champion,
has designed it with much more chance of approbation than was won by Val
d'Isere's visually stunning but cliff-like course which had even the
champion, Austria's Patrick Ortlieb, declaring he would never want to ski it
again. The checks were so fierce that at one point near the end the racers
almost ground to a halt.
Slaloms are at Hafjell, down-valley from Kvitfjell, while on the other flank
of Lake Mjosa, at the outpost of Hunderfossen, bobsleigh and luge are
serviced by runs almost invisible except when floodlit at night.
The southernmost venues, about an hour south of Lillehammer, are at Hamar, a
small town where the ice rink will host figure skating, short-track skating
and speed skating. Hamar's Olympic Hall resembles a massive Viking longship
turned upside down. Equally striking is the nearby Gjovik ice rink. It is a
massive underground cavern blasted out of the rock in the centre of the town
and entered via a 150-metre tunnel. Some of the ice hockey will be staged
there.
Norway's pride is that it is the cradle of skiing. The Nordic Games long
pre-dated the Olympics and the role of the melancholy but remarkable
peasant, Sondre Norheim, in fashioning the modern ski shape and fixed
binding, is as fetching as that of Fridtjof Nansen. The explorer's book By
Ski Across Greenland, published in 1890 and translated into many languages,
alerted the world outside Scandinavia to the pleasures of skiing.
When the XVII Winter Olympic Games are completed on February 27, eight men
will leave Lillehammer on the 16,000-kilometre journey to Nagano, Japan -
hosts of the 1998 Games - using only man, dog and sail-power as they
traverse the northern coastline of Russia and Siberia before crossing the
Bering Strait to Alaska and thence by Aleutian Island hops to Japan.
With all their modern contrivance, the Olympics retain a thread of community
spirit. The Norwegian ski teams are raising what funds they can for the city
of Sarajevo, where the ski hills now are used for shelling. Lillehammer's
XVII Games will surely convey a better message to the world.
