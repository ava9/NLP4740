It has been barely three weeks since the international racing season started, 
and already a high percentage of the world's top skiers have gone flying off 
bumps, crashing into fences and otherwise knocking themselves off the slopes 
for days, weeks or months. 
</P>
<P>
The latest string of accidents occurred during World Cup downhill training at 
Val Gardena, Italy, where in the last two days: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Peter Mueller of Switzerland, downhill silver medalist in both the 1988 
Winter Olympics and the 1989 World Championships, fell in a bumpy stretch of 
the course, tore ligaments in his left knee and is expected to be lost for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mueller's teammate, Philip Schuler, and Austria's Gerhard Pfaffenbichler 
and Peter Wirnsberger II suffered knee injuries on those same "camel's bumps" 
and will be sidelined indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Although questions have been raised about the safety precautions being taken by 
organizers of this and other World Cup events, one racer, Norwegian Attle 
Skaardahl, told the Associated Press that the Val Gardena course was safe, 
adding: "You can face risks only if you are not fast enough at the bumps or 
undecided about the line to follow." 
</P>
<P>
Swiss star Pirmin Zurbriggen said Mueller crashed "because he was clearly 
uncertain about whether to jump or go around the bumps." 
</P>
<P>
These accidents happened less than a week after mishaps that felled: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alberto Tomba of Italy, a double Olympic gold medalist in 1988, who broke 
his collarbone in a super-giant slalom at Val d'Isere, France, last Sunday and 
will be out until the middle of January. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg, a three-time World Cup overall champion, who 
suffered a severe kidney bruise when he smashed through a plastic fence during 
another super-G race at Sestriere, Italy, on Tuesday and will be unable to ski 
again until after the holiday break, Jan. 6-7 at Kranjska Gora, Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
Of the course at Sestriere, Zurbriggen said: "Safety along the track was not 
good enough," and added that it was as fast and technically demanding as a 
downhill. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the following were victims: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tamara McKinney of the United States, a former World Cup champion and 
women's combined gold medalist in last February's World Championships, who 
injured her left knee during training on a Swiss glacier in mid-October and may 
never race again. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vreni Schneider of Switzerland, the defending World Cup women's champion 
and a double Olympic gold medalist in 1988, who underwent arthroscopic surgery 
this week after jamming her left knee during a practice downhill run Dec. 6 at 
Steamboat Springs, Colo., and will not return until competition resumes in 
Europe Jan. 6-7 at Piancavallo, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michael Mair of Italy, Martin Hangl of Switzerland and Helmut Mayer of 
Austria, each of whom have missed races with one injury or another. 
</P>
