Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are attempting to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They are spending their final weeks in North
America.
Was there not a movie in which all the waxworks came to life? Well, that is
how it has seemed in Telluride, Colorado, where we have been consorting
almost night and day with some of skiing's legends.
They are here for a tournament of champions and we are here to watch. We are
also skiing a little - although I made my excuses when Franz Klammer
suggested I should ski in the pro-am race.
Winter or summer, Telluride is one of the most beautiful places in Colorado,
and the skiing - down steep gladed trails under a consistently dark blue sky
 -has been outstanding for early December.
One problem, however, is that you have no idea which of your skiing gods may
be peering down at you from a lift. For example, will Klammer - for whom
Telluride is something of a second home - notice that I still have the same
bad habits he tried to cure me of two years ago at his ski clinic in Copper
Mountain?
He should at least be impressed that Lucy and I are getting better at not
falling over. Lucy recently went 300 miles (the best part of a month)
without a tumble, and what is perhaps strange is that after almost a year of
skiing, we have both fallen exactly the same number of times: 161, or about
every 20 miles.
The people sharing the dance floor with us at a Wild West party at Gorrono's
mid-mountain restaurant share six Olympic gold medals, three silvers, two
bronze and 13 World Cup titles. Now they are about to battle for Dollars
200,000 prize money in the Tournament of Champions series.
Every other person is famous: there is Klammer, Bill Johnson (the first
American - in 1984 - to win an Olympic gold for downhill), Franz Weber (six
times World Speed Skiing champion), Leonhard Stock (1980 Olympic downhill
gold medal at Lake Placid), Steve Podborski ('Crazy Canuck' winner of eight
World Cup races and the 1980 World Cup downhill title) and the Mahre
Brothers (Phil and Steve) who won all kinds of World Cup and Olympic races.
Meanwhile, what of the unheralded progress of the un-bemedalled Wilson and
Dicker?
Our 40 pairs of socks, purchased as a job lot in London's Queensgate 12
months ago are all holed. But rather like us, they have all lasted the
course. We also have holes in all our gloves, and I have a hole in my only
remaining pair of shoes.
Lucy cut my hair quite nicely but I have since had it tarted up by a
professional. Lucy cut her own fringe too short and has acquired a gamine
look.
We have smart new Degre 7 suits, but our Financial Times and Ski The Summit
logos and those of all our other sponsors have had to be cut from our old
suits and attached to the new ones.
Thanks to Fran Newitt, our tireless UK co-ordinator, our mail still finds
us. Most of it is of the 'Dear Sir, Unless you . . .' variety from banks and
credit card companies, but we did have one letter from Robert Redford
welcoming us to Sundance, his ski area in Utah.
Ski the Summit, our principal sponsor, which has tried to keep our debtors
at bay, is making plans for an interesting finale to our trip: it is hiring
a helicopter to fly us between each of its four resorts so that we can ski
one symbolic run at Breckenridge, Keystone, Copper Mountain and Arapahoe
Basin without going near a ski-lift. We will then be taken to Denver for our
final flight to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where this whole crazy business began
a year earlier.
Since we were unable to ski on August 22 - the International Date Line meant
we went straight from August 21 to August 23 - we have decided to ski on
January 1 to ensure that we have skied on 365 consecutive days.
After that, I am looking forward to a day off. Lucy, on the other hand,
wants the trip to go on for ever.
In Colorado, Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker stayed at the Vintage Hotel,
Winter Park; the Sonnenalp Hotel in Vail; the Hotel Jerome in Aspen; and the
Ice House in Telluride.
