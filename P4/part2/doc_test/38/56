NEWSWIRE: BROWNING WINS TITLE; BOWMAN SECOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canada's Kurt Browning put on a dazzling display of jumping, including a 
trademark quadruple, to edge Chris Bowman of Van Nuys for the men's gold medal 
at the World Figure Skating Championships Thursday in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, skating immediately after Browning, came through with a showy, flowing 
performance but had to be content with the silver. 
</P>
<P>
Poland's Grzegorz Filipowski upset an error-prone Alexandr Fadeev of the Soviet 
Union to take the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
Browning, fifth after the compulsory figures and second going into the final 
free-skating program, received seven marks of 5.9 for technical merit and four 
for artistic impression. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, the U.S. champion, was third going into the free skating behind Fadeev 
and Browning. 
</P>
<P>
Browning made one small slip halfway through the routine when he landed off 
balance on a triple axel but repeated the jump correctly in combination 15 
seconds later to earn Canada its fourth men's gold medal in the event and 
repeat countryman Brian Orser's 1987 success. 
</P>
<P>
Browning, 22, was sixth last year and eighth at the 1988 Calgary Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. champion Jill Trenary made a solid start in her bid for the women's title 
by placing second in the compulsory figures behind European champion Claudia 
Leistner of West Germany.
