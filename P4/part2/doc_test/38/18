Pardon Joanna Ng if she doesn't throw a triple salchow when she is compared to 
Tiffany Chin. Ng, a figure-skating phenom, is flattered by the comparison, but 
she prefers to be recognized for her own achievements. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Tiffany was a really good skater," said Ng, 11, of Woodland Hills. 
"But I think that I can be better than her if I keep working. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I say to myself, 'Well, Tiffany did this move, but did this wrong 
and did this wrong.' I say I'm going to do this better and this better than 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Ng (pronounced Ing) is off to a strong start. 
</P>
<P>
Ng won the silver medal in the Novice Division of the U.S. Figure Skating 
Championships at Salt Lake City in March, missing first place by only one-tenth 
of a point. She was the youngest skater ever to win a medal at the nationals 
and she accomplished the feat against Novice opponents who ranged in age from 
12 to 16. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't really disappointed (about failing to win)," Ng said. "I was the 
youngest (skater) and I'll be older and more ready next year." In 1991, Ng will 
compete in the Junior class against opponents at least four years older. 
</P>
<P>
Ng has a specific goal, one that Chin never achieved. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to win the gold medal in the Olympics," Ng said. "I want to have a 
title, and I think that the Olympics will bring me higher." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Toluca Lake's Chin was regarded as the premier skater in the nation, 
winning the U.S. Seniors national skating championship. Chin, a fourth-place 
finisher in the Sarajevo Winter Olympics in 1984, was called the favorite to 
win a gold medal in the Calgary Winter Olympics four years later. But a muscle 
imbalance in her legs in 1985 forced Chin off skates and subsequently ended her 
competitive career. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly many people in this sport feel that Tiffany never achieved her 
potential," said Frank Carroll, who coached Chin and now coaches Ng at the Ice 
Castles International Training Center in Lake Arrowhead. "It is very important 
to watch the physical development. It is an extremely physically demanding 
sport." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said that it is not surprising that Ng and Chin are compared so often. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many parallels," he said. "Both are Chinese, both are very advanced, 
and both are wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Ng prides herself on her ability to play well to an audience. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my favorite part about skating," she said. "When I skate in front of an 
audience and the audience gets behind me, it brings me up and I skate better.' 
</P>
<P>
The ebullient sixth-grade student at A.E. Wright Middle School in Calabasas 
understands that skating is a full-time activity. It doesn't leave much time to 
socialize. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my friends are skating friends because I am at the rinks so much," Ng 
said. "But I don't mind." 
</P>
<P>
Each morning at 5 a.m., Ng skates at Pickwick Ice Arena in Burbank or at Conejo 
Valley Ice Arena under Coach Doug Varve. Her blades are strapped on again after 
school. She travels to Lake Arrowhead to practice with Carroll as often as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
It is a grueling schedule, incorporating freestyle skating, compulsory figures 
practice and dance. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't mind when I have to go to bed early, because I love to skate so 
much," said Ng, who turns 12 in August. "It doesn't bother me when I have to 
miss a birthday party or can't go to a movie with my friends because I 
understand that I have to compromise." 
</P>
<P>
Ng does little compromising on the ice, performing extremely technical 
routines. She has been doing triple jumps (three full rotations in the air) 
since she was 9, and performs a Biehlman spin, a dangerous move in which she 
spins on one leg while holding the other leg above her head. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to do a lot of different moves," Ng said. "I like to jump the best, but 
I like the variety in my routines." 
</P>
<P>
Ng believes that Carroll "brings the sparkle out" in her programs. His style of 
teaching is sophisticated. He teaches difficult jumps and complicated programs 
and expects his students to learn quickly and to perform accurately. 
</P>
<P>
"He has helped me so much," Ng said. "He's a great coach, and I don't think 
that I could find anyone better.' 
</P>
<P>
Ng maintains a straight-A average and also plays the piano. "I like to do a lot 
of different things," Ng said. "Of course I love skating the most, but I also 
like dancing, piano, painting shirts and skiing. I like everything, actually. 
I'm just a happy kid." 
</P>
<P>
Ng stands 4-foot-10 and weighs a mere 70 pounds, but she is a powerful 
performer on the ice. "There are some things you cannot teach, like the 
relationship between the audience and the skater," Carroll said. "She is so 
bubbly, so up all the time that they just adore her. 
</P>
<P>
"You can never make predictions about skating. Look what happened to Tiffany 
Chin. But as far as having the equipment necessary to be a world champion, she 
has it."
