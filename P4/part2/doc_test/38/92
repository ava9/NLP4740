Hansjoerg Tauscher of West Germany, a non-winner in three seasons on the World 
Cup circuit, won the gold medal in the weather-delayed men's downhill today at 
the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Tauscher, 21, continuing a tradition of unexpected finishes in World 
Championship competition, was timed in 2 minutes, 10.39 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Switzerland's Peter Mueller, the defending world champion in the downhill and a 
favorite in this race, finished 19-hundredths of a second back at 2:10.58 to 
take the silver medal, and Swiss teammate Karl Alpiger won the bronze in 
2:10.67. 
</P>
<P>
Swiss skiers claimed the next two places as well, with Daniel Mahrer finishing 
fourth in 2:10.91 and William Besse fifth in 2:10.94. 
</P>
<P>
Two other favorites, Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg and Pirmin Zurbriggen of 
Switzerland, finished out of the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Tauscher's best previous finish in a World Cup race was fifth in a downhill at 
Laax, Switzerland, on Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
No one expected Tauscher's gold-medal breakthrough today. He had finished no 
higher than sixth in any of the four training runs. 
</P>
<P>
The race, originally scheduled for Saturday, was postponed when three feet of 
snow inundated Beaver Creek. Earlier, high winds interrupted training and 
contributed to a crash by Zurbriggen, leaving him with a bruised upper back and 
bruised ribs. 
</P>
<P>
Crews managed to clear the course of most of the fresh snow, but today's 
winning time was about two seconds slower than early training times on a 
harder, icier surface. 
</P>
<P>
Mahrer, with what was considered a disadvantageous start number (2) because 
early racers had to plow through more loose snow, posted a quick time that 
stood up until Tauscher, with bib No. 9, came down. 
</P>
<P>
Tauscher was a full second behind Mahrer at the second intermediate clocking 
but had narrowed the gap to two-hundredths at the fourth intermediate, then 
made up the difference on the bottom part, which featured numerous bumps and 
rolls and some tight turns. 
</P>
<P>
Mueller, running 11th, and Zurbriggen, starting 15th, could not catch him, 
although Mueller was slightly faster through the fourth intermediate clocking. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficially, Norway's Atle Skaardal placed sixth in 2:10.99, followed by three 
Austrians: Helmut Hoeflehner in 2:11.24, Peter Wirnsberger in 2:11.52 and Roman 
Rupp in 2:11.60.
