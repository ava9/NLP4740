ONE of the fruits of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(Nasa) programme in the 1960s was that it spawned a new generation of
innovative electronics companies.
One is SCI, founded in Alabama by Olin B King, a former Nasa engineer who
began a three-man business manufacturing flight simulators for the moon
shots in his basement in 1961.
King realised, however, that there was not much volume in 18 moon shots. So
he diversified the company, initially called Space Craft Inc., into building
a wide range of electronic systems under contract.
By 1969, when the Apollo launch vehicle left the Kennedy Space centre launch
pad, it was carrying more than 400 SCI-built sub-systems providing vital
instrumentation, communication and computer functions, including some in the
lunar lander.
Eight years later, in August 1977, SCI built the plated-wire memories for
the highly successful Voyager 2 spacecraft whose systems were still
operating flawlessly more than a decade later.
When the original IBM PC made its appearance in 1981 it came with a
SCI-manufactured motherboard. SCI also manufactured the Sinclair-designed
Z88 computer.
By the mid 1980s SCI had become a Fortune 500 company in its own right.
Today it is one of the biggest and oldest contract electronics manufacturers
employing about 9,500 people in 19 manufacturing plants worldwide, and
serving mainly multinational customers in North America, Western Europe and
South East Asia where it has plants in Singapore and Thailand. Last year,
the publicly-quoted group, which is still based at Huntsville, reported net
income of Dollars 3.83m on revenues of Dollars 1.05bn despite the recession.
SCI's major worldwide IT customers in the year to June 30 last year included
IBM, Seagate Technology and Conner Peripherals, which together accounted for
almost half its total revenues. However, SCI is now a major diversified
manufacturer for both the Government and commercial markets. It designs,
manufactures, markets and services electronic products for OEM (original
equipment manufacturers) customers in many industries including the
aerospace, telecommunications, medical and banking sectors.
Its investment in electronics manufacturing technology is enormous. Overall
the group, which began to install surface mount technology (SMT) production
lines in 1985, had 75 fully automated SMT assembly lines in operation by mid
1992 together with 34 traditional lines using the older PTH
(plated-through-hole) technology.
The group is divided into five geographic regions each with multiple plants
manufacturing components, sub-assemblies and finished products for
customers, but also increasingly offering a full 'turnkey' option including
design, engineering, purchasing, manufacturing, distribution and support
services if required.
The growth of SCI's international operations, including those in Europe,
directly reflects the increasing globalisation of the world electronics
industry. SCI followed its OEM customers overseas in order to maintain its
global manufacturing relationships.
For example, SCI's European region comprises two manufacturing facilities,
one in Irvine, Scotland, and the other in Fermoy, County Cork,in the Irish
Republic.
Both sites reflect the establishment of significant offshore manufacturing
bases by global OEMs over the past decade. In Scotland, SCI followed
customers such as IBM, Sun Micro systems and Mitsubishi which needed to
establish operations in Europe and were attracted to the region by a range
of incentives.
Similarly the Fermoy plant, which employs 300 people, was set up in 1989 to
provide electronic assemblies to Irish manufacturing operations of
multinational OEMs such as Dell Computer which set up operations in Ireland
as part of their global manufacturing strategies.
'They all want to manufacture close to the market because it gives
flexibility,' says Mr Bruce Armstrong, SCI senior vice president in charge
of the European division.
SCI's size and dispersed operations are a significant advantage when dealing
with large multinational OEMs because it can offer customers considerable
flexibility. If a customer's market or manufacturing need changes by
location or demand, production can be switched to any SCI plant in a matter
of days.
For example, a complete new SMT line can be flown in from Huntsville and,
says Armstrong, 'be up and running within two weeks'. Because modern
contract manufacturing is capital intensive the cost differential between
different regions is not usually significant. 'These days the cost is a
given, but it is flexibility that counts,' when it comes to holding on to
customers, he says.
Nevertheless he accepts that the European plants have to be able to match
the Far East on the basis of 'landed' or total contract price - including
those costs which are often overlooked such as transport, inventory and
other less tangible items such as delays and inflexibility.
It is a measure of the success at Irvine in controlling overheads and other
costs while providing flexibility that it has recently succeeded in winning
some contracts back from the Far East.
The 120,000 sq ft Scottish plant was set up in 1984, mainly to supply IBM's
Greenock PC operations. Today it employs about 800 people although, like
most other large contract electronics manufacturers, SCI also uses a pool of
casual labour and the workforce is expanded by several hundred temporary
workers at busy times.
Equipment at Irvine includes 12 Fuji SMT lines, each costing about Dollars
1m, four Universal PTH lines and three system configuration lines. Currently
80 per cent of output is SMT, 15 per cent PTH and 5 per cent even newer
technologies such as COB (chip on board). But by the turn of the century Mr
Armstrong expects the proportions to be 75 per cent, 10 per cent and 15 per
cent respectively.
The product mix is also changing. Five years ago 90 per cent of production
was for the IT industry. However the plant has broadened its customer base.
IT now represents about 70 per cent, telecommunications 20 per cent and
automotive 10 per cent with telecoms and the automotive sectors growing
rapidly.
SCI has also expanded its range of services and increasingly sees itself as
being in a beneficial partnership with its customers. Some customers still
only require a consignment manufacturing service - they supply all the
materials. However, Mr Armstrong says the 'more enlightened' OEMs have long
since moved towards much broader 'turnkey' contracts where services can
range from product engineering and design for manufacturing, through
procurement, manufacturing and testing to distribution.
SCI designs and manufactures some products completely. For example, it
designs and builds its own PCs, which are then badged by two big computer
companies. Mr Armstrong acknowledges that there is some temptation for SCI
to widen its business and sell products under its own name. However, he
adds, 'in the end it's about doing what you are good at'. And for SCI that
is being expert at capital intensive, high technology, flexible contract
manufacturing.
In order to maximise flexibility while minimising costs SCI uses automated
manufacturing systems and electronic data interchange (EDI) to provide
sophisticated links with its customers and suppliers and to interconnect its
own plants.
'The reason we are efficient is that each plant is a profit and loss centre.
They have to make a profit,' says Mr Armstrong. The two European plants
export 50 per cent of their production to continental Europe, and the
percentage is rising so SCI is likely to build a new plant in Europe soon,
probably in France.
When any of its plants reaches full capacity SCI builds another rather than
expanding existing facilities. This is because it believes that overheads
increase quickly when a plant becomes too large. 'Otherwise you become an
OEM,' says Mr Armstrong. 'In our business small and medium is beautiful.'
