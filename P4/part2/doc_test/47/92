James C. Fletcher, who returned to the helm of the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration during its darkest hours, announced his resignation 
Tuesday, effective April 8. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, 69, who had served as NASA administrator from April of 1971 to May of 
1977, reluctantly accepted the post in 1986 for a second time in the aftermath 
of the Challenger explosion, the nation's worst space disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation came as no surprise in that Fletcher had made it clear that he 
wanted to retire as soon as President Bush named a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Sources at NASA said they thought Fletcher went ahead and announced his 
decision before the replacement was picked in hopes of accelerating the 
process. Many in NASA are extremely anxious over who will head the agency 
because the appointment could serve as an indication of how strongly the Bush 
Administration will push space exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Selection of a strong leader who would be willing to do battle with Congress in 
these days of budgetary limitations would indicate that the Administration 
plans to aggressively pursue the many items on the agency's agenda, including 
the construction of a permanently manned space station by the end of the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Fletcher is seen as having been a strong administrator but an 
uninspiring leader in the three years of his current term as head of the 
embattled agency. He is credited with completing a major overhaul of NASA's top 
management structure, getting the authorization and money to build a 
replacement for the Challenger and keeping the space station alive. 
</P>
<P>
NASA's deputy administrator, Dale Myers, will serve as acting administrator 
until Fletcher's successor is picked.
