Landing on the moon was child's play as astronaut Michael Collins led 
schoolchildren on a simulated space trip, commemorating the 20th anniversary of 
man's first steps on the lunar surface. Collins and students from Prince 
George's County, Md., schools were linked by television satellite to a mock-up 
mission control manned by astronaut Charles Duke and students at the Houston 
Museum of Natural History in Texas. Duke was the "capcom," or capsule 
communicator, when Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin Jr. set foot on 
the moon July 20, 1969. Collins, the Apollo 11 command module pilot, orbited 
the moon while his crew mates romped on the lunar surface. During the 
simulation at a high-tech science education center in Greenbelt, Md., Collins 
and the students used computers to gather moon rocks, build and launch a space 
probe, analyze lunar samples, monitor life support systems and operate robots 
and lunar rovers. "They had a good landing. They're a team of real 
professionals," Collins said of the students. "We're ready to hire them."

 -- This time it's personal for Richard M. Nixon. For the first time, the 
former President will describe in detail his experiences in resigning the 
presidency and his life in retirement in an autobiography due next spring. "It 
is the most personal book I have ever written," Nixon, 76, said in a statement. 
Simon &amp; Schuster, the publisher, would not disclose terms of the contract 
but said it plans a first printing of at least 200,000 and a major marketing 
campaign. Nixon has pledged his income from the book to the Nixon Library and 
Birthplace, scheduled to open next year at Yorba Linda, Calif.

 -- Seventy years after the death of Nicholas II, about 200 people gathered in 
a monastery graveyard in Moscow to hold the first public Requiem in the Soviet 
Union for the czar who was shot, along with his family, by Bolshevik guards in 
July, 1918. Worshipers defied repeated orders by police to leave the prayer 
meeting conducted by Russian Orthodox priests at Donskoi Monastery. The 
unofficial Commission on the Remains of the Russian Imperial is calling for the 
remains of the royal family to be given Christian burials in the Peter and Paul 
Fortress in Leningrad, traditional resting place for Romanov royalty, Vladimir 
Anishchenko, a commission member, said. Monarchists have contacted Grand Prince 
Vladimir Kirillovich, ranking member of the Romanov family, who lives in 
England. "He just came back to life when he heard about our activity," 
Anishchenko said. SHIRLEY MARLOW
