Neil A. Armstrong, who walked into history 20 years ago July as the first man 
on the moon, made a rare public appearance today with his two Apollo 11 crew 
mates and endorsed NASA's planned space station. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference to commemorate the 20th anniversary of their historic 
flight, Armstrong, 58, Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin, 59, and Michael Collins, 58, 
reminisced about their July 16, 1969, blastoff atop a mighty Saturn 5 rocket 
and the mission that fulfilled President John F. Kennedy's promise to land men 
on the moon before the end of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, I did make a statement endorsing the concept of a permanent 
presence in space," Armstrong said. "I guess I still feel that's a worthy 
objective. I hope that space station Freedom becomes a reality before we have 
another 10 years go by." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong was referring to NASA's plans to build a permanently manned space 
station in the late 1990s, a project that is threatened by budget cuts and a 
lack of political support. 
</P>

<P>
Mars Mission Endorsed 
</P>
<P>
Aldrin called for an evolutionary approach to exploring the solar system while 
Collins strongly endorsed a mission to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this country should set a goal of exploring and setting up on Mars," 
Collins said. "That is the one goal that . . . I think would have a unifying 
and perhaps even an electrifying effect on NASA and our space program." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong and Aldrin touched down in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20, 1969, 
in a spider-like lunar module spacecraft called Eagle while Collins orbited 69 
miles overhead in the gumdrop-shaped Apollo command module, Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind," Armstrong said as 
he stepped onto the moon's surface. 
</P>
<P>
While Aldrin and Collins have granted interviews and written books, Armstrong, 
a very private man, has routinely refused to meet the press or make public 
appearances.
