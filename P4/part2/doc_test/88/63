OLIVIER, CALLED GREATEST ACTOR OF HIS TIME, DIES; 
</P>
<P>
ROLES RANGING FROM HEATHCLIFF TO LEAR BROUGHT WORLD FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Laurence Olivier, whose prowess in roles ranging from Heathcliff to King Lear 
brought him wide acclaim as the greatest actor of his time -- and made him the 
first to be raised to the British peerage -- died Tuesday at his home in 
England. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier, holder of three Academy Awards and four Emmys, had battled cancer, 
pleurisy and a muscle disease in recent years but did not announce his 
retirement until 1987. Even afterward, he continued to take on cameo roles. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate announcement of the cause of death. "His last few days 
were very peaceful. He died in his sleep at noon. All the family were at his 
side," said Richard Olivier, the 27-year-old son of his third marriage, to 
actress Joan Plowright. 
</P>
<P>
In Britain, the death of a national institution was marked as theaters from the 
West End to Stratford dimmed their lights and lowered flags to half-staff. 
Queen Elizabeth II sent condolences to Olivier's family at his home near 
Ashurst, a village in West Sussex about 50 miles south of London. 
</P>
<P>
Across the Atlantic, Broadway theaters also dimmed their marquee lights in 
tribute Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't too much to say that Olivier was perhaps the greatest man of the 
theater ever," said Sir Peter Hall, head of the National Theater, which Olivier 
helped to found. "Larry Olivier's genius shaped the last 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
A private funeral is planned, with a public memorial service in London later. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier was the quintessential actor, as famous for his stage work as for his 
films and for the vividness of his private life. He was, by turns: 
</P>
<P>
* The most pride-driven Heathcliff. 
</P>
<P>
* The most tortured Hamlet. 
</P>
<P>
* The most heroic Henry V. 
</P>
<P>
* The most perfidious Richard III. 
</P>
<P>
* The most tragically vain and foolish Lear. 
</P>
<P>
He was all these and more than 100 others in the course of a career that also 
included successful efforts as director and producer of plays and films, the 
rebuilding of the Old Vic Theater Company after World War II and leadership in 
creating the British National Theater. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turbulent Marriage 
</P>
<P>
He drew a different sort of attention for his ultimately disastrous romance 
with actress Vivien Leigh, whom he married in 1940, shortly after she 
catapulted to fame as Scarlett O'Hara in "Gone With the Wind." The turbulent 
marriage -- Olivier's second -- lasted two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier was the kind of performer for whom superlatives are invented . . . and 
discarded. 
</P>
<P>
He was renowned for his daring -- taking dangerous leaps about the stage and 
bold interpretations of character. "However many times you'd seen him, it was 
probably the most dangerously thrilling moment you'd seen on any stage," actor 
Jeremy Brett said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there was always at the core a sense of fun -- and of proportion to Sir 
Laurence, Baron of Brighton. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm too much of an urchin not to smile slightly at the idea of being a lord," 
he said in accepting the honor. "But this peerage confers official dignity on 
the acting profession." 
</P>
<P>
When Michael Caine dutifully and nervously greeted him as Sir Laurence at their 
first meeting during the production of "Sleuth," Olivier said, "That's fine, 
and now call me Larry, please." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sure Sense of Worth 
</P>
<P>
And while maintaining a sure sense of his own worth ("Don't tell me whether I 
was good or bad in a part -- I damn well know which it was, and I'll know it 
before anyone else") there was also a refusal to see himself, or his 
profession, as the center of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
"When you think about it," he said in a 1980 interview, "what is acting but 
lying? When I was small I lied all the time. . . . I like to think I was just 
practicing my profession. But really I was just being a bloody liar." 
</P>
<P>
It was a typical childhood memory for Olivier, who recalled that part of his 
life as a "mitigated horror, based mostly on being afraid of my father." 
</P>
<P>
Laurence Kerr Olivier was born May 22, 1907, in Dorking, Surrey, England. He 
was the third child and second son of the Rev. Gerard Kerr Olivier, an 
Anglo-Catholic clergyman who preached with a theatrical flair that the actor 
later credited with helping to decide the course of his life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sister's Description 
</P>
<P>
Olivier's sister, Sybille, described the parson's wrath as "a storming, raging 
tornado which he'd turn on Larry in a way he never did on our brother Dickie 
and me." 
</P>
<P>
But the situation was, as Olivier said, mitigated; his mother, Agnes Crookenden 
Olivier, became the center of his childish world. It was her sense of joy and 
gift of laughter that he said later enabled him to find elements of humor even 
in so tragic a figure as King Lear. 
</P>
<P>
Though he recalled beginning his acting career on a stage he had made from a 
packing crate when he was 5 years old, Olivier said his first real training 
came at a 14-pupil choir school affiliated with the Church of All Saints in 
London, where he came under the influence of Geoffrey Heald, a priest devoted 
to the theater who directed plays as well as conducting the choir. 
</P>
<P>
He played several parts in Heald's plays, but it was his characterization of 
Brutus in "Julius Caesar" that caused one member of the audience -- actress 
Ellen Terry -- to write in her diary, "The small boy who played Brutus is 
already a great actor." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Serious Thought 
</P>
<P>
All the same, Olivier said he gave no serious thought to an acting career. He 
expected his father to order him into the ministry. 
</P>
<P>
But here, his father surprised him. 
</P>
<P>
Confronted by young Laurence's halfhearted plea that he be permitted to follow 
his brother to India, the elder Olivier drew himself up to his full height, 
snorted, and roared: 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be an ass! You're going on the stage." 
</P>
<P>
Thunderstruck and overjoyed, Olivier recalled, he applied forthwith for a 
scholarship ("It had to be that; the Olivier family's poverty was genteel, but 
very real") to the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art. 
</P>
<P>
There, he said, famed dramatic teacher Elsie Fogerty criticized his hairline, 
gait, eye position, nose, chin, posture, speech, gestures and intentions -- but 
granted him, in addition to full tuition for a year, a small stipend to meet 
living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Between terms, he worked as a stage manager and general understudy at the St. 
Christopher Theater in Lechworth, where he made his professional acting debut 
as Lennox in "Macbeth" during Easter holidays in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
On graduating, he was presented a cup as best actor in the school. But neither 
the cup nor the professional debut seemed to carry much weight when he emerged 
for his first season -- and began to pay the dues the English theater 
traditionally exacts from beginners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gained Bit Parts 
</P>
<P>
From walk-ons he progressed to bit parts in the provinces and then a minor role 
in an experimental play in London. 
</P>
<P>
His performance as Malcolm in a modern-dress version of "Macbeth" earned 
Olivier his first real notice, and he followed with the lead in Tennyson's 
verse drama "Harold" and other roles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
String of Disasters 
</P>
<P>
Olivier's first lead part in a major production was "Beau Geste." It closed in 
disaster, and so did the next five plays in which he appeared. 
</P>
<P>
"So you can imagine my frame of mind when a relative unknown, Noel Coward, came 
to me with a proposal that I join him and Gertrude Lawrence in something he'd 
written called 'Private Lives.' 
</P>
<P>
"I turned him down flat!" 
</P>
<P>
However, Coward proved as good a salesman as he was an actor and playwright. A 
day of practically nonstop argument finally persuaded Olivier to change his 
mind. "Private Lives" opened in London to rave reviews, set box office records, 
and continued its winning ways when it was transplanted to New York. 
</P>
<P>
More success was to come in "Rats of Norway," "The Green Bay Tree" and "Queen 
of Scots," among others. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the fall of 1935, "Romeo and Juliet" opened with Olivier in the lead 
and John Gielgud playing Mercutio. After seven weeks, they switched parts -- 
and kept switching back and forth to critical hosannas for the rest of the 
six-month run. 
</P>
<P>
"Overnight," Olivier said, "people could remember my name. They even began to 
ask for my autograph. It scared me half to death." 
</P>
<P>
It also, he said later, began to change the way he viewed his chosen 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decided to Restart 
</P>
<P>
"I decided," he said, "to start life all over again -- and learn to act." 
</P>
<P>
He joined England's famed Old Vic Company and began restudying the classics. 
</P>
<P>
His first Old Vic role, "Hamlet" in 1937, startled critics and audiences alike 
with its power, and he followed with similarly effective portrayals of "Henry 
V" and "Macbeth" plus Sir Toby Belch in "Twelfth Night" and Iago in "Othello." 
</P>
<P>
"In Othello," he said, "I had come to the conclusion that Iago had a homosexual 
attraction to Othello. It explained a lot of his motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"So, to demonstrate, during a rehearsal I turned and kissed Ralph Richardson -- 
he was playing the Moor -- full on the lips. You should have seen his reaction! 
</P>
<P>
" 'There, there, my dear boy,' he said. 'Steady, now. Steady!' " 
</P>
<P>
He was, he said, well pleased with this "second start" for his life, and might 
very well simply have continued along the classical line on stage but for one 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I discovered the movies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, he had discovered them a long time before -- in 1927, when he made 
his film debut for Paramount in "Too Many Crooks" -- but until 1939 he 
considered them merely a way to make enough money to live well while pursuing 
"important" work on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"I was frightfully snobbish," he said. "And whereas it didn't seem to matter 
much in films like 'Perfect Understanding' and 'No Funny Business,' and 'The 
Divorce of Lady X,' all of which I made during the '30s, that attitude almost 
ruined me in 'Wuthering Heights.' " 
</P>
<P>
William Wyler, directing the film, was deeply depressed by early scenes, and 
there was even talk of shutting down production to recast the role. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feeling Superior 
</P>
<P>
"But Wyler took me in hand and made me look at what I was doing," Olivier said. 
"I could see it, up there on the screen. I was feeling superior to the medium 
-- and it was making me inferior." 
</P>
<P>
Olivier returned to the sound stages for retakes and began to listen to Wyler's 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
The result was his first nomination for an Academy Award. 
</P>
<P>
"Not to mention a whole new appreciation of the possibilities of film as an art 
form, something I had never considered before. I began to wonder about doing 
Shakespeare on film. It had been tried before -- with disastrous results. But 
still. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Other events, however, postponed Olivier's planning. 
</P>
<P>
One interruption was his first divorce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Married to Actress 
</P>
<P>
He had been married for 10 years to actress Jill Esmond; they had one son, 
Simon Tarquin. And now the marriage was over. Press and public made the usual 
noises of condolence and vague disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
But the noises built to a crescendo a few days later when he was married to 
Leigh. 
</P>
<P>
The fame of the couple (Olivier had picked up a second Oscar nomination for his 
performance in "Rebecca") and their personal attractiveness were more than 
sufficient for millions upon millions of printed and spoken words. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have thought they had better things to write about, that year," Olivier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"That year" was 1940, and one of the things Olivier, personally, was thinking 
about was his homeland, where World War II had taken a nearly catastrophic 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Goes Home to Fight 
</P>
<P>
Olivier lingered in the United States long enough to appear with Katharine 
Cornell in the critically acclaimed "No Time for Comedy" and with his new wife 
in a critically deplored "Romeo and Juliet," and then went home to fight. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier was commissioned and designated a second-line pilot in the Fleet Air 
Arm, but he was denied any combat role -- and so was amenable when it was 
suggested that he make radio broadcasts and films boosting morale and enlisting 
worldwide sympathy for the Allied cause. 
</P>
<P>
And then came "Henry V." 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted," he said "to speak of British determination and heroes. Henry V 
seemed the best answer. But, how to get it onto film? Shakespeare had, thus 
far, defied all efforts at film translation." 
</P>
<P>
The answer was a classic. Olivier's solution to the problem of easing an 
audience into the rhythms of Shakespeare was to start the film on an 
Elizabethan stage, as though it were actually a performance at the Globe 
Theater -- but to then move to full movie treatment and freedom for most of the 
play, not returning to the "reality" of the stage until the final curtain 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Memorable Scene 
</P>
<P>
This afforded the opportunity, among other things, to show combat on horseback 
rather than afoot as in stage productions, and gave Olivier one of his more 
memorable scenes. 
</P>
<P>
"Once more into the breach!" the king exhorts his men, waving his sword from 
the back of a gray gelding known as Blaunchkyng: "Cry, 'God for Harry, England 
and St. Geo-o-o-o-rge!' " The slightly nasal voice slides up the scale of pitch 
and power as horse and man leap forward. 
</P>
<P>
"A nice touch, that," Olivier mused in later years. "All Shakespeare's, of 
course; not mine. Still -- I think he might have approved." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the public did. 
</P>
<P>
The film is still being shown around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences liked it, too, and voted him a 
special Oscar for his "outstanding achievement as actor, producer and director" 
of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier followed, in 1948, with "Hamlet," which landed him his second Oscar as 
best actor. (The film, which he produced, also won an Oscar as best of the 
year.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Returns to Stage 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he had returned to the stage. In 1944, the Old Vic Company, nearly 
dismantled and bankrupted by the war, had named him co-director. He got the 
company moving again, appearing as Button Moulder in Peer Gynt, followed by 
Sergius Saranoff in "Arms and the Man," and the duke of Gloucester in "Richard 
III." 
</P>
<P>
He was also Astrov in "Uncle Vanya," Hotspur in "Henry IV, Part I," and Justice 
Shallow in "Henry IV, Part II," as well as appearing in the title role of 
"Oedipus," which he presented on a double bill with his portrayal of Puff in 
"The Critic." 
</P>
<P>
Later, in his autobiography, Olivier gave insight into his acting methods by 
disclosing what was on his mind while he delivered Oedipus' terrible scream at 
the moment of his blinding: ermine. The trappers trick these precious animals 
by putting salt on the ice; the ermine lick the salt and their tongues become 
frozen to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
It was an exhausting schedule and raised the company to a new peak of 
popularity and prestige, but in 1949 he moved on, leaving to stage a London 
production of Tennessee Williams' "A Streetcar Named Desire," with Leigh in the 
role of Blanche du Bois. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier's long-simmering ambition to be an actor-manager in the grand tradition 
was fulfilled between 1950-57 by his introduction to London audiences of 
Christopher Fry's elegant verse comedy, "Venus Observed," Gian Carlo Menotti's 
opera "The Consul," and Australian playwright Ray Lawler's drama "Summer of the 
Seventeenth Doll." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Festival of Britain 
</P>
<P>
He also appeared with Leigh in "Caesar and Cleopatra," and "Antony and 
Cleopatra," performing the plays on alternating nights during the Festival of 
Britain and later transferring both to the Ziegfeld Theater in New York, where 
the couple also appeared in Terence Rattigan's "The Sleeping Prince." 
</P>
<P>
Returning to England, the Oliviers appeared in three more Shakespearean 
productions. But Olivier was restless and in 1957 left the classics for a time 
to create the tragic and self-centered character of Archie Rice in "The 
Entertainer," John Osborne's scalding repudiation of the social order. It was a 
daring alliance between England's leading actor and one of the country's new 
breed of "angry young men" playwrights. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier remained active in films in this period -- notably when he returned 
Shakespeare to the screen in 1956 with his sneering, malevolent -- and oddly 
attractive -- "Richard III. It was almost as well received as "Henry V" and 
"Hamlet." 
</P>
<P>
"The Prince and the Showgirl," (a screen version of "Sleeping Prince,") which 
paired him with Marilyn Monroe the following year, was a critical catastrophe 
-- though Olivier always thought the reaction somewhat unjust. 
</P>
<P>
"A fair person, looking at the performance and disregarding the personal lives 
of the players, would see it for what it was -- a competent performance by 
professionals. The trouble was, no one looked at it that way." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring not only to Monroe's problems, but to his own as well. 
</P>
<P>
The marriage to Leigh, tempestuous from the outset, had become increasingly 
unsettled with the passing years, and by the late 1950s their troubles were 
beginning to appear in print. Leigh, tiring of the marriage, had affairs with 
actor Peter Finch and others and was eventually diagnosed as suffering from 
manic depression. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Olivier refused to comment publicly. But later, after her death, 
he tried to explain. 
</P>
<P>
"You can reach a point," he told an interviewer in 1979, "where it's like a 
life raft that can only hold so many. You cast away the hand grasping it. You 
do not take it on board because otherwise, it's both of you. Two, instead of 
one." 
</P>
<P>
It was, he said, "more than my life -- I was afraid of killing her." 
</P>
<P>
"I nearly did, once. She was slapping me across the face with wet flannels . . 
. until I went into my room and closed the door. She kept beating on the door . 
. . until I couldn't take it any more. 
</P>
<P>
"I came out and grabbed her and threw her across the room. . . . I knew then it 
had ended. I had to get out." 
</P>
<P>
And so, in 1960, the Oliviers were divorced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tells of His Fear 
</P>
<P>
His remarriage the following year -- to a much younger actress, Joan Plowright, 
was by all accounts his happiest. The couple had three children -- son Richard 
and daughters Tamsin and Julia Kate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Continued to Star 
</P>
<P>
On stage, he continued to play starring roles: Berenger in Ionesco's 
"Rhinoceros," in 1960, and both leads, at times, in Anouilh's "Becket" in New 
York and on the road the same year. 
</P>
<P>
On film, however, Olivier seemed to slip gradually toward the character and 
cameo appearance bracket with small, although highly praised, characterizations 
in "The Devil's Disciple" and "Spartacus." 
</P>
<P>
A return to top billing in a film version of "The Entertainer" brought mixed 
reviews, and a poor box office return -- and seemed to lead to a three-year 
hiatus, in which he abandoned films entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was more a problem of timing. "There are," he said, "only 24 hours 
in most days, and I have simply got to sleep through at least five or six of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Directed Three Plays 
</P>
<P>
He had accepted the stewardship of the Chichester Festival Theater, England's 
first arena-type auditorium, in 1961, and directed three plays for the 
inaugural program in the summer of 1962 (playing a major role in one) and then 
returned to the commercial stage for the satirical comedy "Semi-Detached" in 
London before accepting the managing directorship of the new National Theater 
of Great Britain in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Though he continued as director of the Chichester until 1965, most of his 
energies were absorbed by the task of creating the National Theater -- acting 
as administrator as well as director and performer. 
</P>
<P>
His efforts were, ultimately, successful; when he finally relinquished the 
reins of the theater in 1973, his decade of management had seen the 
organization firmly established -- a highly respected and acclaimed national 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there were those who shook their heads, lamenting his expenditure of time 
and energy in the minutiae of theatrical management. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Director's Comment 
</P>
<P>
"No one," said director Tony Richardson, "should allow Larry to do anything but 
act. Few, if any, can do that so well." 
</P>
<P>
There was also a suspicion that exhaustion connected with the National Theater 
(he supervised, directed and appeared in such productions as "Othello," "The 
Merchant of Venice," "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and "The Three Sisters") 
was responsible for a series of illnesses that began to plague him during the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
They included cancer of the prostate, and thrombosis that, he said, swelled his 
right leg until it weighed 20 pounds more than the left, and an ailment called 
dermo-myositis, a wasting inflammation of the muscles that also renders the 
skin extremely sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
In his autobiography, "Confessions of an Actor," published in 1982, Olivier 
revealed how he also battled overpowering stage fright in the 1960s. During a 
run of "Othello" he was so terrified of reciting his soliloquies that he asked 
another actor to stand off stage to provide reassurance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Ailments, Too 
</P>
<P>
He struggled through it all ("I also had appendicitis, bronchial pneumonia and 
a couple of other little things -- enough to keep one interested"), directing 
and acting mainly for the National until 1974 and then simply "retired" from 
the theater. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was a matter of physical inability. 
</P>
<P>
"I can no longer be a stage actor," he told an interviewer in 1979, "because I 
don't feel I've got the power, the physical attributes that are absolutely 
necessary to be a very good, powerful, meaningful actor. 
</P>
<P>
"So, we have the movies. Thank God for the movies." 
</P>
<P>
His performance as the mercurial Andrew Wyke in the hit movie "Sleuth" in 1972 
had fully re-established his film career. 
</P>
<P>
"Sleuth" won him another Oscar nomination as well as the New York Film Critics' 
best-actor designation. Another Academy Award nomination came in 1976 for his 
evocation of the coldly evil dentist-torturer of "Marathon Man," and yet 
another for his characterization of a relentless tracker of German war 
criminals in "The Boys from Brazil" in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, there had been other changes in his life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Became a Knight 
</P>
<P>
He had become Sir Laurence Olivier in 1947, the youngest of his profession ever 
to receive such an honor. But other actors had achieved knighthood. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier's honor was unique among actors, however, when Queen Elizabeth II 
created him a life peer -- Baron Olivier of Brighton -- as a reward for his 
"services to the theater" in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a third Oscar (a special one, presented in 1979 for "the full 
body of his work"), Olivier received a gold medallion from the Swedish Academy 
of Literature, was an officer of the French Legion of Honor, held honorary 
degrees from Oxford and Edinburgh universities and three Emmy awards for 
television appearances in "The Moon and Sixpence," "Long Day's Journey Into 
Night" and "Love Among the Ruins." 
</P>
<P>
More recently he played the small but powerful role of Lord Marchmain in 
"Brideshead Revisited," which brought him his fourth Emmy. 
</P>
<P>
There were also appearances in less laudable efforts: he was Gen. Douglas 
MacArthur in the disastrous "Inchon" and Van Helsing in "Dracula." 
</P>
<P>
This was balanced by his astonishing "King Lear" in which the aged actor 
carried off one of Shakespeare's most physically demanding roles with flawless 
excellence. Another man -- a lesser one, perhaps -- might have called it a day 
then, content to exit on a rising note. But Olivier carried on: "Lear" was 
closely followed by "The Ebony Tower," a television version of John Fowles' 
novel filmed mainly in France. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 he had a small role in the British mini-series "Lost Empires" and 
published a second volume of autobiography, "On Acting. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last year, he played a wheelchair-bound general in the British 
film "War Requiem." Numerous tributes marked Olivier's 80th birthday two years 
ago, including a retrospective of his major films, the issuance of two birthday 
books, and special radio and television broadcasts.

Earlier this year, he made his last public performance, a tape-recorded appeal 
to preserve the remains of London's Rose Theater, where Shakespeare is believed 
to have acted, which had been unearthed during construction of an office block.

In his later years, he was asked by an interviewer why, considering the 
precarious state of his health, he continued a strenuous work schedule. Olivier 
smiled wryly.

<P>
"Well, it won't do any more to say it's because I need the money for Joan and 
the kids, will it? 
</P>
<P>
"I mean -- they're grown, aren't they? The truth is, if I stopped work, I 
wouldn't know what to do. Can't imagine retiring -- puttering about the garden, 
that sort of thing. 
</P>
<P>
"No, no. I'll tell you, I've always fancied making what you might call my final 
exit while working -- at full cry. Something like a final 'Once more into the 
breach . . . ' you know? 
</P>
<P>
"Now, that would be fine -- really fine."
