given its first London showing on Thursday night at Sadler's Wells - Kim
Brandstrup identifies what led him to make this danced version of Hamlet.
Not narrative, but 'what lies behind the words'. This has also been
Brandstrup's concern in such significant pieces as his Peer Gynt and The
Dybbuk, and may be understood in Mysteries, his commentary on Duke
Bluebeard's Castle.
Brandstrup's vision is refined, potent. His theatre is - thanks in part to
what Karsavina called 'blessed poverty' - one where every effect is reduced
to its mechanical or physical essence, and, like the dance, resonates with
meaning. This is what I find so convincing about his work, and it is what
makes Antic fascinating and powerful. As with Noh, or with the theatre
dreamed of by Edward Gordon Craig, we enter a world of allusions, symbols.
Appearances are essences; less is superbly more. And in Antic - as with his
exquisite Orfeo for London Contemporary Dance - Brandstrup has looked to an
earlier theatre form as frame for his choreography. (And he has been joined
by the same magnificent Orfeo collaborators: Craig Givens for design; Ian
Dearden for score; Tina MacHugh for lighting, who share Brandstrup's
imaginative subtlety and economy).
Antic owes certain of its attitudes to the 17th century Trauerspiel of
Northern Europe, a melange of sentiment and melodrama. Craig Givens sets the
stage with grand simplicity by means of panels of almost spectral tapestry,
with chairs, a table, the only properties. Costuming is of the period,
sombre save for warm earthy shades for three actors in the play scene. The
'look' is austere, very beautiful. And Tina MacHugh lights this world with
ideal sensitivity to every dramatic point. Ian Dearden's score mixes
electronic and instrumental sound to provide music both atmospheric and
sustaining of the action. Like the choreography, it adjusts exactly to the
idea of a baroque style re-cast for today.
The choreography is that subtext Branstrup has discerned behind
Shakespeare's words. Passions, motives, emotional unease, are exposed in
dancing that is impressive in its perceptions as in its ability to explore
feeling. We may identify incident and characterisation from the play - the
closet scene; Polonius' death; Ophelia's madness - but more significantly,
we are taken into the minds or memories of the characters, and see how
obsessions repeat, how psychic wounds remain open, how Hamlet's sufferings
hedge him in.
Images are everywhere sure, vivid: the mad Ophelia moving from one frozen
pose to another; Hamlet circling the stage in a swirl of action that tells
of his indecisions; Claudius arranging the seated Gertrude in a pose, as he
has earlier placed Ophelia; Hamlet, at the last, held like a child on the
shoulders of his ghost Father. Branstrup's theatre is compact of such
memorable dynamics and such visual coups.
There are excellent performances from the ten members of Arc Dance: Jeremy
James as Hamlet; Mark Ashman and Souli Yates as Claudius and Gertrude;
Joanna O'Keeffe as Ophelia; Norman Douglas, Andrew Titcombe, David Scinto,
Joy Constantinides, Daniel Belton, Patrick Mahoney. They provide ensemble
playing of rare sensitivity.
Antic was made possible by sponsorship from the Stanley Thomas Johnson
Foundation; Daniel Katz; the Leche Trust; the Mathilda and Terence Kennedy
Charitable Trust. It is lamentable that Branstrup's company does not receive
full funding from the Arts Council. I would urge Arc Dance to the attention
of commercial sponsors: Brandstrup's serious and beautiful work stands in
splendid contrast to the mediocrity and vulgarity that is so industriously
promoted and bank-rolled as modern dance in this country by official bodies.
Antic receives its last performance tonight at Sadler's Wells Theatre
