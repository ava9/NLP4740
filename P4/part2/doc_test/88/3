BEFORE THE Prince of Wales so loudly interrupted, I was contemplating
writing an article about why we have so much Shakespeare rather than so
little. It is true that Prince Charles was speaking this week about
Shakespeare in the schools, not Shakespeare in the theatre, but even there
he may be on dubious ground.
The Prince recalls that he was made to study Julius Caesar for O-level at
Gordonstoun, and that the experience left him largely unmoved. Like another
Prince of Wales - Prince Hal in King Henry IV - he was in good, if diverse,
company.
Tony Benn, who went to a rather more academic school, notes in his diaries
how he first saw Hamlet. 'Sunday 25 May 1980: Later I switched on the
television and Hamlet was on. I have never seen it before - what an odd
thing to admit at the age of 55] But like many people I was forced to read
it at school and that put me off for a long time.' Benn's comment is to the
point: 'A remarkable play,' he wrote.
The late Sir Anthony Quayle had an even more dispiriting experience at
Rugby. He records in his autobiography how a visit to the school by a
touring company performing Richard II almost put him off the the theatre for
life. Perhaps like Prince Charles and Mr Benn, Quayle was a late developer.
It may be said that none of them went to the sort of schools that the Prince
was talking about. But if you do not respond to Shakespeare when you are
taught at Gordonstoun, Westminster or Rugby, how do you expect the poor
people at the comprehensives to fare? Why Tony Benn failed to appreciate
Hamlet at an early age may be worth a psychological study in its own right.
The evidence suggests that there is a good deal of Shakespeare around. If
anyone doubts it, go to the Lyric Hammersmith next week where the English
Shakespeare company is putting on excerpts from the history plays specially
for schools. The ESC exists as a touring company, taking Shakespeare all
round the country - and sometimes further.
Then look at the amount of the Bard being played in full. In the last few
weeks more than half the plays that I have reviewed have been Shakespeare.
In a single week, the ESC brought Coriolanus and The Winter's Tale to London
while the RSC was reviving Much Ado About Nothing at the Barbican. A
spectacular modern dress production of Timon of Athens has probably saved
the financial skin of the Young Vic.
Nor have the productions been confined to big names and big companies. There
was another highly enjoyable, modern dress production of The Winter's Tale
playing a few miles away at a pub in Richmond. Two separate productions of
Antony and Cleopatra opened almost simultaneously in London and Birmingham
this month; a third, all-black production is opening in London shortly.
There has just been a new Hamlet in Bristol, let alone the RSC's new season
at Stratford.
One could go on: suffice it say that even when the playwright's name is not
there, the influence is pervasive. I went to see a West African play the
other day, billed as third world feminist. It was impossible to stop being
reminded of Macbeth.
So my original thought was not to complain that there is too much
Shakespeare - there can never be that - but to wonder what has happened to
everything else. The truth is that there are very few good modern plays
being written. Even the latest hit at the National, Black Snow, is based on
a Russian novel written around 1936. The alternative is to go for foreign
plays, but the trouble is that they still tend to turn an English audience
away. Shakespeare fills the gap.
Why is he so popular? Partly he is so full of infinite variety; partly
because he has given so much to the English language. There is the story of
the old lady who - like Mr Benn - saw Hamlet for the first time and remarked
that it was a good play, but too full of quotations.
It was not always so. Only well into the 18th century did Shakespeare come
to be regarded as indisputably greater than his contemporaries. He was not a
scholar and classicist like Ben Jonson. Shakespeare went to Stratford
grammar school and probably could not remember whether he had any O-levels.
With Shakespeare there is always room for re-interpretation. The new
production of Twelfth Night that opened in Stratford this week was generally
praised by the Financial Times and attacked by other newspapers. Even those
who disliked it disagreed about Sir Andrew Aguecheek: one critic said he was
the single redeeming feature; another thought he was the worst Sir Andrew he
had ever seen. Michael Bogdanov, who directs for the ESC, produced a
wonderful Winter's Tale and an execrable Coriolanus, set in Eastern Europe
almost side by side.
But that is what Shakespeare is about. He allows people to read into his
texts what they will. Nigel Lawson is convinced that he was a Tory, drawing
on evidence from Troilus and Cressida. Bogdanov clearly sees him as a left
wing revolutionary, Prince Charles as a constitutional monarchist.
Of his essential Englishness there can be no doubt. Take the gravedigger's
line to Hamlet. The Prince has been sent to England because he was mad: 'He
shall recover his wits there; or, if he do not, 'tis no great matter there .
. . there the men are as mad as he.'
