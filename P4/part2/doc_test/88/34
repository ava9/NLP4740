DELEGATES yesterday agreed to enhance the status of ethnic minorities within
the party and called for the expulsion of any members found to have resorted
to racist tactics.
Mr Ramesh Dewan, an Asian delegate, led a determined attempt to counter
racist charges against Liberal Democrats in Tower Hamlets, east London,
where a candidate from the far-right British National Party was elected to
the local council last week.
He said that 507 of the 711 members of the Tower Hamlets party are Asian and
he challenged Labour to say what percentage of its Tower Hamlets party
members is Asian.
The vote to elevate the ethnic minorities group to the status of a specified
associated organisation easily satisfied the two thirds majority required
for such a constitutional change. Earlier, party leader Mr Paddy Ashdown
reaffirmed that expulsions would follow if the inquiry he has ordered
establishes that Liberal Democrats in Tower Hamlets had used racist tactics.
Endorsing this approach, Mr Dewan promised: 'If we discover a boil we will
lance it'.
The debate came as Labour challenged Mr Ashdown to 'come clean' over his
involvement in the campaigns in Tower Hamlets, claiming the Liberal Democrat
leader was warned about his party's tactics three years before last week's
by-election.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, referred to a letter sent to Mr
Ashdown by a Labour MP in March 1990 complaining about attempts to 'stir up
racial antagonism' in a Liberal Democrat leaflet distributed in the Isle of
Dogs.
