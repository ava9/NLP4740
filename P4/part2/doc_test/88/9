FT  16 SEP 93 / Poll tests level of racial discord: A possible British
National party victory in London

A POSTER campaign against racial attacks will be launched by the Commission
for Racial Equality in London today with government, police and local
authority support.
While the event takes place the far-right British National party will, a few
miles away to the east in Tower Hamlets, be fighting to gain its first
council seat. Should predictions that the party has an outside chance of
winning today's by-election prove correct, members of ethnic minority
communities say the single good effect of the win might be to jolt the
government, police and local authorities into a more powerful bid for racial
harmony than poster campaigns.
The by-election comes in a week which has seen clashes in Tower Hamlets
involving Asian youths, BNP supporters and members of far-left groups
following a savage attack by a white gang on Mr Quaddus Ali, a 17-year-old
Asian student.
Members of ethnic minority communities, mainly Asian, form more than a third
of Tower Hamlets's population. The borough, one of the most deprived in
Britain, is a particular target for BNP activity.
The party contested both parliamentary seats in the general election, and in
another council by-election last year on the Isle of Dogs - scene of today's
by-election - polled 20 per cent of the vote, well ahead of the
Conservatives. Predictions of a possible victory this time have been
promoted by Labour canvass returns showing the BNP at 34 per cent, only five
points behind Labour.
Levels of racial violence and harassment are hard to measure. Not all
disputes between black and white people are racially motived, while many
that are do not get reported. Crime survey and police figures indicate,
however, that racial attacks have increased in many parts of the country in
recent years.
In Newham, which borders Tower Hamlets and has one of London's biggest
ethnic minority populations - 42 per cent - a long-established monitoring
project collects information on incidents of racial violence. Its files
contain reports of a three-year-old knocked unconscious by a brick; homes
daubed with racist graffiti; knife attacks and arson attempts.
No one engaging in such activities is likely to be deterred by poster
campaigns, and last year the Commission for Racial Equality demanded tougher
laws. It wants a specific new offence of racial violence. But some lawyers
argue that this would make it more difficult to secure convictions, while
the government has shown itself reluctant to strengthen existing race
relations legislation.
Complaints of rising racial violence are not confined to London. 'It is
becoming a disgrace to what is supposed to be a civilised society,' said Mr
Maxie Hayles, director of Birmingham's racial attacks monitoring unit. 'I
live in the suburbs, and feel that I have to keep looking over my shoulder.
We need funding for case workers to work alongside victims of harassment and
attacks, providing long-term support.'
Members of ethic minority communities know that their concerns about racial
attacks, and the dangerous influences of far-right political groups, can
easily sound exaggerated. Yet Sir Michael Day, who was the chairman of the
Commission for Racial Equality until earlier this year, left office with a
vivid warning that the extreme right in Britain felt events were moving its
way. 'There is a boldness in the political rhetoric of the extreme right
which conveys a wider acceptability of their views,' he wrote.
The latest test of that political rhetoric will come in today's by-election.
Leaders of the borough's ethnic minority communities hope that, if there is
any strengthening of BNP support, the government will lose no time in
responding to Sir Michael's warnings with stronger legislation.
