Families worry Loudon Wainwright. For more than 20 years his songwriting
career has been spattered with songs that gnaw away at the raw bones of
relationships - father and son, brother and sister, husband and wife, parent
and child. Now as Wainwright drifts through middle age his songs seem
preoccupied more and more with putting the record straight. History, his
latest release, was originally going to be called 'Family Album'; the 14
songs range across the domestic battle field, bleakly cataloguing the
casualties.
His current British tour may be aimed at boosting the sales of History but
in concert the effect is anything but bleak; Wainwright himself comes over
as an energetic, hardworking performer, and immensely likeable. The running
order seems half-improvised, the banter spontaneous. Among the post-Dylan
generation of singer-songwriters he is much closer to Randy Newman than to,
say, Neil Young or Springsteen; he shares with Newman a liking for black
irony, though not his penchant for disguise. With Wainwright there is no
concealment, the nerve ends are bared and the confessional element is
patent.
The humour becomes a vital safety valve, undercutting the despair of his
lyrics, numbing the pain of the idealism that gradually has been eaten away.
Even 'Talking Bob Dylan', Wainwright's witty tribute to his begetter, has a
sharp edge as he charts his hero's progress and implicitly compares it with
his own. Most of the time, he can't help himself - 'Boys kiss girls, make
them cry/That's a man's job'. But when the humour drops away the effect can
be devastating: in 'Hitting You', which traces his disintegrating
relationship with his daughter, there is nothing but despair.
There were old songs too - 'Be Careful There's a Baby in the House' from
1971 and a rousing C &amp; W version of 'Dead Skunk' - as well as something
brand new, in Wainwright's hymn to the Clinton inauguration: 'Talking about
our generation/Hope we grow up before we get old'. The subject matter, as
always, doesn't bear thinking about; it is a tribute to Wainwright's feisty
resilience that his audience are able laugh a lot more than they cry; look
at me, he's telling them, I know it's all awful, but I'm still here, still
laughing.
