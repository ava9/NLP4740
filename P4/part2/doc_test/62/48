CHRISTMAS is the time when boxing heavyweights dress up as Widow Twankey and
pop heavyweights release albums to catch the present mood. Often the music
sounds as if it has been written to fulfil a recording contract (which it
has) rather than a spontaneous creative impulse, and, having just signed a
Dollars 50m deal with Warners, that must be especially true of Madonna's
Erotica, the album of her book, Sex.
One imagines that Madonna expects the world to sit at home breathing
heavily, flicking through the photographs of her sexual fantasies while
listening to the album. I tried it out and it is very much like being
hypnotised: not unpleasant, in fact rather soothing. The pictures are for
peering at rather than for generating pleasure and the songs on Erotica have
that metronomic disco beat that says get up and dance or else nod off.
At office parties throughout the land Erotica will doubtless kindle many
morning-after embarrassments. Best not to listen to the words, which have an
obscure suggestiveness, like a child trying to shock; just concentrate on
the remorseless beat. It takes some skill for Madonna to be both soporific
and rhythmic at the same time. On songs like 'Where life begins' she seems
to have invented trance dance.
You can hear the money shouting through what is really a disappointing
album, lacking a leavening of the good natured pop songs like 'Holiday', or
locker room singalongs, like 'Like a Virgin', which made Madonna's previous
albums notable. There are some infectious riffs, like 'Words', but basically
this is just a cop out for disco DJ's who will be able to press the button
and disappear for an hour while Madonna struts relentlessly and, ultimately,
tediously, on. The sooner she stops being the sexual midwife to the world
and gets back to escapist pop songs the better for everyone.
Madonna is not alone in breathing heavily over her output. Prince has also
done quite well out of blatancy and his latest album, packaged under a wonky
looking male gender symbol, is almost a direct riposte to Erotica. Yet there
is something tongue in cheek about Prince, his tiny, mannikin body being
sexually threatening in a decidedly controllable way. Also his songs are
strong enough to stand on their own, without the innuendo.
He starts his album with Madonna-like self absorption, with 'My name is
Prince', but really this is nothing more than an excuse for a funky rap.
Then on to the no-nonsense 'Sexy MF'. What separates Prince from Madonna is
that his sound, lyrics and sexual politics seems directly to reflect black
urban culture; he is the outlet for the fantasies of his generation. Madonna
is alone with her fantasies.
The new album hardly elevates Prince's work to a new creative plane, but it
is beautifully crafted. Here the sound rides over the egomania, with hints
of jazz and soul in the excellent brass backings. Both these albums are
aimed at dudes, not prudes, and it is odd that pop, so late in its day,
should be pandering so narrowly to the youth market.
For the most endearing characteristic of pop is that it ends up embracing
every artist who ever graced the charts. Critical disaster areas, like ABBA,
can be certain of becoming the centre of the largest cults. The only
performer excluded from the party is perhaps the greatest pop star of them
all, Bob Dylan. Perhaps Dylan asks for it by his perverse concert
performances where he performs badly and in the dark, but in the 1960s he
gave pop music the cultural and intellectual respectability that it has
never lost.
His latest album, Good as I been to you, has been massacred by the critics
and yet it is fascinating. He has gone back to the traditional ballads which
inspired some of his greatest songs (like 'Boots of Spanish Leather'), and
records them in one take and with no over dubbing. Even the most mundane of
songs, 'Frankie and Albert' (Johnnie, to you) somehow seems more real, more
immediate in Dylan's hands, hands that fly over the guitar like demons.
Sometimes he sounds like an old man howling on the corner, but always there
is an intensity, a humanity in that nasal drone. Perhaps it is one
dimensional but this is Dylan's most accessible album in years, minimalist
in format but big in impact.
In contrast to Dylan, his contemporary, Neil Young, enjoys growing critical
acclaim, perhaps because, in his old hobo stage act, he has matured with wit
and style. His latest album, Harvest Moon, is a clever parody of Harvest, a
seminal album of 20 years ago which featured such pained classics as 'Heart
of Gold'. He actually calls on some of the same musicians, notably James
Taylor and Linda Ronstadt, to join him on Harvest Moon.
The songs do not have the same aching grip as those of the previous
generation, but they sound smoother, gentler, more reflective. There is a
nostalgic air of time passing, but the mood is more superficial, even in the
questioning 'From Hank to Hendrix'. But perhaps that is the difference
between seamless CD and crackly old LP.
