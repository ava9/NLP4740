THERE ARE books and then there are beautiful books which combine graceful
typography, sumptuous illustration with superlative printing technique.
Among the world's greatest publishers of limited edition, hand-crafted books
was the Welsh-based Gregynog Press which flourished between 1922 and 1940,
producing 42 books in that time. An exhibition currently showing in London
offers a rare opportunity to view some of them, as well as those of its
successor, Gwasg Gregynog (Gwasg is Welsh for press) established in the late
1970s and still in business.
Gregynog, located in Newtown, Powys, was the inspiration of two sisters,
Gwendoline and Margaret Davis, who purchased the hall, from which the press
takes its name, and 750 acres of land just after the end of the First World
War. The family wealth had been accumulated from the south Wales coalfields
and the sisters, wishing to be philanthropic, decided to create an arts and
crafts centre for Wales.
The press was to be an integral part of this enterprise and in 1922 Robert
Maynard was appointed the first controller, with Walter Bray as resident
artist, who curiously enough knew nothing about wood engraving and had to
learn the technique from Maynard.
But it wasn't until the 1930s, with the appointment of Blair Hughes-Stanton
as resident artist and William MacCance as controller, that Gregynog entered
a phase establishing it as one of the finest private presses in the world.
In the space of three years some magnificent books were printed, each
edition numbering rarely more than a couple of hundred copies, many
illustrated with wood engravings by Hughes-Stanton ('The Lamentations of
Jeremiah', 'Erewhom' and 'The Revelations of St John the Divine', being
among the best) and others by Agnes Miller Parker, MacCance's wife, and
Gertrude Hermes, married to Hughes-Stanton.
While the artistic quality during this period was superlative human
relations were less than harmonious and both Hughes-Stanton and MacCance
left the press in 1933. Seven years later Gregynog was wound up.
The University of Wales re-opened the press in the late 1970s, reusing the
same workshops and some of the original printing equipment, the first book
to be published being R. S. Thomas's Laboratories of the Spirit. Since then
other notable limited editions have been poems by Dylan Thomas, illustrated
by John Piper, and the Mountains of Wales, designed by John Ryder.
The early Gregynog Press books are now highly collectable and fetch many
thousands of pounds at auction. Those printed by Gwasg Gregynog are more
affordable (many of those currently in print can be purchased for under
Pounds 100, some for much less) and undoubtedly will become prized by
bibliophiles in the future.
The exhibition of continues at the Lethaby Gallery, Central St Martins
College of Art and Design, Southampton Row, London until May 16.
