IN THE SUMMER of 1989, this column wrote that the columnist Art Buchwald was 
going to sue Paramount for a share of profits from the Eddie Murphy hit "Coming 
to America." As you know, Buchwald did, and recently Judge Harvey Schneider 
ruled in Los Angeles that Paramount must pay Art and Alain Bernheim damages. 
(This ruling shook the studio system to its dark roots and threatens a real 
upheaval in Hollywood.)

Buchwald tells me that there will no doubt be appeals and more appeals after 
the amount of money has been fixed. ("Coming to America" earned more than $300 
million, based on a treatment Buchwald and Bernheim sold to Paramount.) "My 
fear is that my grandchildren will see the money -- not me!" says Art. Added 
the funny man: "The part I like best about the entire thing is that Paramount's 
lawyers, from the beginning, have kept calling me a 'crybaby!' They said I 
signed a contract and then cried after I didn't like the terms. Now they are 
the ones who are crying the hardest. The Hollywood trade papers even announced 
that Paramount had canceled its Christmas party this year because of the 
judge's decision. Now that is carrying things too far. I am very upset if they 
canceled Christmas."

THE OFFBEAT Gary Oldman has portrayed some unusual, creative real-life souls -- 
rocker Sid Vicious in the movie "Sid and Nancy" and the self-destructive gay 
playwright Joe Orton in "Prick Up Your Ears." Now this hugely talented Briton 
plans to assay another literary genius on the downhill slide. He will portray 
the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas in a film to be directed by David Drury. This 
movie, which begins filming in January, co-stars Mrs. Gary Oldman -- actress 
Uma Thurman. She'll be Caitlin Thomas, the wife of Dylan. Shooting takes place 
both in New York City, where Thomas died of drink and poor medical attention 
back in 1953, and in his hometown of Laugharne.
