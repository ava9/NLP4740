Monsignor McClancy High School's basketball team passed on Shamu, then it blew 
past Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
The East Elmhurst, N.Y., school had Sea World scheduled on its morning 
itinerary Wednesday after arriving at 10 the previous night, but Coach Don Kent 
decided to cancel Shamu and his ocean friends. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Crusaders canceled Torrey Pines, 75-56, in the first round of the 
Above the Rim Hoopwear Prep Classic in front of a standing room-only crowd at 
Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
"We were concerned because we were playing a host team in front of a big crowd 
and we knew they would overachieve," Kent said. "We were very concerned when 
they cut the lead to 10." 
</P>
<P>
That was with 3:26 left in the third quarter, when Torrey Pines reeled off nine 
consecutive points and wiped out a 40-22 halftime deficit to make it 48-38. 
</P>
<P>
But after a three-point play by Michael Chaplin and a 15-footer by Rich 
Hemphill made it 53-39 entering the fourth quarter, the Falcons (8-2) never got 
closer than 14. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we played well in the second half," said John Farrell, Torrey Pines 
coach. "I never did feel we were in continuity in the first half. I was 
disappointed in our defense; we have to be able to pressure people." 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines, hurt by recent injuries, brought up four sophomores and a 
freshman to the varsity. The freshman, Eddie Montalvo, started at guard. He had 
five points and three assists. 
</P>
<P>
McClancy's Michael Chaplin, who's committed to attend Texas, scored a game-high 
23 points. Rich Hemphill scored 16, Dylan Ervin 12 and Anthony Iapoce 10. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines got 11 points apiece from Dan Reynaga and John Allred, who fouled 
out with 4:24 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines plays at 2:45 p.m. today against Valhalla. McClancy plays at 4:30 
today against Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
St. Anthony 87, Camden 65 -- Jersey City, N.J., and Camden are two hours away 
by car, but the schools went 3,000 miles to meet on the basketball floor. St. 
Anthony, ranked No. 3 in the nation, traveled that far to face No. 18 Camden, a 
team it might very well play in the New Jersey state playoffs. The teams split 
their previous two games, in 1979 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Danny Hurley would like the national powers to play more often. 
</P>
<P>
"They're two great schools with two great reputations, two great coaches, great 
talent, it's beneficial to everyone," Hurley said. "It creates a lot of 
excitement." 
</P>
<P>
It certainly did. 
</P>
<P>
The Friars (4-1) outscored Camden 26-9 in the final five minutes to break open 
a 61-56 ballgame. Camden (3-1), ranked 18th nationally, trailed by 14 in the 
final seconds of the third quarter before a 15-5 run. 
</P>
<P>
St. Anthony's Rodrick Rhodes, who is trying to decide between attending 
Arizona, Seton Hall and Ohio State, scored 21 points and had eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln 91, Valhalla 85 -- Lincoln outscored Valhalla 33-16 in the final 
quarter to advance to today's second round. Lincoln (6-5) shot 62% from the 
field in the second half and got a game-high 27 points and team-high 11 
rebounds from junior Berry Randle. Hosa Baker scored 19 and Archie Robinson 17 
for the Hornets, who also got 12 points from John Akridge. 
</P>
<P>
Valhalla (8-2) led 47-38 at halftime but shot 45% in the second half. Cole 
Deneen scored 25 and Mark Dillon 21 to lead the Norsemen. 
</P>
<P>
Miami Senior 95, Las Vegas Bonanza 75 -- Miami Senior (9-1), ranked No. 9 in 
the nation, took a 50-35 halftime lead and held off Bonanza (8-3). Steve 
Edwards led all scorers with 29 points, and Tony Sanders had 19 for Miami. Ben 
Hanks scored 10. 
</P>
<P>
Bonanza got 27 points from Eric Long and 26 from Jamal Willis but had no one 
else score in double figures. Willis had 14 rebounds.
