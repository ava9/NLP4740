There's a joke about an anthropologist who thinks he knows all the ways of the 
remote tribe he's been living with for two years, but one night a frantic, 
desperate drumming commences, and the chief will say only that if the drumming 
ever stops, a terrible, terrible thing will occur. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, as the night wears on to morning and the drumming pounds on, the 
anthropologist pleads with the chief, "Please, we're blood brothers, tell me, 
what is the terrible, terrible thing that happens if the drumming stops?" 
</P>
<P>
"Bass solo starts." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Mighty Flyers' bassist Bill Stuve knew better than to fill his 
recently released solo album with lengthy pronouncements from his unwieldy 
stand-up bass. Instead, his low notes mostly just provide the solid support 
that has marked Stuve's 13 years as a founding Flyer, while his singing and the 
solid ensemble swinging of his assembled blues stars make his "Big Noise" album 
live up to its title. 
</P>
<P>
This Sunday, Stuve is going live with his Big Noise, performing at Crawford's 
Nightclub in Lakewood with most of the album's artists, who compose a large 
chunk of the local blues scene. 
</P>
<P>
There'll be harpists James Harman and Johnny Dyer (Dyer doesn't appear on the 
album), sax giant Lee Allen (a former Blaster and featured soloist with Little 
Richard and Fats Domino), pianist Steve F'Dor, and fellow Flyers Alex Schultz 
on guitar and Jimi Bott on drums. Rounding out the group are Jeff Turmes 
(bassist with the Harman Band), Brett Wheeler on saxes and Eddie Reed on 
guitar. (The album's Jr. Watson, a former Mighty Flyer and Canned Heat member, 
has a conflicting gig on Sunday.) 
</P>
<P>
The Mighty Flyers have been a staple on the Orange County blues scene for more 
than a decade (they perform one of the final shows at the fading Sunset Pub 
tonight; see story on F1). More recently, they've become a major festival 
attraction in Europe. Two people not appearing on Stuve's album are Flyers lead 
singer/harmonica player Rod Piazza and his keyboardist wife, Honey Alexander, 
but that's not because of a falling out. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Stuve said, "I just thought if I got them on it, it would be too much 
like a Flyers record, and I wanted to do some different things, like using 
horns. There are only two or three songs with harmonica on the album." 
</P>
<P>
The album boasts three Stuve compositions as well as a Stuve/Bott arrangement 
of the title track, adapted from the Bob Crosby standard "Big Noise From 
Winnetka." The other selections -- including tunes from Clarence (Gatemouth) 
Brown, Muddy Waters, Otis Spann and rockabilly obscurity Lew Williams -- are 
mostly songs Stuve has performed onstage with the Flyers but never recorded 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than creating a conflict with the Flyers, Stuve feels his solo outing 
helps his relations with the group. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens in bands, I've found, with a lot of cats is they're writing and 
doing songs on the bandstand, but it's a different priority when the recording 
comes along," Stuve said. "In this situation, it's Rod's band, and he's such a 
monster on the harp that it's kind of tough to get my stuff out there (on the 
Flyers' records). So instead of getting all negative and bummed out and 
quitting the band or anything, I've got this optimistic outlet, which I think 
has been a healthy thing for me and the band." 
</P>
<P>
Stuve said the solo project is something he'd always wanted to do. "Then when 
we were touring in Europe these companies said, 'Bill, if you ever record 
anything we'd like to hear it.' So I said what the heck and booked some studio 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The "Big Noise" CD has been released only in Europe. Stuve hopes to make a 
distribution deal with Rounder Records in the United States. In the meantime, 
he is distributing the imports himself. "I'm doing like Colonel Parker in the 
old days," he said, "taking them to the record stores and to the gigs." (The CD 
can be found locally at the Music Market in Costa Mesa and Lamar's Records in 
Long Beach.) 
</P>
<P>
Stuve, 39, started in music as a youngster, providing drum accompaniment for 
his piano-playing grandfather. "Then came the Stones and the Beatles, and I 
said, 'Forget that!' and got a guitar. Then I found I was always showing bass 
players their parts -- maybe it came easier because of my drum education. There 
were always a lot of guitar players around, so I got a gig playing electric 
bass, and from there went on to the stand-up." 
</P>
<P>
He cites such influences as Willie Dixon, early Muddy Waters bassist Big 
Crawford and Slam Stewart, and he says bass (which he calls "the big doghouse") 
never gets boring for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a lot you can do with it," he said. "People say, 'Oh, it's 
just three chords,' but there's all these colorings, interactions between the 
band members, and of course working with the audience. So I don't have a 
problem with it." 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers have a new album, called "Blues in the Dark," due in January on the 
Rounder-distributed Blacktop label. They also have a new publicist and booking 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully we'll go to another plateau," Stuve said, "but I really can't 
complain about our success. Everything I've wanted to do since I was a child 
has come true. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something just being able to play music and make a living doing it. And 
we've been able to travel in Europe extensively where, boy, are they 
appreciative of American music. Finland was our first stop ever outside the 
U.S. It was the middle of winter, freezing cold, but the audience was amazing, 
like something you'd imagine the early Stones and Beatles things were like. 
They wouldn't stop clamoring. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always a little frustrating because at home, the style of music we're 
playing really doesn't get the acceptance you'd hope for. But I think now blues 
seems to be making a little turnaround. And sometimes when you're touring 
there's going to be the night-after-night drudgery, but overall, I think if you 
can be happy 75% of the time up there on the bandstand, then that's better than 
most other guys got." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Stuve's "Big Noise" performs Sunday at 8 p.m. at Crawford's Nightclub, 
11529 Carson St. (west of the San Gabriel River Freeway), Lakewood. The Deep 
Blue Sea band opens at 6 p.m. Admission: $2. Information: (213) 924-0446.
