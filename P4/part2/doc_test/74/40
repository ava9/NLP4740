John Clayton Jr. is rapidly becoming one of the most internationally respected 
bassists and composers and with good reason, when you consider his credits. 
</P>
<P>
As a jazzman, he's played with the Count Basie Orchestra and pianist Monty 
Alexander; as a classicist, he served as principal bassist with the Amsterdam 
Philharmonic for five years. 
</P>
<P>
As a bandleader, he co-leads the Clayton-Hamilton Orchestra with his brother, 
saxophonist Jeff Clayton, and drummer Jeff Hamilton. The group, which made one 
of its rare appearances Monday at the Biltmore Hotel's Grand Avenue Bar, has 
two albums due out next week: an instrumental set on Capri Records and one 
backing singer Ernestine Anderson on Concord. The brothers also co-lead a 
quintet, which appears tonight at the Indigo Jazz Club in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
As a composer and arranger, Clayton went to West Germany three times last year, 
mainly to write music for the Cologne Radio Orchestra. He also contributed 
works for Doc Severinsen's Tonight Show Orchestra, and for six weeks -- which 
he describes as "my write-till-I-drop period" -- wrote dozens of arrangements 
for the Gene Harris Phillip Morris Superband, prior to its 1989 world tour. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton said his current inspiration as a writer is Academy Award winner Johnny 
Mandel. "I have to learn how to work with synthesizers and computers," Clayton 
said, "and Johnny has been my mentor, just as Ray Brown was when I was studying 
the bass. Henry Mancini helps me too." 
</P>
<P>
In between writing assignments, Clayton's life as a touring and recording 
musician, and as a bass teacher, goes on unabated. In the past year he has 
toured Holland with pianist Alexander, gigged with John Collins, Benny Carter, 
Bud Shank, Carmen McRae and Nancy Wilson, and recorded with Rosemary Clooney 
and Mancini. He also took part in a series of instructional videos along with 
fellow bassists Ray Brown, Milt Hinton and Francois Rabbath, the French 
classical virtuoso. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps enough is enough. "For the next year," he said, "I really have to cut 
down on the traveling. With these albums coming out, I want to establish the 
big band, and work on writing projects in Los Angeles. Of course, I can still 
go back to Germany when they need me." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Los Angeles in 1952 into a musical family -- "My mother still is a 
wonderful pianist and conducts church choirs" -- the tall, personable Clayton 
began his bass studies with Ray Brown at 16. Only three years later, he was the 
bassist on the TV series "The Mancini Generation." He gave up the series to 
complete his studies at Indiana University; then came two seminal years as he 
toured the United States and Europe with Monty Alexander. The Basie gig came 
next. 
</P>
<P>
"After leaving Basie, I moved to Holland, but I flew right back to take part in 
the finals of the National Black Music Colloquium and Competition," he said. "I 
tied with a viola player for first place in the strings division. But 
meanwhile, I had auditioned for the Amsterdam Philharmonic, so I went right 
back and started there." 
</P>
<P>
Widely accepted though he is on the Los Angeles music front, Clayton is 
disturbed by a lingering racism he finds all around him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really sad. I'll look around in a studio and see that I'm the only black 
player in the whole place, out of maybe 60 musicians," he said. "It's the same 
with big jazz bands; it's shocking to me that anyone could have a big band in 
Los Angeles and go on and on for years without even accidentally having a 
single black player. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the number of black jazz musicians who are capable, anxious and willing, 
this situation is ludicrous. It's important to reach out to the young black 
players and open the door for them. 
</P>
<P>
"I could shrug my shoulders and say, 'Well, that's the way it is; nobody says 
the music business is fair.' But if I do that, things will only get worse, so I 
can't ignore the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Given his widespread credits in playing and writing, in classical and jazz, 
what does Clayton hope for in his future? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to spend 40% of my time playing jazz bass, 40% composing, and 20% 
playing classical music," he said. "My loves are playing bass, in any style or 
capacity, and writing music; so as I have my bass or my pen in my hands, I'm 
happy."
