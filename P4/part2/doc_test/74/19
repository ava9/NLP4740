Serious jazz buffs know about Ray Anderson, but a casual listener might well 
ask "Ray who?" 
</P>
<P>
Anderson finds himself in the role of the underdog, trying build a career as a 
leader around the trombone, an instrument that hasn't always fared well in a 
leadership role. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Anderson, who plays Elario's Monday and Tuesday nights, is forging ahead. 
He has been voted best trombonist in the Downbeat Critics Poll for the last 
four years. His newest album, "What Because," includes pianist John Hicks, whom 
many believe to be one of the underrated greats. Anderson is quick enough and 
imaginative enough to carry a solo as well as a trumpet or sax player. He sings 
in a raspy growl reminiscent of Louis Armstrong and has played or recorded with 
Carla Bley, Charlie Haden, John Scofield, Anthony Braxton and Henry Threadgill. 
And for years, Anderson made his living in funk-band horn sections and recorded 
an album with a group called the Slickaphonics. 
</P>
<P>
At Elario's, Anderson will be joined by pianist Amina Claudine Myers, who also 
worked with Haden, plus bassist Mark Helias and drummer Dion Parson. There will 
be two shows nightly, at 8:30 and 10:30. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist-keyboard man David Benoit proved his musical prowess once and for all 
with last year's "Waiting for Spring." On that album, he departed from his 
usual dreamy, electric light jazz for some stirring acoustic jazz. Benoit's 
next album will mark a return to the electric mode. Benoit, a staple of light 
jazz radio, plays Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay this Sunday at 7 and 9. 
</P>

Del Mar guitarist Peter Sprague is everywhere this week. Today, he plays the 
San Diego Museum of Art's "Jazz After Work" series at 4:30 on the steps of the 
museum, in Balboa Park. Vocalist Coral Thuet will be featured on several 
Brazilian tunes by such musicians as Antonio Carlos Jobim, Milton Nascimento, 
Djavan and Joao Bosco. Tonight, Sprague's trio plays the Full Moon Cafe in 
Encinitas; Friday night, the city of Carlsbad's TGIF Jazz series at Stage Coach 
Park (3420 Camino de los Coches); and Saturday night, Diego's Loft in Pacific 
Beach, above Diego's Mexican restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the trio's sets include several Brazilian-flavored songs written by 
guitarist Pat Metheny, with whom a young Sprague studied in Boston during the 
late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"They have such strong melodies, they can be done in a lot of contexts," 
Sprague said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the business side of his career is on a new path. He recently signed 
with a new manager, Dick Deutsch, who formerly managed the late guitarist Emily 
Remler. Deutsch's first task will be to shop around Sprague's demo tape in 
search of an album deal. 
</P>
<P>
Top local pianist Randy Porter, who works regularly with singer Diane Schuur 
and behind several top players at Elario's, is moving to Oregon in September. 
</P>
<P>
Porter, wife Cindy and month-old daughter Rachel Emily will live in a suburb of 
Portland, which Porter thinks might be a great place to raise a family. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people wonder why, when things seem to be going so well here, I would 
want to move up there," Porter said. "It's kind of a personal thing, for 
creative growth I want to achieve, which even takes priority over playing with 
other people. Being in a natural environment for me is more stimulating. Some 
people thrive around cement, but I like being around trees. 
</P>
<P>
Porter hopes to maintain his association with the young San Diego 
straight-ahead jazz band Common Ground, which also includes Steve Feierabend, 
Dave Marr and Tim McMahon. He hopes to return to Southern California often to 
play with Schuur and others. Porter plays the San Diego Museum of Art's "Jazz 
After Work" series with saxophonist Charles McPherson Aug. 16 at 4:30. He 
appears with Schuur Aug. 9 at The Strand in Redondo Beach; Aug. 10 at 
Humphrey's in San Diego; and Aug. 11 at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
During the Korean War years, Joe Franc played French horn with the 93rd Army 
Band, attached to the AAA (Anti-Aircraft Artillery) branch of the Army. Among 
his band mates: San Diegans Rod Cradit, Tony Higgins and John Pecoraro. 
</P>
<P>
The band played military marches, but also swing jazz for USO dances. Franc is 
putting together an Oct. 18 band reunion. If you were in the band or know 
someone who was, give him a call at 279-0844. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego guitarist Hank Easton hasn't been signed by a major label yet, but 
his self-produced CD, "San Diego Sunset," has won favor from local jazz writers 
(not just this one) and airplay on KIFM. 
</P>
<P>
Easton jammed with jazz celebrity Bob James two weeks ago at the San Diego 
Hilton. James was in town for a vacation, and Easton was sitting in with San 
Diego band Real to Reel. James joined the group for a version of his theme from 
the television show "Taxi." 
</P>
<P>
Easton and his band play tonight from 6 to 11 at the Mission Bay Hilton and 
Saturday from 5:30 to 7:30 at the Coronado Ferry Landing. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Pianist Rob Schneiderman, appearing with saxophonist Jimmy Heath at 
Elario's, has a busy career of his own. A new album with drummer Billy Higgins 
and bassist Rufus Reid is due this fall. Drummer Sherman Ferguson is taking the 
place of John Guerin in the second and final week of Heath's stay that ends 
Sunday night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Legendary guitarist Barney Kessel, who now calls San Diego home, may sign with 
local management group Brady &amp; Associates. Longtime KSDS-FM (88.3) disc 
jockey Tony Sidotti, who recently went to work with Brady, is working on 
cementing a deal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dick Braun and his Orchestra play Chula Vista's Music in the Park summer music 
seres at 4:30 p.m. Sunday in Friendship Park, behind the public library (365 F 
St.). . . . 
</P>
<P>
This Saturday night's edition of "Club Date," the jazz show on KPBS-TV, 
features singer Anita O'Day, backed by locals Bob Magnusson on bass, Randy 
Porter on piano and Jim Plank on drums. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Most Valuable Players plays light jazz at the B St. Cafe tonight through 
Saturday night. . . .
