Clare Fischer must have been deeply touched by the outpouring of support and 
affection for him from the Los Angeles music community at a tribute concert at 
the Wadsworth Theatre in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
It was a benefit to help cover the pianist's recent extraordinary medical 
expenses, and a long line of performers turned out. Much of the music reflected 
Fischer's continuing interest in Latin rhythms. Its quality, despite the good 
intentions, varied from group to group. 
</P>
<P>
Secret 9 -- actually a quartet -- opened the Thursday evening concert with a 
set that virtually bristled with electronic energy. But the ensemble's flashy 
note flurries and high-speed tempos were rarely matched by an equivalent amount 
of musical warmth. 
</P>
<P>
The group was followed by the appealing pop jazz of Syndicado Brasil, sporting 
two lead singers and a colorful collection of samba rhythms. Rudy Regaldo's 
15-piece ensemble, Chevere, was even better. The ensemble's sizzling Afro-Cuban 
rhythms, soaring vocals and powerful ensemble work provided both the musical 
and the emotional high points of the the first half of the program, which 
concluded with a solo-oriented set from an ensemble featuring guitarist Rick 
Zunigar, bassist Jeff Berlin, drummer Alex Acuna and percussionist Luis Conte. 
</P>
<P>
Chick Corea's unannounced appearance with his acoustic trio (Dave Weckl on 
drums and John Patitucci on bass) was the musical meat and potatoes of the 
program. A brief excursion through "How Deep Is The Ocean?" underlined how 
effectively Corea has managed to blend the rich harmonies of mainstream jazz 
with the complex rhythms of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist David Benoit had the misfortune to follow Corea -- a positioning that 
only served to emphasize the fragile level of creativity that sometimes 
afflicts his music. Typically, Benoit's best number was a light-hearted romp 
through Vince Guaraldi's "Linus and Lucy." 
</P>
<P>
The long evening finally wound to a close with a lovely a capella performance 
from Fischer's vocal quartet and a funk-drenched appearance by Tom Scott's "Pat 
Sajak Show Band." 
</P>
<P>
Donations to help fund Fischer's recovery from severe head injuries continue to 
be accepted by Musicians Wives, Inc./Clare Fischer Fund at P.O Box 4685, North 
Hollywood, 91607. DON HECKMAN
