Following Michel Camilo's hourlong opening set at Catalina Bar and Grill in 
Hollywood Tuesday evening, it was difficult to tell whether the pianist or the 
piano needed a rest more. 
</P>
<P>
From his opening rendition of John Coltrane's "Impressions" to his closing "On 
Fire," the Dominican Republic-born Camilo brought his firebrand style of jazz 
to exuberant life. One could easily imagine smoke pouring from the piano in 
response to the demands Camilo made of it. 
</P>
<P>
Camilo, a pleasant young man with an ingratiating, gap-toothed smile, rarely 
relaxed his formidable chops during the six-tune opening set. Even during solo 
moments by bassist Michael Bowie and drummer Cliff Almond, the pianist could 
not resist the urge to noodle -- his poking at inventive melody, his sudden 
blasts of richly voiced chords lending additional urgency and fury to the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Though a certain spontaneity was lost due to the tightly arranged repertoire of 
the band, there was no shortage of individual expression within the rigid 
formatting of each tune. Bassist Bowie, whose support role was performed 
meticulously, had particularly fine outings on Dizzy Gillespie's "Birk's 
Works," a bluesy, easygoing tune that had Camilo at his most economical, and on 
the leader's own "This Way Out." 
</P>
<P>
Drummer Almond showed himself a masterful technician who managed effortlessly 
to support the rhythmic rage of his leader. His solos came in the form of short 
bursts of descending rhythm patterns that lent a welcome musicality. 
</P>
<P>
Camilo's talents as a composer are considerable. "Uptown Manhattan," "This Way 
Out" and "On Fire," each with a hint of his Latin roots, proved to be pieces 
worthy of jazz exploration, their harmonic structures quite capable of 
supporting melodic invention. 
</P>
<P>
The only real disappointment of the evening came from Camilo's too few 
inclusions of songs that made fewer demands on energy. Though "Uptown 
Manhattan" was an easily paced swing tune -- but only after a blast-off intro 
-- there were no ballads. Jaco Pastorius' "City of the Angels" came closest, 
with its sense of tranquility, but not close enough. Camilo's technique and 
musicality are significant and it would have been curious to have heard him 
play something a bit more relaxed. A. JAMES LISKA
