Legendary sax man James Moody moved to San Diego in April and had his first gig 
in his new hometown Wednesday night at Elario's. 
</P>
<P>
Moody came west from Jersey City to live with his new wife, Linda, a real 
estate agent here. The two tied the knot April 3 in a ceremony at Faith Chapel 
in Spring Valley. Dizzy Gillespie served as best man and played a few pieces, 
including the solo from "Con Alma" as the couple walked in. 
</P>
<P>
"I love her as big as the sky," said Moody, still madly in love and poetic as 
always. He first met his wife during a gig at Catalina's in Los Angeles. They 
didn't see each other for about a year, then they hooked up again when Moody 
came to town to play at Elario's last December. Sparks flew and Moody says he 
had a hard time touring a short time later without her. 
</P>
<P>
"I called her every day. My hotel bill in Egypt for the week. . . . Wow! I was 
sending her two or three faxes a day." 
</P>
<P>
Moody recently spent two weeks in Hong Kong playing The Jazz Club. His new 
album "Sweet and Lovely," dedicated to the new missus, is scheduled for an 
August release. At Elario's, where he will play through Sunday, he'll be backed 
by Sherman Ferguson on drums, Bob Magnusson on bass and a pianist (perhaps 
Harry Pickens, Randy Porter or Art Resnick). 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Lee Ritenour, who hits San Diego for Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay 
series Friday, feels strong ties to the music of Brazil. The best cuts on his 
last album "Festival" blend Brazilian melodies, rhythms and vocals with the 
driving funk of Marcus Miller's bass and percussion supplied by Brazilian 
Paulinho Da Costa. 
</P>
<P>
"Rit Colors," scheduled for fall release, also has some Brazilian flavor. 
Ritenour went to a funky studio in Salvador, in the Brazilian state of Bahia, 
to record a singer named Gonza Guinha for one cut. Most of the album's vocals 
are handled by Phil Perry, who will play with Ritenour in San Diego, along with 
Bob Wilson (former drummer in the fusion group Seawind), Ernie Watts on sax, 
Tim Landers on bass and Dave Witham on keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
Ritenour, also known as a top '70s studio musician for his work with Herbie 
Hancock, Steely Dan, Stanley Clarke and many others, has been a commercial 
success for years, but "Festival" is his hottest album yet. It has sold more 
than 200,000 copies since its release last October. 
</P>
<P>
With the earlier "Rio" and "Rit" both gold or close to it (500,000 copies), 
Ritenour is, along with Dave Grusin, one of the most commercially successful 
artists on the GRP contemporary jazz label, founded by Grusin and partner Larry 
Rosen.

Talking Wood is a San Diego band built around the warm sounds of the African 
slit drum and is one of several bands scheduled to play the Second Annual Jazz 
Iz Forever, an all-day outdoor music festival this Saturday at the Educational 
Cultural Complex, 4343 Ocean View Blvd., in Southeast San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's concert was dedicated to local jazz singer Ella Ruth Piggee, who 
died of cancer. This year's is a tribute to Dr. Danny Scarborough, former head 
of the Afro-American Studies Department at San Diego State University and the 
director of the school's Black Repertory Dance Co. Scarborough, a prominent 
local educator, died of AIDS two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Other bands that will appear during the 12-hour celebration, which begins at 8 
a.m., include Hollis Gentry's Neon, Forecast, Jeannie and Jimmy Cheatham and 
their Sweet Baby Blues Band, Swell, Reel to Real, Escola Brazilian Experience, 
Immediate Freedom Latin Jazz Ensemble, Glenn Horiuchi Quartet, Ayana Hobson 
Trio, Charles McPherson Jr. and the Lila Smith Trio. The band War ("Cisco Kid," 
"Slipping Into Darkness") is a special guest. 
</P>
<P>
Percussionists Bill Thompson and Gregory Blakney form the nucleus of Talking 
Wood. Besides the slit drum (which is played with mallets), Talking Wood also 
incorporates imbira (African thumb piano), gourd rattle, African claves, 
tom-toms, and, from Java, hank lungs (bamboo percussion instruments). 
</P>
<P>
The heavily rhythmic sound includes a lot of improvisation. Nonstop 
performances typically last a half-hour or longer. Talking Wood hits the stage 
a 9 Saturday morning.
