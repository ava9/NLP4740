A CEXTON SAMPLER

Among the better releases from the growing Cexton catalogue are: 
</P>
<P>
JOHN ANELLO JR. 
</P>
<P>
"For a Dancer" 
</P>
<P>
"Jackson Street Beat" 
</P>
<P>
Light, melodic pop jazz by "Mr. Relentless" himself, who turns out to be a 
surprisingly gentle performer. Anello's sprightly melodies dominate both 
recordings, along with a few strong passages from John Anello Sr.'s alto 
saxophone and flute. 
</P>
<P>
SCOTT KREITZER 
</P>
<P>
"Kick 'N Off" 
</P>
<P>
Tenor saxophonist Kreitzer plays his instrument with a brisk majestic authority 
rarely heard in younger players (he is 23). His admiration of Sonny Rollins is 
most notably apparent during a tour de force romp through "Airegin." A strong 
rhythm section of Dave Samuels on vibes, Marc Cohen on piano, Harvie Swartz on 
bass and Bill Stewart on drums provides sturdy support, but the addition of a 
string section on several tracks is an unnecessary distraction from the 
otherwise strong jazz proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
BIG WORLD 
</P>
<P>
"Devotion" 
</P>
<P>
A fascinating recording from a trio -- pianist Rick Helzer, flutist/saxist Bill 
Plake and percussionist Jeanette Wrate -- that ranges from avant-garde to 
off-the-wall hard bop. Their performance of Ornette Coleman's "Lonely Woman" 
perfectly captures the song's essence of timeworn sadness. The only thing 
missing is the resonant undercurrent of a strong bass line (Charlie Haden would 
sound terrific with this group). 
</P>
<P>
LOREN PICKFORD 
</P>
<P>
"Song For A Blue Planet" 
</P>
<P>
Despite the New Age-sounding title, alto saxophonist Pickford's album is pure 
mainstream jazz. Accompanied by a strong supporting cast that includes George 
Roessler on guitar, George Cables on piano, John Heard on bass and Billy 
Higgins on drums, Pickford applies his warm-toned instrument to a set of golden 
standards ("Skylark"; "Alone Together") and originals. 
</P>
<P>
CHIZ HARRIS 
</P>
<P>
"Confirmation" 
</P>
<P>
A straight-ahead blowing session, recorded "live" in the studio with an 
audience. Drummer Harris, a longtime Orange County jazz figure, leads a group 
that includes saxophonist Jay Migliori, pianist Joe Lettieri and bassist Isla 
Eckinger. Guest trumpeter-fluegelhornist Conte Candoli provides added spice to 
steaming, be-bop brew. 
</P>
<P>
Other current Cexton releases include: "Leap of Faith" from Rob Silvan and the 
eclectic vocal scat singing of Fine Line; "Spirit of Light," a pop-jazz 
collection from a group called Axiom; and "This Was Meant To Be," featuring the 
original songs of singer Barbara Reed. Scheduled for release in the next few 
months are albums from trombonist Mike Fahn and guitarist Robert Conti. DON
