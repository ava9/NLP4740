New to her Ventura neighborhood, Nena Doyle was playing it safe this Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
After her daughter, Deanna, made her trick-or-treat rounds, the pair stopped by 
the Community Memorial Hospital of San Buenaventura to have the goodies 
X-rayed. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a child in my class whose cousin got his throat cut on a piece of 
Halloween candy," said Doyle, a fifth-grade teacher at E.P. Foster Elementary 
in Ventura. "It really motivated me to have her candy checked out." 
</P>
<P>
Deanna, 8, dressed as a ballerina, added, "They X-ray the candy so we can see 
if it has any razor blades." Her candy checked out fine. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night marked the seventh year that the hospital has X-rayed Halloween 
candy to detect metallic objects. The free X-ray, which takes from 15 to 30 
seconds per bag of candy, requires very minimal radiation exposure, hospital 
representatives said. 
</P>
<P>
"An X-ray can't detect poison or glass. X-raying the candy doesn't absolve the 
parents from their responsibility to really check the candy," said Suzanne 
Brockman, director of marketing for the hospital, who added that it is 
difficult for an X-ray to detect foreign objects in foil-wrapped candy. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital gave 9,000 trick-or-treat bags to the Ventura Unified School 
District, which distributed them to elementary school children earlier this 
month. Each bag contained a parental consent form absolving the hospital from 
liability if candy that had been tampered with went undetected. 
</P>
<P>
With her four costumed children in tow, Donna Jaco visited the hospital for the 
annual candy X-ray. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be sure it's safe to eat," said Jaco, a nurse at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula Memorial Hospital also X-rayed candy Halloween night. The hospital 
also requires a parental consent form. STEPHANIE STASSEL
