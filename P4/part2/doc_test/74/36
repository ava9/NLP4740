Tone Loc's got nothing to worry about. At least not from trombonist Wayne 
Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
In his show-closing set Saturday at the Long Beach Jazz Festival -- held next 
to the Rainbow Lagoon near the Long Beach Convention Center -- Henderson, the 
former Crusader and leader here of a slightly over-hyped group of musicians 
dubbed "Master Collection," rapped his way through a new tune entitled "Just 
Because It's Jazz Don't Mean You Can't Dance." Though the husky-voiced 
Henderson's delivery was less than prime, a good part of the crowd, generously 
estimated by festival personnel at 9,000, took the lyric to heart, moving into 
the aisles and in front of the stage to shimmy and shake. 
</P>
<P>
The tune made an appropriate theme song for the 3-day event that opened Friday 
night with keyboardist Bobby Lyle, message-conscious vocalist Gil Scott-Heron 
and pop singer Phyllis Hyman, and continued Sunday in a more traditional vein 
with a scheduled program that included cornetist Nat Adderley, pianist McCoy 
Tyner and Latin-jazz-band leader Poncho Sanchez. But, on Saturday, just because 
you heard it at the jazz festival didn't necessarily make it jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Perspective on the label-stretching fest came early-on from singer Dakota 
Staton, who delivered a vivacious set of standards and blues backed by the 
competent trio of pianist Bross Townsend, bassist Isla Eckinger and drummer 
Jack Ranelli. The singer -- who made the pop charts a number of times in the 
late '50s -- showed strength and conviction while utilizing a minimum of 
stylistic gimmicks in her renditions of such familiar numbers as "Misty," "The 
Thrill Is Gone" and "Love for Sale," on which she injected vocal octave jumps 
in a way that recalled the late Billy Holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Sandwiched between Staton and Henderson was a mixed-bag of pop, funk and 
fusion. Vibist Roy Ayers, who now plays a compact, electronic version of the 
instrument, gave an uneven, backbeat-laden performance (with bass supplied by a 
keyboard) that contained too much of Ayers' vocal antics and too little of his 
mallet work. The Rippingtons, featuring guitarist Russ Freeman, enlivened their 
mostly bland compositions with Steve Reid's percussion embellishments and Mark 
Portman's synthesizer wash. 
</P>
<P>
A satisfying set from pianist Ramsey Lewis was marred by a loss of sound during 
a dramatic guitar solo from quintet member Henry Johnson and by the explosions 
of the nightly fireworks launched from the nearby Queen Mary. Lewis' funky 
block-chord style remains intact, and the keyboardist worked some ambitious Art 
Tatum-style flourishes as well into Stevie Wonder's "Living for the City." And, 
yes, the keyboardist did "Wade in the Water." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Henderson's attempt at rap, the Master Collection's short 
R&amp;B-infused closing set was solid in a way that recalled its leader's days 
in the old Jazz Crusaders. Central to this success was Alphonse Mouzon's crisp, 
inventive drumming, Kirk Whalum's blowzy tenor sax work and Henderson's own 
burnished trombone tones.

Also appearing Saturday were saxophonist Hank Crawford and the Yellowjackets 
(reviewed last Monday.
