Billy Taylor's position as one of the most respected figures in jazz is hard to 
dispute. With a long list of musical and academic achievements, as well as his 
high visibility on CBS' "Sunday Morning" show, he may be one of the best-known 
jazz musicians in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's opening night set at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, however, raised the 
question of whether the pianist's peripatetic schedule has begun to blur his 
musical focus. The words that kept coming to mind throughout a mixed bag of 
standards and blues were controlled, slick, smooth and mannered. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor has never been a particularly passionate player, but the emotional 
energy of his solos was even more diminished than usual. It was not until he 
reached a closing set of variations on "All The Things You Are" that his 
precise, scale-based playing began to generate any real heat. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier numbers aroused interest primarily for their often novel 
interpretations. " 'A' Train," for example, was driven through a long tunnel 
full of eerie harmonies before it emerged into a loose, pleasant swing. The 
first chorus of "Body and Soul" received a virtuosic, left-hand-only reading 
that would have been more effective had Taylor had fewer problems with his 
digital articulation. 
</P>
<P>
Ballads like "More Than You Know" seemed to trigger the best playing, in part 
because of the smooth carpet of rhythm laid down by bassist Victor Gaskin and 
drummer Bobby Thomas. Gaskin's few solo moments were highlighted by some 
startling, double-stop pizzicato lines, and Thomas's feature on "Caravan" 
dramatically displayed the variety of textures that can be derived from a basic 
drum set by a gifted player. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's long history of contributions to jazz demands respect and support. It 
may be too much to expect his playing to probe a bit deeper, and risk a little 
more. Yet Taylor is good enough and creative enough to keep that wish alive. On 
this night, at least, it was unfulfilled. DON HECKMAN
