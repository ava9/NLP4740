Records were not the only things to fall on the third day of the NCAA Division 
II swimming and diving championships at State University of New York, Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
So did the hopes of all but two teams. 
</P>
<P>
Swimmers from teams other than Cal State Northridge and Cal State Bakersfield 
can concentrate on individual achievements today, the meet's last day. 
</P>
<P>
The team championships virtually have been decided. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge holds a commanding 280-217 lead over second-place North Dakota State 
in the women's standings, and some of the Lady Matadors' strongest events 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield, in quest of its fourth consecutive men's title, has an even bigger 
lead, 422-314, over Oakland University (Mich.). Northridge is in seventh place 
with 104 points. 
</P>
<P>
Six Division II records were set Friday, including two by the Northridge 
women's team, which is seeking its third championship in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matador team of Jude Kylander, Stacey Mettam, Michelle Sulak and Toady 
Kimble started the night with a 1:34.83 effort in the 200-yard freestyle relay. 
That broke the previous Division II standard of 1:35.58 set by North Dakota in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
It was Mettam's 23.6 split on the second leg that put CSUN into the record 
book. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea where that came from," said the senior, who was competing in a 
freestyle relay for the first time. Mettam's specialty is the backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, a legitimate sprinter, brought the Lady Matadors home with a time of 
23.1 over the final 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Mettam and Kylander were also members of a CSUN team that broke the 400-yard 
medley relay record with a time of 3:52.64 in the last event of the night. The 
previous mark was 3:54.17 set by Northridge last year. 
</P>
<P>
Kylander swam an especially impressive 51.14 freestyle portion on the relay. 
Mettam turned in a 58.7 in the backstroke, followed by Tina Schnare (1:04.63 in 
the breaststroke) and Tina Dodson (58.17 in the butterfly). 
</P>
<P>
Other records were set in the men's 200-yard freestyle relay (Oakland, 
1:22.46); men's 400-yard medley relay (Oakland, 3:21.55); women's 400-yard 
individual medley (Ann Wycoff of Army, 4:30.72); and the men's 400-yard 
individual medley (Andrew Shattuck of Bakersfield, 3:57.73). 
</P>
<P>
Among other highlights for the Northridge women's team was a high-scoring 
finish in the 200-yard freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Kylander finished second in a personal-best 1:52.52. She was followed closely 
by teammate Jeanna Giessinger, third in 1:53.32. Michelle Sulak of CSUN won the 
event's consolation championship in 1:53.99. 
</P>
<P>
Schnare can tie Wycoff, who swam her final event of the meet Friday -- for 
career individual titles (eight) with a victory in the 200-yard breaststroke 
today. Schnare, the top qualifier by more than two seconds, is also the 
Division II record-holder in the event. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's competition, Northridge junior Ted Hollahan failed to successfully 
defend his championship in the 200-yard freestyle, finishing second in 1:38.71. 
Hilton Woods, a sophomore from Oakland, came from half a body length behind in 
the last 50 yards to out-touch Hollahan in 1:38.35. 
</P>
<P>
Hollahan will have a chance to redeem himself against Woods -- who also 
defeated him in the 50-yard freestyle -- in the 100-yard race today. 
</P>
<P>
Hollahan won the event last year in a record-setting time of 44.65. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened tonight might be the best thing for me," Hollahan said. "Now 
I'll be shooting at someone again instead of everyone shooting at me."
