<F P=106> [Nikolay Modestov report: "A Unique Incident -- So Declared </F>
Russian First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets at a Press Conference 
Held After the Release of the Hostages"] 
  [Excerpts] The situation's uniqueness consisted not only in 
the technical parameters of the helicopter, which were unusual 
for this type of crime -- the single entrance door to the craft, 
the maneuverability in flight, the cramped and enclosed nature 
of the cabin -- but also in the large number of schoolchildren 
seized by the terrorists, and the professionalism of one of the 
bandits (who was a former military pilot), as well as the degree 
to which the criminals were armed, and their aggressiveness. 
[passage omitted] Suffice it to say that the gang's ringleader 
has three criminal convictions, and one of its members was tried 
for rape. Oleg Soskovets also noted the courage and endurance of 
the pilots. 
  The main responsibility for dealing with the gang lay with 
those subordinate to First Deputy Internal Affairs Minister 
Mikhail Yegorov. However, all the heads of oblasts and the 
rayons in the North Caucasus, even of those regions where a 
state of emergency is currently in force, took part in resolving 
the situation. [passage omitted]
