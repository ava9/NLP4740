WHEN NINO Ivanishvili was 18 and studying English at the University of
Tiblisi, she spent her summer vacation in an isolated village high in the
Caucasus mountains. It was here, one sunny afternoon, that she was kidnapped
by a young man driven half-mad by the sight of her bathing in a nearby
mountain stream. Without knowing it, throughout the summer Nino had been
under the constant observation of the son of one of the peasant families in
the village, a young man of few words and strong passions. Normally she
would have been safe from such attentions, for the code of social conduct in
these mountains is strong. But this is also an area of fierce and enduring
blood feuds. The fact that Nino was the guest of a family engaged in a
vendetta with the young man's family made her fair game and an object worthy
of theft. Had it not been that Nino's screams were heard by her hosts as the
young man threw her on to a horse and galloped into the hills, Nino today
might be a mountain man's unwilling wife rather than a professional
translator. A mounted chase ensued, rifle fire was exchanged, and the young
man eventually relinquished his prize and retreated. Nino subsequently made
a rapid return to the city. 'What is the name of the place where this
happened?', I asked Nino when she had finished telling me this story one
afternoon not long ago. We were sitting in a gloomy restaurant off an
exhaust-choked street in Tiblisi. For months the Georgian capital had been
an unhappy place, beset by political violence, shortages and insecurity. But
up above the level of the street, over the smog and strained faces, I could
see a serene blue sky, and imagined it set against snow and high mountain
passes.
'It is called Svaneti', she replied. 'It is far into the Caucasus, and very
difficult to get to. There probably isn't even enough petrol available these
days to get there.'
Immediately I wanted to go to Svaneti, and persuaded Nino to take me there,
petrol or no petrol. Anywhere where such reckless, medieval robbery could
still take place must, I reasoned, be well worth a visit.
Svaneti, in the high Caucasus of north-western Georgia, is indeed a remote
and inaccessible area, and it took us 14 spine-jarring hours in a
Russian-built jeep to get there. We were not the first to go by motorised
vehicle - rough, unpaved roads first began replacing mountain trails there
in the late 1930s - but Svaneti continues to be four-wheel-drive country,
the wildest and least developed region in the trans-Caucasus.
In fact, what little I had been able to pick up about the Svans, a proud and
fiercely independent people with a reputation for violence, left me hoping
that 50 years of socialism had at least had some calming effect on their
character.
Certainly pre-communist Svans had little liking for outsiders. In the late
19th century, I learned, Puta Dadeshkeliani, a feudal lord from the Georgian
lowlands, foolishly tried to extend his influence into Svaneti. The Svans
invited him to a meeting in front of one of their churches, whereupon the
entire congregation helped pull a string attached to the trigger of a rifle,
thus giving each present the pleasure of killing the intruder.
Perhaps the Svans had been right to resist foreign intrusion; Soviet
socialism has left ugly traces on the face of Georgia. Heading westward over
the plains towards the Black Sea, we drove past factories where chimneys
belched toxic green smoke on to adjacent vineyards, past concrete housing
developments hunkering in the middle of vegetable plots, past state
co-operatives where cannibalised tractors and farm machinery littered the
fields.
But communism has had a tougher time making marks on one of the world's
great mountain ranges. From the sub-tropical plantation town of Zugdidi,
near the Black Sea coast, we saw the Caucasus rise with little warning, dark
and massive, above citrus groves and long alleys of tea bushes. Half-an-hour
later we were into the hills, and had left the world of socialist
reconstruction behind.
This is a wild, rough land. The higher we climbed, the more rugged and
unfinished-looking the mountains became. 15,000 ft summits left the road in
shadow. Boulders the size of houses were strewn through river valleys. Great
chunks of fallen mountainside sat battered and raw at the bottom of deep
canyons. Wherever wide swathes of pine forest had been knocked down by
avalanches, bare rock and torn soil lay exposed. In the Caucasus, it seems
as if the work of creation is still in process.
Even the people we passed had a rough, primitive air. Riding stocky
Caucasian ponies, their bristly, unshaven faces surmounted by caps of brown
felt, the men looked like brigands. Their women, dressed in black woollen
skirts, trudged along the roadside bent double under the weight of heavy
backpacks. Some of the locals, apparently, had not even discovered the
wheel, or at least disdained its use - they were dragging tons of firewood
along the muddy road on sleds of heavy wooden runners.
'What are those shrines?', I shouted to Nino as the jeep bucketed round
hairpin bends under the direction of Otar, our maniacal Georgian driver. I
pointed to a curious roadside construction, something like a telephone box,
where inside, on a little shelf, I could see a framed photo, flowers, a
bottle and two glasses.
'They mark places where people have been killed in road accidents', Nino
shouted back. 'When friends or family pass by, they stop and toast the dead
with a drink.' Judging by the number of shrines and empty bottles piled
beside them, crashing cars and toasting the dead are equally popular
activities in these mountains.
Upwards through the Svan homeland we drove, until we could drive no further,
and stopped at Ushguli. At 7,200 ft it is the highest permanently inhabited
village in Europe, and feels like the end of the earth.
The 19th century English traveller Douglas Freshfield described the Svans as
'the most savage and dangerous-looking set of people I have ever come
across.' Entering Svan villages, he encountered inhabitants who, 'yelling
and jabbering, barred the way, while others brandished swords, daggers and
pistols.'
But unlike Puta Dadeshkeliani or Douglas Freshfield, we skidded up through
the manure-sodden lanes of Ushguli unarmed and without hostile intent. In
return, the villagers brandished nothing at us but smiles. In no time at all
we were comfortably installed in a kitchen full of the odours of good things
cooking, and warming ourselves with the help of a cast-iron stove and
glasses of mead made from alpine honey. Our host, Kolia Nijaradze, may have
looked like a wild-eyed bandit, but a rough demeanour hid only a gentle
cattle farmer.
Perhaps it is their demanding environment that makes the Svans look so
tough. Winters in Svaneti last eight months, with temperatures often dipping
below -30`C. Snowfalls are extremely heavy. When a Svanetian tells you he is
frequently cut off from the outside world, he does not merely mean that the
roads are blocked, but that he cannot get out of his front door. Snow is
sometimes so deep that the houses of Ushguli disappear entirely.
In times like these, and when avalanches roar down the slopes of the
surrounding mountains, Svanetians retreat to their 100-ft watchtowers. Built
in the middle ages of granite and slate, the strength of the watchtowers
remains something of a mystery. Russian chemical engineers analysing the
composition of Svaneti mortar claim egg yolk was an essential ingredient.
But Soviet science was never able to explain how the Svans managed to amass
enough eggs to build over 60 of these tall towers. Now it never will.
But if the Svans lead a rigorous life in their mountain fastness, their
isolation has given them a special attitude to the rare visitors who do
happen by. Caucasian medieval tradition has it that guests come from God,
and should be treated accordingly. If family feuding ranks high in the
Caucasian code of honour, generosity, friendship and hospitality towards
strangers ranks even higher. The only real danger a visitor to Svaneti runs
is cholesterol over-dose from the food and drink with which he is plied from
morning to night.
The sun shone, the birds sang, the snow above us glittered in the thin
mountain air. Nino, Otar and I wandered among the cows and goats scattered
on the alpine pastures surrounding the village. We climbed watchtowers and
visited the church where Puta Dadeshkeliani came to a sticky end. We gorged
ourselves on a suckling pig killed in our honour. We listened to stories
about bear hunting, mountain trout fishing and killer avalanches. We were
toasted in vodka that ran like water. We sang Georgian counterpoint in
three-part harmony.
We did, in fact, just about everything that pleased us, with one exception.
When Otar and I suggested a swim in the clear mountain stream that ran
through the hills not far from the village, Nino, for reasons of her own,
declined to join us.
