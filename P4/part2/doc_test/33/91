  [Text] Beijing, June 25 (CNS) -- Rain has been scarce in 
most parts of northern China since early June, and drought is 
now growing more serious. The average rainfall in the northern 
area of the Huaihe River is less than 10 millimetres. 
Shangdong, Henan and Inner Mongolia have seen not a single drop 
of rain since then. 
  According to the office of the Flood Prevention and Drought 
Combat Headquarters, due to scarcity of rain and high 
temperature, water contained in soil has evaporated fast. At 
present, drought in Shangdong, the northern part of Huaibei, 
most part of Huabei and Northeast spreads quickly. The size of 
drought-hit area in northern China is estimated to be 230 
million mu of land. Many rivers have dried up, water storage in 
reservoirs has dwindled. This has seriously affected crops and 
summer sowing. More than 12 million people and 12 million 
domestic animals are short of drinking water. [paragraph as 
published] 
  According to the Central Weather Broadcasting Centre, since 
early June there has been consecutive days of high temperature 
in most parts of Huabei, Northeast and Shangdong, the 
temperature is two to three degrees centigrade higher on average 
than in normal years. Temperatures in these areas are usually 
around 30 degrees centigrade, and in certain areas the highest 
reaching 37 degrees. This further worsens the situation of 
drought. However, adequate heat is most helpful to the growth 
of crops in areas where water is plenty. The hot weather is 
also beneficial to the harvest of winter wheat.
