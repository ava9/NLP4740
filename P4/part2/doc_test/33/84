<P>
The most dire predictions about global warming are being toned down by many 
experts, who now predict that temperatures and sea levels in the next century 
will not rise as dramatically as once feared. 
</P>
<P>
While climate researchers tend to agree that our grandchildren will inherit a 
warmer world, many scientists are now betting on an average warming of only 
three or four degrees Fahrenheit by the middle of the next century, the low end 
of a range that prognosticators once put as high as nine degrees. 
</P>
<P>
A rise in sea level, one of the most feared consequences of global warming, 
also is expected to be far less drastic than previously thought, largely 
because of the surprising observation that the polar ice sheets are not 
melting, but growing in size. According to Mark Meier of the Institute of 
Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado, the consensus now is 
that sea level will rise by about a foot in the next century, rather than the 
three feet that had been suggested in previous studies. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the revised forecast is correct, there would be major effects, the 
scientists warn. A one-foot rise in sea level would inundate some shorelines, 
moving the water's edge inland by hundreds or thousands of feet. And a global 
warming of only a few degrees might upset communities of plants and animals 
that have developed over millennia. Weather patterns also could change, meaning 
more frequent droughts and severe storms. 
</P>
<P>
Yet along with the new forecasts are indications that not all changes will be 
bad. Some researchers have begun to stress that a warmer, wetter world might be 
welcome in some regions. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an interesting point that people ought to think about more. By and 
large, there are positive effects. More wheat in the Ukraine. Thinner ice in 
the Arctic. Better winters in Moscow. But at the same time, you're building up 
a bigger time bomb that is becoming harder and harder to dismantle," said John 
Perry, staff director of the Board of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate at the 
National Research Council. 
</P>
<P>
Perry points to a recent study by the climate office of National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration that concluded that a slightly warmer, wetter world 
would increase food production, enhance forest growth and enlarge water 
supplies. An obvious drawback was that billions of dollars would have to be 
spent protecting coastal areas from rising seas. 
</P>
<P>
The great uncertainty in predicting global warming and its effects is making 
life difficult for government policy-makers. The computer models upon which all 
forecasts are based are generated by a small group of scientists who 
acknowledge that they do not understand or even recognize all the variables 
that affect their predictions, thus compounding policy uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
"The things we can say with confidence, the policy-makers are not interested 
in. And the things the policy-makers are interested in, we don't know with much 
confidence," said Jerry Mahlman, director of NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics 
Laboratory at Princeton University. 
</P>
<P>
"Modelers have been thrust into the limelight way too soon," said Richard 
Cooper, an economist at Harvard University. "They don't have models today you 
can build public policy on." 
</P>
<P>
The frustration was evident at a meeting Cooper and Mahlman attended recently 
at the National Academy of Sciences, where an expert panel was grappling with 
the policy implications of global warming. After a long afternoon, during which 
the invited scientists displayed graphs with past and future temperatures 
bouncing up and down like rubber balls, they were finally begged to put aside 
the carefully hedged forecasts and simply make a "best guess." While the ranges 
of guesses varied, the favorite seemed to be a four-degree increase by the 
middle of the next century, when concentrations of carbon dioxide gas -- which 
contributes to the "greenhouse effect" -- are expected to double. 
</P>
<P>
One reason many researchers are shying away from the worst-case scenarios so 
popular a year ago has to do with the climate record itself. While researchers 
argue that the oldest records are highly suspect, in general they agree that 
temperatures have risen over the past 100 years by about a degree. But there 
are tremendous arguments over whether or not this increase is due to an 
accumulation of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, which trap 
heat close to Earth. Instead it may be the result of some other climatic cycle 
unrelated to human activity. But whatever its cause, the temperature record is 
more consistent with a rise of four degrees, rather than nine degrees, by the 
middle of the next century. 
</P>
<P>
"The new runs do favor the lower estimate," said Warren Washington of the 
National Center for Atmospheric Research, another top climate modeler. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the most recent climate simulations, done by the National Center for 
Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab 
at Princeton, suggest slightly lower temperature increases, according to the 
scientists who run them. 
</P>
<P>
Both models showed uneven warming in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. In 
one run, the region around the Southern Ocean that surrounds Antarctica did not 
warm at all. The model showed it cooling, thanks to improved simulations of how 
the ocean currents circulate and mix. Another world-class model, run by the 
United Kingdom Meteorological Office, cuts temperature rises in half when the 
researchers change the way raindrops are represented. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not all the climate modelers agree with the lower estimates. One is 
James Hansen of National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard 
Institute for Space Studies in New York. Hansen said he thinks his model and 
the observed temperature record are still in keeping with a greater future 
increase in temperatures. At the meeting at the National Academy of Sciences, 
Hansen stated again that he thinks warming associated with increased greenhouse 
gases has already begun and that the Earth will warm by more than four degrees 
on average in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
All the modelers stress how uncertain the forecasts are. "People are hedging," 
Washington said. "You get put into a defensive position, because everyone wants 
the lower estimates." 
</P>
<P>
Given all the uncertainties, what is known for sure? It is agreed that carbon 
dioxide has increased over the last 100 years. Since 1958, when accurate 
surveys were begun, carbon dioxide has increased from 316 parts per million 
parts of air to 353 parts per million today, an 11% increase. This accumulation 
is attributed primarily to the burning of fossil fuels, of which the United 
States is the largest user. 
</P>
<P>
The basic phenomena of the greenhouse effect are also agreed upon. It has been 
operating for millions of years and is one reason Earth is as warm as it is. In 
the last few months, the greenhouse effect was actually measured for the first 
time by University of Chicago researchers who used satellites to measure 
radiation coming into the atmosphere and bouncing back out to space. 
</P>
<P>
So it is almost universally agreed that Earth probably will warm as carbon 
dioxide and other greenhouse gases accumulate. How much it warms is the 
question. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Lindzen, one of the most outspoken critics of current projections, 
conceded at the recent meeting that temperatures probably will rise, but not by 
much. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor said he thinks the 
planet will respond to the buildup of greenhouse gases by producing "negative 
feedbacks," such as high, dry clouds, that will lift warmed air from the ground 
toward the upper atmosphere where its heat will radiate into space, 
counteracting a warming trend. 
</P>
<P>
But researchers tend to think that while Hansen's projections may be too hot, 
Lindzen's are definitely too cold. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers say it may take another decade or more to settle the issues. At 
present, the most common response by government officials and scientists has 
been a call for more research and a push to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide 
by increasing energy efficiency -- a painless remedy that would provide 
benefits regardless of future temperatures.
