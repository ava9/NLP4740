An unexpected, wintry rainstorm swept through Southern California on Monday, 
dumping record rainfall that unleashed mudslides and caught Memorial Day 
celebrants unprepared and underdressed. 
</P>
<P>
The morning storm dropped more than an inch of rain in some places, washing out 
camping, picnicking and sun bathing and forcing organizers of a variety of 
Memorial Day observances to alter their programs or cancel them altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't see it coming down so far with such intensity," said Steve Burback, 
a spokesman for WeatherData Inc., which provides weather information for The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Burback said the storm originated in the Gulf of Alaska and moved into Southern 
California at about 3:30 a.m., bringing with it below-normal temperatures and 
record amounts of rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, San Juan Capistrano received the most rainfall, collecting 
more than 1.5 inches, while Santiago and Modjeska peaks received 1.4 inches, 
Burback said. 
</P>
<P>
The high temperature in Santa Ana was 67 -- about 10 degrees cooler than normal 
for this time of year, Burback said. 
</P>
<P>
National Weather Service spokesman Jerry Steiger said that total rainfall in 
Santa Ana measured 0.52 inches and Anaheim experienced a third of an inch of 
rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
Burback said a general clearing with scattered high clouds began Monday 
afternoon and was expected to continue through today. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown Los Angeles, 1.17 inches of rain fell -- a breakaway record, since 
the best any previous Memorial Day could muster was 0.12 of an inch. "It's 
acting more like wintertime," Burback said. Snow that measured as much as four 
inches at Big Bear melted when it hit the ground elsewhere in the mountains, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
None of this put much of a dent in the drought: For example, while the 1.17 
inches brought Los Angeles' monthly total to 1.20 inches, this year's rainfall 
so far amounts to 7.38 inches, not quite half of the normal 14.82 inches. 
</P>
<P>
But the quenching rain at the same time dampened Memorial observances. 
</P>
<P>
For 25 consecutive years, Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Cypress has remembered 
the thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who died in war. But 
persistent rainfall Monday morning caused mortuary officials to cancel the 11 
a.m. service, manager Darren Drabing said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all very disappointed that we had to break it off," Drabing said. 
</P>
<P>
In Fullerton, however, the Loma Vista Memorial Park observance was held in 
spite of a steady drizzle. Cemetery spokeswoman Sharon Adams said the ceremony 
lacked only the 500 large American flags that were to line the main entrance to 
the memorial park. 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 people huddled under umbrellas and white canopies to listen to 
Maj. Gen. Norris Einerston, chief chaplain of the Army, deliver a somber 
address, Adams said. Small flags and crosses were then placed on the graves of 
about 3,000 veterans buried in Loma Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the county, beaches, campgrounds and parks were mostly empty as the 
thick cloud cover and occasional downpour forced a mass exodus to warmer and 
drier activities. 
</P>
<P>
The pre-summer holiday, normally marked by sun worshiping and other outdoor 
activities, was the bleakest in memory. 
</P>
<P>
"I got only one color for you out here. That's gray," Newport Beach lifeguard 
Jim Turner said of the dismal day that looked more like mid-January than the 
start of beach season. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-morning, the only sign of life in the normally crowded beach resort was 
on the Newport Pier, where disappointed beach-goers wrapped in sweat shirts, 
jackets and blankets forlornly watched the surf. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Turner said, more than 90,000 people flocked to Newport Beach on 
Sunday. But with winds reaching 25 m.p.h. on Monday, Turner said, air 
temperatures dipped to about 48 degrees, and not a soul could be spotted on the 
stretches of sand. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the die-hards are gone," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
Camper Dick Cliver, however, counted himself as a die-hard, deciding to stick 
out his San Clemente beach vacation despite chilling temperatures, soggy 
clothes and a damp tent. 
</P>
<P>
"We found out that the tent leaked and so does the camper," said Cliver, 
sitting in an eight-foot camper atop a pickup truck at San Clemente State 
Beach. Nearby, dozens of footprints in the soft mud led to a huge nylon tent 
filled with the soaked belongings of family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not driving us out," said Cliver, a Buena Park resident. "We'll just 
sit in here and watch it rain if we have to." 
</P>
<P>
Carl and Lindy Spencer and their two children, who drove all night in the rain 
from Las Vegas, spent the first part of a week's vacation at Doheny coping with 
flooded campgrounds and the downpour. 
</P>
<P>
They managed to erect two nylon tents and tied a clothesline from their car to 
a nearby tree to dry out drenched clothes and towels. 
</P>
<P>
Interstate 5 was hit hard early in the morning, with flooding causing closures 
along the freeway at Junipero Serra Road in San Juan Capistrano and Red Hill 
Avenue in Tustin, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP was also kept busy rushing to the scenes of more than a dozen traffic 
accidents that slowed highways to a crawl in many areas. They attributed the 
majority of accidents to slick roads. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally on the first day (of rain), it's the craziest," said CHP Officer 
Bryan Duquesnel. "They are just cranking on down the road and don't pay 
attention (to water hazards)." 
</P>
<P>
A stretch of Dana Point Harbor Road leading to the Dana Point Marine Institute 
and a residential road near the intersection of Street of the Golden Lantern 
and Camino del Avion in Laguna Niguel were closed temporarily due to mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
"The water and the mud were up to my knees," said County Harbors Beaches and 
Parks worker Brian Young as he worked to clear Dana Point Harbor Road, which 
leads to the Dana Point Marine Institute. "It was a pretty big slide. 
</P>
<P>
As the rain subsided later in the afternoon, thousands of Orange County 
residents had changed their outdoor plans and opted to flock to area malls 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been busy like mad," said Mona Salameh, an employee at the May Co. 
department store in South Coast Plaza. "I went out into the mall and it's the 
busiest I've seen it since Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, Memorial Day draws a fair amount of shoppers because many stores 
advertise sale prices and stay open longer hours, but today was exceptionally 
busy because of inclement weather, Salameh said.
