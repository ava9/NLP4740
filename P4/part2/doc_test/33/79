Now that weekend picnics and holiday get-togethers have been ruined by drizzle 
and clouds, it looks like the weather will clear up just in time for another 
workweek. 
</P>
<P>
The recent storm that passed through San Diego County should be just a memory 
by this morning, according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
Sunnier skies and warmer temperatures are on tap for the rest of the week, 
forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
The showers that lingered in the mountains and inland valleys Sunday evening 
will be gone today, leaving only a few chilly gusts of wind and high clouds 
throughout the county, forecaster Wally Segiel said. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in downtown San Diego will be about 69 degrees today, with 
nighttime lows in the 50s, Segiel said.

Warming Trend 
</P>
<P>
There will be more clearing and warmer temperatures Tuesday and throughout the 
rest of the week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend storm dropped .63 inches of rain on San Diego, bringing the total 
rainfall for the season to 5.43 inches -- still 2.58 inches short of the normal 
seasonal rainfall, according to weather service statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The heaviest rainfall was in the mountains, with Palomar Mountain reporting 
4.20 inches of rain and Julian measuring 3 inches, since the storm began 
Saturday morning, Segiel said. 
</P>
<P>
Campo, Escondido and Poway each reported at least an inch of rain, with lesser 
amounts falling in coastal areas. 
</P>
<P>
The relatively mild storm provided "a good drenching," but there were no 
reported damages, Segiel said.
