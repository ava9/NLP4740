Along U.S. 101 near the Ventura-Santa Barbara county line lies a small tropical 
paradise that for years has astonished weather analysts and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Tucked between the ocean and 300-foot-high bluffs is a place called La 
Conchita, a seaside community that is also the home of the only commercial 
banana plantation in the continental United States, according to the 
International Banana Assn. 
</P>
<P>
There, 10,000 banana trees are fanned by balmy ocean breezes, basking in an 
island of frost-free weather. When Ventura freezes over, the Seaside Banana 
Farm is frost-free. When Santa Barbara shivers, bananas at the 12-acre 
plantation ripen on the stalk. 
</P>
<P>
One of the managers of the tiny banana republic is Doug Richardson, 41, an 
occasional landscaper who began cultivating bananas six years ago as an 
experiment in his front yard. He found the banana plants he was growing for 
ground cover actually were producing tasty fruit. In 1985, he decided to grow 
them commercially. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson said that up until then, growing bananas "was unheard of in this 
state." 
</P>
<P>
A geography major at UC Santa Barbara, Richardson researched temperatures in 
countries where bananas are grown. 
</P>
<P>
"What I discovered is that we have a unique climate here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During the next few months of summer, the plantation will enjoy hothouse 
temperatures hovering between 85 and 95 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson's partner, Paul Turner, 43, said he was a skeptical at first. But 
old-timers told him they had never seen a frost in La Conchita. Then he learned 
that the plantation has higher temperatures than the Canary Islands off the 
coast of Africa. "I figured that if they can do it there, we could do it too," 
Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
The farm produces 10 to 20 tons of bananas per acre every year, compared to 25 
to 30 tons on other plantations. Two years ago, the two were quoted as saying 
that they hoped to gross about $200,000. But today Richardson and Turner are 
more circumspect about what they garner from nearly a quarter of a million 
pounds of bananas sold every year. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural officials and other farmers acknowledged that the plantation is an 
environmental oddity. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to grow bananas on the Oxnard Plain and they froze," said Rob Brokaw, 
a grower who also specializes in rare and exotic fruits. 
</P>
<P>
The plantation does well in the winter because the ocean -- with its temperate 
currents only a few hundred yards away -- maintains a moderate temperature, 
said Bob Brendler, an adviser with University of California Cooperative 
Extension. 
</P>
<P>
The moderate air coming off the ocean moves up the area's steep slopes, 
breaking up any stagnant, freezing air. In summer, ocean breezes bathe the area 
with cool, humid air, mimicking the climate of the tropics. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson and Turner admit that their La Conchita plantation is not the only 
hot spot in the county. Bananas are grown in Carpinteria, about five miles 
away, but the crop is much smaller. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Moore, top banana of the International Banana Assn., called the farm a 
"climatic nonconformity." 
</P>
<P>
Banana plantations usually are located in subtropical climates where the 
temperatures rarely dip below 55 degrees, Moore said. Banana farming was 
previously thought impossible in California, away from the porous volcanic soil 
that plants favor, he said. But Seaside Banana Farm has changed his mind. "It's 
a very unusual spot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the farm's success goes beyond climatological luck. The farm requires 
intensive care. Instead of relying on tropical rainfall, the two farmers 
planted drought-resistant banana tubers and lined the groves with black 
irrigation pipes. 
</P>
<P>
Every stalk of bananas is covered with a blue plastic bag to speed the ripening 
process and prevent damage from leaves. Each banana tree is hand-cultivated by 
a hired crew of six workers and small trees are placed in pots. 
</P>
<P>
At $1 to $4 a pound, the bananas are not cheap. They are sold to organic food 
stores and pricey restaurants across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson and Turner say that one of their plans is to turn the plantation 
into a roadside attraction where a guide would conduct 20-minute tours through 
the groves, explaining the origin of banana plants. 
</P>
<P>
But neither Richardson nor Turner want to turn their plantation into a tropical 
Knott's Berry Farm. "It could become an A-1 tourist trap," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're occupied in our farm," Richardson said. "We're just down and dirty 
farmers."
