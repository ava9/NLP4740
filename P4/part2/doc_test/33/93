Several areas of San Diego County were drenched Saturday -- Palomar Mountain 
received nearly 3 inches of rainfall -- but forecasters said the steady rain 
would be replaced by light showers today. 
</P>
<P>
Today's precipitation -- the last remnants of Saturday's storm front -- may 
ruin weekend plans, but forecasters say the rain is greatly needed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're way below normal for this time of the year," said Wally Cegiel, a 
forecaster with the National Weather Service. "We're getting much-needed rain." 
</P>
<P>
At this stage of the rain season, which runs from July 1 to June 30, San Diego 
County typically has received 7.96 inches of rain. But so far, only 5.31 inches 
of rain has fallen. 
</P>
<P>
For Monday, warmer, sunnier weather is expected to return. 
</P>
<P>
Today's morning showers are expected to yield a mere .25 inch of rain, but it 
would add to Saturday's substantial rainfall, Cegiel said. 
</P>
<P>
Most areas of the county received at least nearly .50 inch of rain: San Diego 
had .48, Oceanside .60, El Cajon .63 and Escondido .80. Julian received 1.2 
inches of rain, and Palomar was thoroughly doused with 2.75 inches. 
</P>
<P>
After the morning showers, temperatures today are expected to reach 62 to 67 
degrees along the coast and inland. Overnight temperatures should drop into the 
mid-50s coastal and high 40s inland. GENE YASUDA
