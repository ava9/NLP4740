  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday defended 
the country's right to allow an unofficial visit by Taiwanese 
President Li Teng-hui against criticism from Beijing. 
  Chuan said Thailand had the freedom to allow any visitor 
into 
the country. He reaffirmed the government's adherence to a 
"one-China" policy, but said Li had a right to make a private 
trip to Thailand. 
  " We should show principles in conducting our (foreign) 
policy. We have the absolute freedom to do so," he said. 
"Otherwise the Dalai Lama could not have visited Thailand." 
[passage omitted] 
  The Chinese ambassador to Thailand, Jin Guihua, on Monday 
delivered a protest note to the Foreign Ministry, warning 
Thailand not to approve Li's visit. [passage omitted] 
  The premier said previous exchange trips between Taiwanese 
and Thai officials and frequent trips by the private sector in 
the past were normal for countries with economic relations.
