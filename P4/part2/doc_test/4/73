The Japanese government was yesterday suffering diplomatic discomfiture over
the activities of a visiting senior Taiwanese official at the Asian games in
Hiroshima.
Five members of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party plan to meet Mr Hsu
Li Teh, Taiwan's deputy premier, in Tokyo today in defiance of party
instructions to shun all contact with him. The government wants to avoid
offending China, a powerful ally, market and investment destination.
The meeting, while deliberately smaller than the grand dinner the
pro-Taiwanese LDP politicians had originally planned, will anger China
despite the Japanese government's attempts to prevent sports and politics
from becoming entangled.
Japan cut official ties with Taiwan and opened relations with Beijing in
1972, implying acceptance of China's belief that Taiwan is still a
Chinese-owned province. But a significant pro-Taiwan movement remains in
Japanese national politics, making it uncomfortable for the government to
take clear sides between Taiwan and China.
In an attempt to prove to China that Japan does not condone official
contacts with Taiwan, Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP's president and Japanese
foreign minister, yesterday cancelled a trip to the Hiroshima games
scheduled for next weekend. Chinese government objections to a planned visit
to the games by Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui led to his last-minute
withdrawal and replacement by the deputy prime minister, who it was hoped
would take a low profile.
Mr Hsu rekindled the dispute over Japan's ambivalent attitude to Taiwan
yesterday by claiming in a newspaper interview his visit had 'a political
meaning'. A Japanese official accused him of a 'breach of promise'. Also,
China has objected to a social meeting between Mr Hsu and Japan's education
minister.
