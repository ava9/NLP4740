<F P=106> ["sm"-signed report: "Rexrodt Wants To Upgrade Taipei </F>
Politically, Too"] 
  [Excerpt] Taipei, 26 Apr -- After talks with leading 
politicians in Taipei, Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt sees 
"very good chances" for the export of the German high-speed 
train, Intercity Express [ICE], to Taiwan. 
  The parliament in Taipei wants to make a basic decision in 
the period between May and July on the construction of a 350-km 
high-speed link between the capital in the north of the island 
and the industrial town of Koahsiung in the south, which would 
cost $17 billion. 
  Not only the success of the Intercity Express in Germany and 
the advanced technology speak for the German system, but also 
the fact that a German consortium is offering a private 
financing and operating scheme in accordance with the wishes of 
the Taiwanese parliament. Under the leadership of the Daimler 
subsidiary AEG, the German enterprises are prepared to make a 
comprehensive technology transfer, so that the Taiwanese 
industry, too, will profit from this project. 
  Rexrodt also stressed Germany's interest in the export of 
air 
buses, of short-distance traffic systems for the conurbation 
centers of the island, and of power plants and energy supply 
systems. 
  Basically, the government is interested in an 
intensification 
of economic relations, the economics minister stated during his 
talks with State President Lee Teng-hui, Economics Minister 
Chiang, Transportation Minister Liu, and leading 
parliamentarians. 
  Rexrodt welcomed the plan to establish a Taiwan center in 
Frankfurt and promised German support for the Taipei 
Government's wish to rejoin the United Nations and to be 
accepted by the newly founded World Trade Organization. 
  The Chinese partners demanded that Taiwan be deleted from 
the 
"H list" for exports, which includes countries that need a 
special permit for the export of goods that can be used for 
military and civilian purposes. Rexrodt stressed that the 
Federal Government is currently considering reducing this list 
from 36 to 8-12 countries. 
  A decision will be made by the summer. The German economics 
minister promised his partners in Taiwan that he will examine 
whether the next of the FRG's Asian economic conferences can 
take place in Taipei in 1996. [passage omitted]
