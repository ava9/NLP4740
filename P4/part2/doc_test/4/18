FT  07 OCT 94 / Taipei puts its mouth where pleas and money used to be: A
new assertive approach to foreign relations is emerging
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At the opening ceremony of the Asian Games in Hiroshima this week, Taiwan
got the biggest ovation from the crowd as its delegation walked into the
arena.
It was a signal of a changing diplomatic game being played by the Taipei
government.
Taiwan, which was once content to plead its case for greater international
recognition merely through quiet lobbying, chequebook diplomacy and
full-page advertisements in international publications, was reaping some of
the first fruits of a quite different approach.
The humble, discreet, behind-the-scenes approach long used for fear of
arousing the wrath of China and causing offence to other governments,
appears now to be taking second place to a more assertive, even aggressive
approach to foreign relations.
The island is fighting to emerge from the shadow of diplomatic isolation
cast over it since 1971, when the United Nations switched recognition from
Taipei to Beijing.
President Lee Teng-hui in 1993 announced a seemingly quixotic bid to return
to the UN with the words 'Hope is more important than reality, for without
hope, how can one expect to achieve reality?'
China vehemently opposes Taiwanese membership, and as a permanent member of
the UN's security council was able to block efforts last month and in the
autumn of 1993 by Taiwan's friends to have the matter brought before the UN
general assembly.
China regards Taiwan as a renegade province, and forces governments to
choose between Taipei and Beijing for their diplomatic relations.
Just 29 countries now recognise Taiwan, and it is debatable how long the
biggest of those, South Africa, will hold out against Beijing's advances now
that it is no longer the pariah state it was under apartheid.
Governments that do not have formal ties with Taiwan are attempting to gauge
what sort of entity Taiwan will be a few years hence and how their policies
should reflect expected changes.
The new (unstated) policy first materialised in May, when the US government,
under pressure from China, refused to allow Taiwan's president, Lee
Teng-hui, stay overnight in Hawaii en route to central America. Taiwan
gained a lot of sympathy and publicity in the US as it sought to portray
Washington as Beijing's lapdog.
Then Taiwan used a dispute with Beijing over whether a Taiwanese official
should be allowed to attend the Asian Games to stir debate in Japan.
The incident worked to great effect as China co-operatively kicked up a fuss
at every opportunity, real or imagined. Especially galling to Beijing was
when Taiwan's deputy premier, Mr Hsu Li-teh, exchanged name-cards with
Japan's education minister.
Then there was that ovation at the opening ceremony.
On Monday Taiwan plans to wave its red national flag in front of the Chinese
bull with a gala Taiwanese national day celebration in Hong Kong's cultural
centre.
Observers are wondering what sort of international spectacle may emerge at
the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum to be held in Jakarta in
November.
'This is part of Taiwan's two-pronged strategy,' said a Taipei-based western
observer. 'First, the government is trying to stir up public sympathy in
countries with strong legislative support for Taiwan. Second, they've
discovered that it is quite easy to provoke outrage from Beijing, and the
more Beijing bullies Taiwan, the stupider the Chinese look.' Taiwan comes
off looking reasonable, even gracious, in contrast.
Perhaps policy-makers decided that the old diplomatic methods were not
achieving the desired result, so there was nothing to be lost by trying a
new approach.
The new confrontational Taiwan has foreign governments bemused, but on
guard, fearing they may be targetted next.
But hardliners in Taiwan warn that openly provoking Beijing could lead to a
military attack. China has not ruled out using force to stop Taiwan from
declaring independence.
Supporters of independence dismiss such warnings as scaremongering. They
believe that China would not dare attack Taiwan, and if it did, the US would
rush to Taiwan's defence despite the absence of such a treaty.
While it is evident that no government will risk forfeiting access to
China's vast potential market to further Taiwan's diplomatic ambitions, it
is equally evident that Taiwan's current status is not tenable indefinitely.
Sympathy for Taiwan is growing in the US Congress, the Japanese Diet
(parliament) and in the legislatures of other western countries. Already
lawmakers are pressing their governments to grant Taiwan better treatment.
