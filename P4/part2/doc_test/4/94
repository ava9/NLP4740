TAIWAN: ZAU-NAN CHEN'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS SAY HE IS INNOCENT, NOT AN ADVOCATE 
OF VIOLENCE AND SEDITION.

When Taiwanese officials finally gave Zau-Nan Chen a visa to return to his 
homeland last spring, the Westminster businessman took it as a sign that 
Taiwan's new government was serious about democratic reform. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the video store owner and democracy activist was arrested before he 
got off the plane at the Taipei airport. 
</P>
<P>
Though Chen is an Austrian citizen who has lived in the United States for a 
decade, Taiwanese officials jailed him and charged him with sedition. On Sept. 
22, he was convicted and sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Taiwan government in Los Angeles said Chen had advocated 
the violent overthrow of the island's government. But Chen's wife and friends 
insist that he is a political prisoner who was targeted because of his 
association with Taiwan's most famous dissident, Hsu Hsin-liang. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1980 and 1984, Chen was general manager of the Formosa Weekly, a 
now-defunct newspaper published by Hsu in Los Angeles, associates said. The 
newspaper criticized martial law in Taiwan and was a rallying point for the 
political opposition in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Among the evidence against Chen was a 1984 series of articles published by the 
newspaper about urban guerrilla warfare. The government alleges that the 
articles were aimed at "inciting people to start guerrilla warfare to overthrow 
the government on Taiwan," said Carol Cho, spokeswoman for the Coordination 
Council for North American Affairs, Taiwan's quasi-official diplomatic mission 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"They tried to paint Mr. Chen as a violent (person). He is not," said Chen's 
longtime friend Ching J. Shieh, a Fountain Valley aerospace engineer who 
attended part of Chen's trial in Taipei. "We maintain that we promote the 
Taiwanese democratic process through peaceful means." 
</P>
<P>
Chen's conviction has left his wife, an ailing piano teacher, struggling to 
manage three children and three businesses alone. Fung In Chen, 43, was 
hospitalized briefly last week with a bleeding ulcer, a condition she says has 
been worsened by the stress of her husband's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"I support my husband's ideals, that he cares about his motherland so much," 
she said through an interpreter during an interview Thursday. "He's the kind of 
a man that I respect very much. But being his wife and the mother of three, I 
also worry that it will end up like a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
"Our three children, they've been very understanding . . .," she said. Mrs. 
Chen bowed her head low and covered her hands with her eyes, but tears dropped 
onto the table in front of her. "Of course, they worry about their father very 
much." 
</P>
<P>
Chen's arrest has also left Taiwanese-Americans like Shieh wondering why 
Taiwan's officials gave Chen a visa if they intended to arrest him, whether 
other U.S. citizens risk retaliation for political activities in this country, 
and whether the Taipei government is sincere about ending four decades of 
one-party rule. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big case here," said Vincent Diau, a Los Angeles reporter for the 
Chinese Daily News, the leading Chinese-language newspaper in Southern 
California. "In this case Mr. Chen is arrested, but who is next nobody knows. . 
. . The situation right now is very unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
Chen's backers say the businessman has been made a scapegoat since many far 
more prominent dissidents, including Chen's mentor, Hsu, have been pardoned. 
</P>
<P>
Hsu spent nearly a decade in exile in Los Angeles and was repeatedly refused 
permission to return to Taiwan. Last year, he was arrested when he tried to 
slip back into Taiwan on a fishing boat and was convicted of sedition. In May, 
Hsu and nine others were freed by Taiwan's new President Lee Teng-hui. 
</P>
<P>
"The president gave everyone the impression that this is the time for the 
wounds to heal, and everyone who has previously opposed the government should 
come back and talk," said Daniel Sheh, who owned a business next door to 
Chen's. "So he went back and he was arrested." 
</P>
<P>
Chen was arrested on June 24 and released six days later. On July 4, the 
government and opposition agreed on democratic reforms, including a popular 
vote for president, a decision that one opposition leader called "a peaceful 
revolution." In light of that, Chen's wife said she expected the charges to be 
dropped, but his trial began in August. 
</P>
<P>
The Austrian consul general in Los Angeles, Franz Cede, said he was 
"flabbergasted" to learn Thursday from a reporter of Chen's conviction, since 
the last report from the embassy was that Chen had been freed. Cede said he 
intended to inform Vienna of the case but was not optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely it will not be easy for the Austrian authorities to help him in 
Taiwan as we do not have diplomatic representation there," Cede said. 
</P>
<P>
Chen's troubles began when he boarded a plane on June 22 to return home for the 
first time in 20 years. He and his wife had left Taiwan in 1969 to study music 
in Austria, Mrs. Chen said. There, they renounced their Taiwanese citizenship 
and became Austrian citizens. Chen became involved in Taiwanese exile politics. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the couple moved to Southern California to help Hsu launch his 
newspaper. Though Chen occasionally wrote editorials, he was mainly involved in 
fund raising and managing the business side of the newspaper, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Chen left the newspaper to start his own business. His Taiwanese 
Cultural Center, which rents Chinese-language videotapes and sells books and 
magazines, now has branches in Westminster, Irvine and Huntington Beach. Though 
Mrs. Chen became a U.S. citizen, Chen retained Austrian citizenship so he could 
look after business interests there, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Chen joined the newly formed Taiwan Revolutionary Party, of which Hsu 
was also a member. Spokeswoman Cho said the party advocated overthrowing the 
government by force; Chen's associates say the party explicitly rejected 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
Chen had been refused a visa to return to Taiwan since his days in Austria, but 
he continued to apply each year, his wife said. His mother had surgery this 
spring, and he was desperate to go back. When his visa came through on June 12, 
he was ecstatic, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
"For over 20 years he has been refused to go back," said Leonard Hsu, a 
Monterey Park businessman and secretary general of the Taiwan Democratic 
Movement Overseas. "For somebody like him, he was so happy when he got a visa 
from the government, so it was really like falling into a trap by the (ruling) 
government." 
</P>
<P>
According to Cho, Chen was well aware that a warrant had been issued for his 
arrest in 1985 because property he owned in Taipei had been seized by the 
government. Regaining that property was the real motive for Chen's trip, 
Taiwanese officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"When he applied (for) the visa, my colleague in the visa section advised him 
that he would be arrested because he is on the wanted list," Cho said. 
Moreover, she said, Chen signed a statement saying that he would accept legal 
responsibility for his words and deeds during his years abroad, "even if this 
means putting myself in prison." 
</P>
<P>
Chen's friends, however, insist that if such a warrant did exist, it was never 
made public. 
</P>
<P>
"The warrant was never published until he was arrested, and then the government 
claimed the warrant was issued in 1988," Shieh said. He said Chen was warned he 
might be questioned upon arrival in Taipei but was never told of the warrant. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Sheh, who owns an insurance business next to Chen, said he isn't 
involved in exile politics but believes that the Taiwan government has no right 
to try a foreign national for treason. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an American citizen and I was born and raised in Taiwan," Sheh said. "I 
thought that I am protected by the First Amendment. . . . But then this 
constitutional right has been challenged by foreign authorities. This is the 
real issue here."
