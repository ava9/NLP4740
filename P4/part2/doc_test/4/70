<F P=106> [Article by Li Jiaquan (2621 1367 3123): "Where Are His </F>
Emotions as a Chinese? -- Commenting on Li Teng-hui's 
Conversation With Ryotaro Shiba"] 
  [Text] Mr. Li Teng-hui said after taking charge of the 
government in Taiwan: "I am a Taiwanese as well as a Chinese." 
Li traces his ancestral home to Fujian Province's Yongding 
County, and he was born and brought up in Taiwan. Indeed, like 
he says himself, he is a Taiwanese as well as a Chinese, a 
Chinese who lives in Taiwan. Precisely because he has this kind 
of status and does not have the burdens known to Chiang Kai-shek 
and his son, people expect him to play a special and 
irreplaceable role across the strait, dissolve the "complex" 
left behind by history, and enable cross- strait relations or 
the Taiwan question to have a solution which is more reasonable 
and acceptable to various sides, thus, accomplishing a historic 
project which is even greater than the recovery of Taiwan and 
the "democratization of Taiwan." However, at this moment, 
people are indeed somewhat disappointed. 
<H5>  Great Revelation of the Secrets in His Heart </H5>
  Mr. Li Teng-hui's conversation with Ryotaro Shiba is a 
"great 
revelation" of the secrets in his heart. It seems that we do 
not see any feelings of him being a Chinese. In his 
conversation, he could not help revealing a certain kind of 
feeling that he missed being "Japanese," an identity which 
ceased when he was 22 years old. Regarding Ryotaro Shiba's words 
beautifying the aggressive behavior committed by the Japanese 
colonialists and imperialists in the past, and words which were 
hostile and encouraged the dismemberment of China, he listened 
comfortably and even went along with him and chimed in with him. 
On the other hand, he talked glibly about the so-called "sorrow 
of the Taiwan people," and traced the root of this sorrow to the 
Chinese mainland. He said the Kuomintang was a "regime coming 
from the outside," and he had doubts about the concept of 
"China." He even said explicitly that Beijing's idea of the 
reunification of the two sides of the strait was a "weird 
dream." In the beginning and at the end of the conversation, he 
compared himself with Moses, who, according to "Exodus" in the 
"Old Testament," led the Jews across the Red Sea to their native 
place to rebuild their houses and farms. His intention is very 
clear. No wonder many Chinese people on both sides of the 
strait, as well as overseas Chinese, are "shocked." 
<H5>  What Are the Emotions of a Chinese? </H5>
  As a Taiwan Chinese, one should understand the sentiments of 
the people there, and this is beyond reproach. Whether Li 
Teng-hui has really been able to do this is another matter. But 
I think that as a Taiwan Chinese, Mr. Li Teng-hui must not only 
understand the sentiments of the people there, but must also 
understand the sentiments of all Chinese people, and these two 
are in fact inseparable. The history of modern China is a 
history of China being invaded, exploited, and humiliated, and 
almost all the imperialist countries in the world have committed 
aggression against China. Situated on China's frontier, Taiwan 
suffered the most. The people on the mainland felt as if they 
themselves had suffered. In modern history, the rulers of China 
were weak and incompetent when dealing with foreign countries, 
but practiced sanguinary rule at home, and people on both sides 
of the strait suffered together. Speaking from this sense, the 
Taiwan people's sorrow is also the mainland people's sorrow, and 
is the common sorrow of the people on the two sides of the 
strait. The hearts of the people on the two sides of the strait 
are completely linked. It is neither adequate nor complete to 
see only the Taiwan people's sorrow. 
  The entire modern history of China is, first, a history of 
conflict between the people and imperialist aggressors, and 
second, a history of conflict between the people and reactionary 
rulers. The ceding of Taiwan to Japan by the Qing court after it 
lost the 1894 Sino-Japanese War, and the "28 February" incident 
which took place in Taiwan after its recovery and came under 
Kuomintang rule, are embodiments of these two major conflicts. 
Regarding this history, Taiwan's Chinese people should also 
have a clear understanding; they should not distort the nature 
and orientation of the conflicts or blame mainland people for 
the "Taiwan people's sorrow," or attribute that sorrow to a 
"regime coming from outside" the mainland, or even use it as an 
excuse to "fight communism and resist peace" and oppose the 
reunification of the two sides of the strait. 
  The emotions of the Chinese people on the two sides of the 
strait are inseparable. In history, the Chinese people on the 
two sides of the strait, in order to resist foreign aggression, 
oppose reactionary rule at home, fight for the independence of 
the Chinese nation, and safeguard the country's sovereignty and 
territorial integrity, have struggled hand in hand, shed blood 
and sacrificed, and stepped into the breach as others fell. 
Bravely and indomitably, they have together written down 
numerous moving and glorious chapters. This kind of historical 
and national sentiment, which was crystallized in blood and tear 
can never be distorted and dispersed by the agitated and 
emotional words of a few people. 
  The mainland people are very happy to see the economic 
achievements made by the Taiwan people in the last several 
decades. What is strange is that, while Chinese people 
throughout the whole world are jubilant at the economic 
achievements made by the mainland over the past several years, 
some in Taiwan do not feel very comfortable; first, in the 
economic arena, they have adopted various measures to try to 
cool down the "mainland craze"; then, in the political arena, 
they made a fuss over the Qiandao Lake incident," trying hard to 
distort the feelings of Taiwan compatriots toward the mainland. 
What is their intention? 
<H5>  Must Not Mislead People's Emotions </H5>
  Regarding the emotions of the Chinese who are in Taiwan, 
there is the question of "understanding," as well as a question 
of "guidance." Whether these emotions can be properly 
understood and guided is to a great extent determined by whether 
those in power can properly perceive themselves and history. We 
have noticed that Mr Li Teng-hui, as a scholar, is quite capable 
of considering "how to exercise self-restraint," just as he 
himself said during the conversation, and that he is quite 
humble and objective when handling matters; in short, he has 
scientific attitude, and this is precisely one of the important 
reasons why he has earned "trust" and "respect" from various 
quarters in Taiwan. However, now, along with the changes in his 
power and status, just like someone has said, he has become 
"complacent." This time, when Ryotaro Shiba flattered him by 
boasting about his "key to grasping politics" and said that he 
was quite "at home using political strategy," Li immediately 
told him: "I have been very keen since I was a child," and 
people even "alleged that I am a military genius!" Perhaps that 
is a fact. But judged from history, when a person, especially a 
political figure, sees only his own role or overestimates his 
own role, then he begins to make mistakes, as if the world is 
his and nothing is impossible. He sees himself as a "savior," as 
if what he "thinks" is what the people "want." The result is 
divergence from the people, divergence from reality, and 
breaking his head to the extent of bleeding. 
  Judged from Taiwan's actual conditions, people are not free 
from this kind of worry. Since Li Teng-hui took charge of the 
government in Taiwan, he has indeed done some good things for 
the Taiwan people, and has made his own contribution to the 
improvement of cross-strait relations. However, after 
accomplishing "constitutional reform" with "high proficiency," 
some unrealistic ideas of his have emerged. Taiwan is an 
inseparable part of China, and Taiwan people are Chinese people. 
But recently, a sense of separation with Taiwan as the mainstay 
has grown infinitely. The so-called "independent sovereignty" 
theory, "the country of Taiwan" theory, "the nation of Taiwan" 
theory, the theory of "giving priority to the interests of 
Taiwan," the theory of the "life commonwealth of Taiwan," the 
theory of "reinterpretation of sovereignty," the "Republic of 
China in Taiwan," and the "expedient measure of two China's" 
have all emerged. During this conversation, Mr. Li Teng-hui 
explicitly proposed the building of "a Taiwan people's country." 
Is this a deliberate attempt to "mislead" the people? When one 
considers that some people on the island worship Li Teng-hui as 
"Emperor Li," and express Li Teng-hui's "ideas and achievements" 
as "Li Teng-hui-ism," there is cause for worry. 
  It is understandable that as Chinese people living in 
Taiwan, 
they advocate love for Taiwan, "lifting heads," and "being the 
master." However, if certain people who have other intentions 
set love for Taiwan against love for the motherland; set 
"lifting heads" and "being the master" against the great 
undertaking of the reunification of the motherland; set the 
well-being of 21 million people against the long-term and basic 
interests of 1.2 billion people, that is, the whole nation; 
separate Taiwan people from Chinese people; and engage in the 
so-called "Taiwan people's country," then they will jeopardize 
the basic interests of the entire Chinese people, including 
those in Taiwan. Furthermore, it is very dangerous to do this 
as this would bring disastrous results to the 21 million Taiwan 
people, and the 1.2 billion Chinese people will never allow them 
to do this. 
<H5>  Chinese People's Affairs Should Be Handled By Chinese People </H5>
  A Chinese proverb goes: "A fly does not sting an egg which 
has no crack." Some unresolved "complexes" between the two 
sides of the strait and some people's speeches which advocate 
separation or have a separatist tendency, have already give 
opportunities to certain foreign forces. They fear China's 
reunification, unity, and prosperity, so they try hard to sow 
discord between the Chinese people on the two sides of the 
strait. The common trick they use is to "restrict Chinese with 
Chinese" and "separate them to control them." Is it not true 
that the so-called "restricting the Kuomintang with the 
Democratic Progressive Party," "restricting the CPC with the 
Kuomintang," and "restricting reunification with 'Taiwan 
independence'" are new tricks employed by certain aggressive 
foreign forces under the new historical conditions? History is 
a mirror, and individual and political parties alike must guard 
against being used as a tool by aggressive foreign forces to 
deal with his own motherland and compatriots. 
  The affairs of the Chinese people should be settled by the 
Chinese people themselves. Perhaps, due to personal experience, 
although Mr. Li Teng-hui admits being a Chinese, he lacks a real 
and thorough understanding of the Chinese people in Taiwan, and 
he has even less understanding of the Chinese people on the 
mainland, nor does he understand the thinkings and emotions of 
the entire Chinese people. Otherwise, it would be difficult to 
answer the following questions: The people on the two sides of 
the strait are Chinese people, but are unable to sit down 
together to discuss their home affairs, while every effort is 
made to have foreigners "weigh down" the Chinese. Is this not 
just the opposite to what people wish? Why cannot the leaders of 
the political parties or those in power on the two sides of the 
strait "talk face to face," while with this Japanese, who still 
harbors a great deal of hostility toward China and cherishes the 
Japanese occupation of Taiwan, he could sit side by side and 
talk intimately, sticking to each other like glue? 
  Why, in front of foreign leaders, can he "lower his body," 
"speak softly," and even "act humbly" to seek dialogue and 
communication, but mention "status," cite "price," pursue 
"equality," and in fact refuse others completely when hearing 
repeated calls from mainland leaders for dialogue and 
communication between the leaders of the two sides of the 
strait? There can only be one answer, that is, "using the 
external to restrict the internal"; as a result, foreigners reap 
the benefits. 
<H5>  True Meaning of So-Called "Sovereignty Rests With the </H5>
People" 
  Mr. Li Teng-hui has another theory, that is, "sovereignty 
rests with the people." The intention of preaching "sovereignty 
rests with the people" is to deal with the CPC's one country, 
two systems, to negate China's sovereignty over Taiwan, to use 
it as a banner in an attempt to enter the United Nations, and to 
create a "Taiwan people's country" which is separate from the 
mainland. In fact, this is precisely what certain foreign 
forces want. However, this can never be a way out. 
  What kind of "people" is the "people" in "sovereignty rests 
with the people?" Is it a people controlled and misled or a 
"people" completely free of control and who really understand 
the actual situation? Is it a portion or a minority of "people" 
or is it the entire and majority of "people?" These are great 
topics to be discussed. In history, we see various incidents in 
which the will of the "people" has been stolen to serve some 
people's political ambitions, but, eventually, even though they 
might have succeeded for a while, they could not escape the 
punishment of history. What is particularly worth mentioning is 
that, concerning the big matter of a country's sovereignty, it 
is never changed by a small number of conspirators who plot the 
"will of people." 
  The government and people on the mainland have exercised 
great restraint toward recent outrageous speeches made by some 
persons in the Taiwan authorities. Perhaps, because some of 
them are Taiwan-born people, the mainland has more or less "held 
back from doing anything against them for fear of involving good 
people," and this is also not to give foreigners loopholes to 
infiltrate. I hope they will not go too far down the road and 
will not see restraint as weakness with which they can take 
liberties, as they would be completely wrong. 
  Finally, I suggest that Mr. Li Teng-hui comes to the 
mainland 
to carry out research and inspection in the capacity of an 
individual. Since he says he can visit various countries in the 
name of "Dr. Li" or as an "agricultural expert," then why can he 
not come to the mainland with such a status? Please be aware 
that it is not feasible to formulate a mainland policy based on 
"assumptions" and the "emotional" thoughts of a small number of 
people without understanding the mainland and without 
understanding the real thoughts and emotions of 1.2 billion 
Chinese people.
