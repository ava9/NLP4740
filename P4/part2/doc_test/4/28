  [Excerpts] The Chinese Embassy in Bangkok yesterday 
continued to show Peking's "concern" about the private visit to 
Thailand of Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui next week. 
  National Security Council [NSC] Secretary General Charan 
Kunlawanit said the Chinese Embassy counsellor called on him at 
Government House yesterday to express his government's "concern" 
about Mr. Li's visit which will begin on Monday. 
  He said he told the Chinese envoy that the visit was private 
and had nothing to do with any state agencies, including the 
NSC. The invitation was extended to the Taiwanese president by 
the Thai private sector, and the visit was, therefore, not 
recognized by the government. 
  Gen. Charan said the Chinese envoy was concerned that the 
visit, although private, might affect good relations between 
Thailand and China. He said he assured the envoy of Thailand's 
strict adherence to the one-China policy and asked him not to 
worry too much. He said he was not aware of the full details of 
Mr. Li's itinerary except for a vacation in Phuket. [passage 
omitted] 
  Gen. Charan said he exchanged views with the embassy 
counsellor about regional cooperation on narcotics suppression. 
  Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri said that 
no 
Thai cabinet ministers would meet the Taiwanese president either 
in their official or private capacities. He said he had no plan 
to meet Mr. Li, and would turn down such a request if one was 
put to him. [passage omitted] 
  Asked if there was any possibility of the Taiwanese 
president 
discussing economic issues with economic ministers, Sqn. Ldr. 
Prasong said "no." 
  The minister said he did not pay attention to details of the 
visit when asked if he knew how many days Mr. Li would stay in 
Thailand. 
  Government Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa stressed the 
private 
nature of President Li's trip, and said Thailand was a free 
country open to visitors. The spokesman said there was 
substantial business activity between Thais and Taiwanese, and 
that a large number of Thais were working in Taiwan.
