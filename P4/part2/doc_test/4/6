over whether Taiwan will seek to be a Chinese province or a sovereign state

Taiwanese voters will cast a ballot for the island's identity as much as for
cleaner streets in local elections early next month.
The long-ruling Nationalist party, or Kuomintang (KMT), is marshalling all
the considerable forces at its disposal to maintain control of the two
biggest cities and a governorship on the island it officially calls a
province of China - the Republic of China, that is, not the People's
Republic of China.
The KMT, which retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after defeat at the hands of Mao
Zedong's communist armies, now faces a formidable challenge to its political
survival in the shape of the Democratic Progressive party, which advocates
an independent Taiwan. It also suffered from attrition when disaffected
conservative KMT members broke away to form the New Party last year.
Ironically, old foes have become allies as the Nationalists have been aided
in their electoral campaign by Chinese officials, who have in recent days
reiterated Beijing's longstanding threat to use force against Taiwan should
circumstances warrant. President Jiang Zemin yesterday reportedly told US
President Bill Clinton at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum in
Jakarta that if Taiwanese authorities declare independence, China would
certainly not stand by and do nothing.
Next month's polls represent the penultimate stage in a process of
democratisation which began in the mid-1980s, marked by successive elections
starting from the lowest levels of government and culminating in direct
presidential elections in early 1996.
In the December 3 elections, voters will for the first time choose mayors
for the cities of Taipei and Kaohsiung, where about a quarter of Taiwan's
21m residents live, and a governor for Taiwan province, comprised of
territory other than the two cities and a few outlying islands. The posts
were previously appointed.
Should a DPP candidate win, it would be the first time the leading
opposition party would have captured a significant administrative post. The
KMT accuses the DPP of being irresponsible and incapable of governing, while
the DPP says the ruling party is irredeemably corrupt and inefficient.
The Taipei mayoral seat is widely expected to go to Mr Chen Shui-bian, a
popular DPP lawmaker in Taiwan's Legislative Yuan, or parliament. Mr Wu
Dun-yih, the KMT incumbent, is seen likely to retain the mayorship of
Kaohsiung.
But it is the symbolically significant post of provincial governor which is
especially critical to the KMT, and it has spared no expense in drawing on
its vast financial resources to ensure victory for the incumbent candidate,
Mr James Soong. Mr Soong is one of the few remaining top Taiwanese
politicians to have been born in mainland China, the others having been
shunted out of the KMT's mainstream faction in recent years.
The KMT cannot afford to lose the provincial governorship poll because it is
seen as a referendum on the identity of Taiwan and future relations with
China. The KMT says Taiwan is a province of China and supports eventual
reunification with China under condition of peace and democracy on both
sides of Taiwan Strait. The DPP says Taiwan is not a Chinese province but an
independent nation and thus the entire provincial government structure is
redundant and should be abolished.
The KMT also fears that if the DPP wins control of the provincial
government, which administers three-quarters of the island's territory and
population, something analogous to the 'Yeltsin effect' could materialise,
at least in theory - a reference to how the power of the head of the Russian
republic eclipsed that of the leader of the former Soviet Union.
Political analysts say that a win by the DPP's candidate, Mr Chen Ting-nan,
would pose an indirect threat to the legitimacy of the president himself, as
he was in effect installed by a rubber-stamp parliament rather than popular
mandate.
In practice, President Lee Teng-hui enjoys enormous popular support, even
among many DPP members, because he is a native Taiwanese and it is widely
believed that he secretly favours the island's independence. As the polling
day draws nearer, the KMT will likely play the 'president card', in the
parlance of the local media, and bring Mr Lee on an extensive tour of the
island to win votes. The same strategy helped carry the KMT to victory in
islandwide polls a year ago which the DPP was predicted to win.
