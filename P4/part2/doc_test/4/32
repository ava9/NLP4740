Last Sunday's agreement between China and Taiwan was in itself a limited
affair, confined to mundane issues on which the two governments have an
obvious common interest. Yet one of those issues - the repatriation of
airline hijackers and illegal immigrants - is of considerable emotional and
ideological significance. Not so long ago any migrant who reached Taiwan
from mainland China, by whatever method, would have been welcomed as a
refugee from communism, following in the footsteps of the Chinese
nationalist government which fled to Taiwan in 1949.
That the two governments are now able to agree on such an issue, or indeed
on any substantive political issue, marks an important change - as does the
fact that the agreement was negotiated in Taiwan by a senior Chinese
official, Tang Shubei. Inevitably, the breakthrough has fuelled speculation
that the two sides might be moving towards reunification, which both still
claim as their ultimate goal. The difference between them is ideological
rather than ethnic or national, so if ideological differences can be
overcome reunification seems a logical end result. The example of Germany,
where reunification came about through the fall of communism and the triumph
of democracy, should be encouraging from Taiwan's point of view.
Taiwanese wary
Yes, but the example of Vietnam, where reunification came through the
triumph of communism, is closer in space if further off in time; and in
China's case the disparity in size is so much in the mainland's favour that
Taiwanese are understandably wary. A vocal minority of them, represented by
the Democratic Progressive Party, favours independence for the island.
President Lee Teng-hui, himself born in Taiwan, is believed privately to
share their views.
Certainly that seems the only logical interpretation of his vigorous
campaign for UN membership. The UN is an organisation of sovereign states,
in which China's seat has been occupied by the Beijing regime since 1972. Mr
Lee is not seeking to reclaim that seat but to win separate membership for
his own state, which amounts to a claim of separate sovereignty.
His campaign has no chance of success so long as Beijing opposes it. The
majority of UN members, including the other four permanent members of the
Security Council, decided long ago that mainland China is too important -
geopolitically and now economically as well - for its government's wishes on
such a sensitive point to be ignored. But that has not stopped Taiwan, as an
emerging economic power, from playing a major role in the regional and
global economy. It is a founder member of the Asian Development Bank, and is
now negotiating to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It would
be good if a way could be found for it to participate, with or without full
membership, in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund as well.
Options open
While the Taiwan business community is increasingly keen on closer ties with
the mainland (having already invested there on a grand scale), more than 40
per cent of the population favours neither reunification nor independence.
Indeed, it makes good sense for Taiwan to keep its options open as far as
possible, while observing how China develops. In responding to any pressure
for reunification from the Chinese side, Taiwan is entitled to expect
international support in insisting that this can happen only if and when its
people so decide. As a first step, China should unequivocally eliminate any
threat to seek unity by force.
In making their judgment, the Taiwanese will rightly reject any suggestion
that they should adapt to communism, and will look instead for evidence that
China is adapting to the system which has made Taiwan such an outstanding
success. On the economic side the signs are encouraging; but in terms of
political democracy the mainland has not yet begun to follow the path boldly
charted by Mr Lee since he came to power in 1988. Taiwan will watch with
particular interest to see how Hong Kong fares when sovereignty there
reverts to China, under the principle of 'one country, two systems', in
1997.
