THREE COLOURS RED (15) Krzysztof Kieslowski
DREAM LOVER (18)Nicholas Kazan
SLEEP WITH ME (18) Rory Kelly
FLESH AND BONE (15) Steve Kloves
IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU (PG) Andrew Bergman
Is the crusty retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant) at the centre of
Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours Red really a portrait of the director?
Kieslowski is now a crusty retired film-maker. Before unwrapping this
farewell movie at Cannes last May, he announced that he was going into a
life of chain-smoking leisure and contemplation. Like Judge Trintignant, he
realises that truth is a desperate thing to keep chasing; and that curiosity
about human beings is not necessarily an honest virtue, just as often it may
be, or may become, a sleazy addiction.
Trintignant, deep in the book-lined villa where the film's
student/fashion-model heroine (Irene Jacob) first finds him, after she has
injured his Alsatian dog in a car collision, spends his days tapping into
neighbours' phone calls. Like a movie-maker he flirts with omniscience. He
knows of the next-door husband's guilt: 'Sooner or later he'll jump out of a
window and his wife will know everything.' He knows too about the blonde
girl who is two-timing her young lawyer boyfriend, who happens to live near
Jacob herself.
A few scenes later, prompted by our heroine's virtuous indignation, Judge
Trintignant reveals his crimes to the cops and the newspapers. Enough with
the hi-tech voyeurism, he seems to say. And is Kieslowski saying the same?
Three Colours Red rounds off the Polish film-maker's tricouleur trilogy with
this essay on fraternity. The movie, like the Judge, often seems tired. Many
of the metaphysical Kieslowski twitchings were displayed to better effect in
Blue.
This goes for the obsession with parallel lives. Is Mlle Jacob's young
lawyer neighbour mystically re-living Trintignant's life, right down to
exact, reverberant incidents like the dropping of a pile of exam books in
the street? It also goes for the director's fondness for deus ex machina
wrap-ups. In Red we have a hideously glib ending in which a cross-channel
ferry is sacrificed to bad weather so that six people can survive to reveal
themselves as - yes] - the key young characters from all three trilogy
movies. This includes the young lawyer, at last hurled by Fate into Jacob's
arms.
Red begins as a movie about communication between people and generations.
The opening sequence is a dazzler: camera snaking at high speed along phone
cables as they plunge through earth and then under the sea. And thereafter
the film's title colour is picked out in each scene, warmly, brilliantly,
like a electronic beacon between strangers and ages.
But midway through the film we start to get an empty, hungry feeling. Surely
Kieslowski and regular co-writer Krzysztof Piesiewicz have forgotten
something vital: to put real people into this story. Where past heroines -
Juliette Binoche in Blue, Irene Jacob in The Double Life Of Veronique - were
tortured, touching souls grappling with the tragicomedy of everyday life, no
one in Red lives and breathes except as illustrations to a thesis. That
thesis is: Everything, for good and ill, connects.
Trintignant's Judge is the sacred and profane side of our Neighbourhood
Watch epoch: satanic, he snoops; God-like, he can confer happy endings.
Jacob's leggy, open-hearted model is a sort of Miss Perfect Human Communion
1994. And the setting is Geneva, world capital of brokered harmony. In the
Kieslowski cannon the jagged realities and loose nerve-ends of Blue, and the
song-without-end mysticism of Veronique, have been put away for this too,
too neat last testament. Red shows that even lives that do not naturally
connect can be forced into harmony by a little hi-tech hot-wiring mixed with
supernatural benison.
But every film industry likes to compel human unions when it cannot
germinate them naturally. Each film this week is a variant on that oldest
coercive formula of all: Boy Meets Girl.
Nicholas Kazan's Dream Lover is a directing debut by the screenwriter of
Patty Hearst and Reversal Of Fortune. So we expect a few frissons amid the
amatory fol-de-rol. Boy (James Spader) meets girl (Madchen Amick); then boy
starts to wish he had not met girl when Amick shows signs of deceit,
infidelity and a hidden past. Boy ends up in a mental asylum hatching murder
plots.
While ambiguity thrives, the film has a wicked wit. Kazan lets Spader get
ever more lost amid the chic white spaces of his home and office - he is an
architect (but, ah irony, not of his own destiny) - while Amick's
dream-bride beauty becomes ever more sinisterly blanched and iconic. For 80
of its 103 minutes, we are guessing, fretting and chewing the nearest set of
fingernails. But the ending is a disaster: a surrender to thriller cliche
that should be stamped like a black spot on Kazan's directing CV, to warn
future employers.
In Rory Kelly's Sleep With Me, boy (Eric Stoltz) meets girl (Meg Tilly); boy
marries girl; boy then discovers that second boy (Craig Sheffer), his
longtime friend, has raging passion for girl. We move into a Jules and Jim
syndrome, California-style, in which kooky triangular fun alternates with
moments of semi-murderous intent.
Six scriptwriters, including Neal Jimenez (River's Edge) and Roger Heddon
(Bodies, Rest And Motion), each worked at different story sections: which
explains why the film feels like a game of consequences played out by the
students of a creative writing class. Some innocent-seeming scenes are sharp
as a paper's edge. Others, notably the rambling 'confessions' to video
camera during a long barbecue sequence, are as blunt as yesterday's writing
ideas that you balled up and threw into the WPB.
Do watch, though, for a funny cameo by Quentin Tarantino as a party guest
deconstructing Top Gun as a gay fable.
As for Flesh And Bone, what ever high-concept story conference produced
this? Boy (Dennis Quaid) meets girl (Meg Ryan). Boy, we learn, is the
grown-up ex-accomplice of a violent burglar father (James Caan) who shot to
death the girl's family when she was a baby. So the stage is set - or the
flat, moody, infinite Texas landscape - for a flat, moody, infinite film.
The slow incubation of revenge shares screen time with the grimly inert
'lerve' story at the centre.
It feels like a bad O'Neill play staged by a community theatre company: one
of those outdoor productions where the audience has to keep moving its
chairs around. Now we are watching everyday small-town life as it is clumped
through by Quaid, a man of few words and none of them interesting. Now we
are out in the cornfields with Ryan, wondering why the talented star of
Sleepless In Seattle took on this rewardless, one-note role. Ah, yes; of
course. She is married to Quaid.
Dynastic connections are important in Hollywood. It Could Happen To You is a
romantic comedy starring Nicolas Cage, nephew of Francis Coppola, and
Bridget Fonda, daughter of Peter, and directed by Andrew Bergman, son of
Ingmar: if only.
Ingmar should have taken over this film and given it teeth and mania. Boy
(policeman) meets girl (waitress). Boy, in lieu of tip, promises girl half
whatever he wins on a lottery ticket. Boy wins lottery. Boy wins girl. Boy's
wife (Rosie Perez) promptly goes berserk, which provides the only comedy in
a film so thick with anodyne, lolloping romance that by the end we are
crying out for one of those murders so generously on offer in the week's
other movies.
