MGM/UA PLANS MAJOR MARCH RELEASE OF DAVIS MOVIES 
</P>

Most of the best films of Bette Davis, who died last Friday, already are on 
home video, but there are still a few quality ones that haven't been released. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA, which has a large Davis library, had planned a major release for April, 
but now is moving the date up to March, according to programming director 
George Feltenstein. 
</P>
<P>
The titles, which will retail at $19.98, include "Dangerous" -- the 1935 drama 
featuring her Oscar-winning performance -- "The Man Who Came to Dinner' (1941), 
"The Great Lie" (1941), "In This Our Life" (1942), "A Stolen Life" (1946) and 
"Deception" (1946). 
</P>
<P>
Also part of that release will be two movies previously out on CBS-Fox -- "The 
Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex" (1939) and "The Petrified Forest" (1936). 
The rights to these movies have reverted to MGM/UA. Feltenstein said "Elizabeth 
and Essex" will be duplicated from an improved print. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, if you're looking to savor Davis' finest work now, focus on movies 
made between the mid-'30s and early '50s. By the late '50s, she was doing 
character roles. Only a handful of her films from then on are worth your time. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the most prominent Davis films that are available on home 
video -- all for $24.95 or less: 
</P>
<P>
"Of Human Bondage" (Congress, 1934). The tragic tale of a doctor's (Leslie 
Howard) obsession with a trashy waitress (Davis). Though impressive back then, 
her performance now seems like overacting. Still, it's the role that made her a 
star. 
</P>
<P>
"Jezebel" (MGM/UA, 1938). Davis won an Oscar for her role as a sassy, spiteful, 
Scarlett O'Hara-like character in this absorbing pre-Civil War drama. She's 
delightfully tempestuous until she turns noble at the end. Henry Fonda co-stars 
as her fiance. The Oscar notwithstanding, this is good but not great Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"Dark Victory" (MGM/UA, 1939). In possibly her most famous tear-jerker, Davis 
plays a selfish, carefree socialite who finds out she's dying of a brain tumor. 
While doing some re-evaluating, she's consoled by husband-surgeon (George 
Brent). Sure, it's excessively manipulative and riddled with cliches, but just 
try to sit through it with dry eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Little Foxes" (Nelson/Orion, 1941). To veteran Davis fans, her scheming, 
callous Regina -- one of the screen's great evil leading characters -- is 
Davis' crowning glory. Based on Lillian Hellman's play, this meaty melodrama 
chronicles how greed destroys a Southern family. For those unfamiliar with 
Davis in her prime, this is the movie to see. 
</P>
<P>
"The Letter" (MGM/UA, 1940). Set is Malaya, it features Davis in one of her 
finest villain roles, this time playing a murderer who's hiding behind a 
self-defense plea. Directed by William Wyler and co-starring Herbert Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
"Now Voyager" (MGM/UA, 1942). Davis's best soap opera, though not her best 
performance in a soap opera. She plays a sheltered spinster who flowers into a 
sophisticate under the guidance of a psychiatrist (Paul Henried). Henried's 
dual cigarette-lighting scene was long considered one of the screen's great 
romantic moments. But, in this anti-smoking era, it's just a curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Skeffington" (MGM/UA, 1944). Possibly Davis' most overlooked, underrated 
drama, this sprawling soap, covering several decades, is about a selfish woman 
(Davis) who marries a stockbroker (Claude Rains) out of greed. Later on, the 
relationship ripens into love. Davis' intense, all-out performance belongs in 
her Top Five. 
</P>
<P>
"All About Eve" (CBS-Fox, 1950). To many critics, this is Davis' best 
performance -- as tough, cynical Broadway actress Margo Channing, who's the 
target of the trickery of deceptive Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter). Possibly 
Davis' most famous movie, it's a good introduction to those who know little 
about her. 
</P>
<P>
"A Pocketful of Miracles" (1961, MGM/UA, $19.98). The best of Davis' old-lady 
character roles. In this adaptation of a Damon Runyon story, she plays Apple 
Annie, a derelict who, to cover up a well-meaning lie, has to be transformed 
into a society matron. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" (Warner, 1962). Fun, campy, horror tale, with 
Davis, as a sadistic ex-child star, grandly caricaturing some of her old roles. 
This one, co-starring Joan Crawford, resurrected Davis' career and earned her a 
best-actress nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"The Whales of August" (Nelson/Orion, 1987). Talky character study consisting 
of two elderly sisters fussing at each other in a Maine summer cottage. More of 
interest as a bit of film history, watching Davis work with another cinema 
grand dame, silent-star Lillian Gish. 
</P>
<P>
Few of Davis' movies from the early 1930s are available on home video, 
including her first, "Bad Sister," a bad 1930 film notable because it was one 
of Humphrey Bogart's earliest movies. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Davis films not yet on video, the ones to watch for are 'Kid Galahad" 
(1937), "Old Acquaintance" (1943), "The Star" (1952), "A Catered Affair" (1956) 
and "Storm Center" (1956). 
</P>
<P>
"Beyond the Forest," a 1949 murder mystery, isn't on home video either. 
Co-starring Joseph Cotten, the film isn't particularly suspenseful, but it's 
noteworthy because it features Davis delivering her signature line, "What a 
dump." 
</P>
<P>
Davis' last film, "The Wicked Stepmother" -- which received only limited 
theatrical release and was controversial because of the star's well-publicized 
battles with director Larry Cohen -- is due out on MGM/UA on Nov. 14 at $79.95.
