The Hollywood Foreign Press Assn., notes one television producer, was always 
considered five to 10 years behind the times. Note its selection of Pia Zadora 
as "new star of the year" in 1981. But, if Saturday evening's 47th annual 
Golden Globe Awards was any indication, the group has become almost cutting 
edge. Performances by Wayne Newton and Suzanne Somers notwithstanding, a tone 
of "relevance" and social activism dominated the night. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam was very much in the forefront. Oliver Stone's "Born on the Fourth of 
July" swept four of the five categories in which it was nominated including 
motion picture (drama), director, screenplay and actor (Tom Cruise) -- boding 
well for similar victories in March's Academy Awards ceremonies. (Eight of the 
last Golden Globe best picture winners have gone on to repeat during the 
Oscars.) Though its star Dana Delaney was edged out by Angela Lansbury 
("Murder, She Wrote") in the TV acting category, "China Beach" -- which focuses 
on the women in the Vietnamese conflict -- was named best dramatic TV series. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights was also in the spotlight. "Driving Miss Daisy," the story of an 
elderly Jewish woman and her black chauffeur, walked off with the best motion 
picture (musical or comedy) award and the film's co-stars, Jessica Tandy and 
Morgan Freeman, won the top honors in their respective categories. Denzel 
Washington, who played a member of the first black infantry regiment in the 
Civil War epic "Glory," was selected as the best supporting actor in a dramatic 
motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Danson, designated best actor in a TV series (musical or comedy) for his 
performance in "Cheers," called for people to get off their couches and "hit 
the streets . . . to get out there and do something," while perennial favorite 
Audrey Hepburn, recipient of the evening's Cecil B. DeMille Award and a UNICEF 
activist, hailed the media ("radio, newspapers, films, TV -- all of it") for 
helping to create a "global compassion which to so many has become the lifeline 
and, in fact, saved millions of lives." 
</P>
<P>
The evening, broadcast by the Turner Broadcasting System, was as presenter 
James Woods described it, one of those "nice, silly perks" of the business. A 
rare opportunity for TV and film folk to co-mingle at what felt more like a 
sprawling family cocktail party than a stiff, career-impacting awards ceremony. 
Celebrities ranging from Gregory Peck to Tom Selleck made appearances. The 
festivities were relaxed and upbeat. One of the evenings biggest laughs 
occurred when Diane English, producer of "Murphy Brown" -- winner of the award 
for best TV series (musical or comedy) -- dangled one of the dried-out squabs 
from the dinner salad and asked if anyone wanted hers. Another when Steve 
Martin and Billy Crystal -- losers to Morgan Freeman in the movie actor 
category -- startled hosts Sam Elliott and Cybill Shepard by running on stage 
demanding to know who came in second. 
</P>
<P>
Director Oliver Stone was asked backstage to compare this win with that of his 
first Vietnam film "Platoon." "Like getting a second daughter married off," he 
said with a weary smile. 
</P>
<P>
Cruise, noting that Ron Kovic, the disabled veteran on whom "Born" was based, 
had been wounded 22 years ago to the day, expressed hope that "after tonight 
Jan. 20 will carry with it a better memory" for him. 
</P>
<P>
Kovic sounded patently political with allusions to a "new America" and John F. 
Kennedy. He refused to confirm reports that he's running for Congress in Orange 
County but declared in the euphoria of the moment: "If I do decide to run, I 
will win." 
</P>
<P>
If outsiders were tempted to read into the fact that minority artists scored 
big, the actors themselves did not. Asked how she interpreted the fact that her 
co-star Freeman and Washington won major awards, Jessica Tandy said: "They're 
both damn good actors . . . that's all." Washington, too, cautioned against 
excessive optimism. "I never regard anything as monumental," he said. "It's all 
evolution. This business is predicated on fear and spending someone's money. 
You ask them to give you $20 million in the hope you can bring them back $60 
million. We're moving in the right direction, but it's still very tough."
