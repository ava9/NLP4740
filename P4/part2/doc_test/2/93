The glorious galas: The Philharmonic Ball; Vista Del Mar Associates' theater 
gala surrounding "Jerome Robbins' Broadway"; the Jewel Gala for the USC School 
of Fine Arts; the Westside Guild of Childrens Hospital's Deck the Halls dinner 
and dance; the Hollywood Salute to Dennis Weaver. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, 550 of the city's elite dined and danced on stage at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion. White chrysanthemums rose from silver Champagne buckets on 
silver stilts. Vodka accompanied the cold caviar soup. Dessert came as white 
chocolate grand pianos filled with berries. John Williams conducted the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic in music ranging from waltzes to Glenn Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone loved it, giving president Liz Sobelle and co-chairs Joan MacLaughlin 
and Susan Rhoades high marks. The night was a special tribute to Philharmonic 
Executive Vice President and Managing Director Ernest Fleischmann. Kudos were 
heady -- from Stanley Beyer, Michael Connell, Fred Nicholas, Esther Wachtell 
and Gordon Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
The locally and internationally prominent were there: Priscilla and Curt 
Tamkin, Rocco (Eisenhower's personnel adviser) and Marion Siciliano (her art 
tribute was titled "Music in Ernest"), Donn and Peggy Miller, Francine Bardo, 
Glenn and Martha Mitchell, Dorie and Joe Pinola (off to the Taj Mahal), Keith 
and Bill Kieschnick (down from Napa), Count and Countess Frederic Chandon (who 
supplied the Moet &amp; Chandon Champagne), Budd Calisch, Ferrucio and Massimo 
Ferragamo (opening the new Ferragamo shop on Rodeo Drive), Bob and Connie 
Abell, David and Ginger Ludwick.

The Vista Del Mar gala drew more than 1,000 guests to dinner at the Century 
Plaza and to the Shubert Theatre for "Jerome Robbins' Broadway." Good news: the 
party grossed $500,000 for family mental health services.

<P>
Sandy and Betty Sigoloff hosted five tables of guests, including Joy and Josh 
Lipman and Sondra and Sy Strasberg. Paramount were Vista's president, George

Jewels from the Diamond Information Center, Faith Porter's whimsies, and 
fashions from Fred Hayman, David Hayes and Nolan Miler were among the 
highlights at show time. Later, Rudy Varon and His Orchestra played for 
dancers. Dean Lynn R. Matteson, who heads the beneficiary, the USC School of 
Fine Arts, said the scholarship fund from the Jewel galas now has an endowment 
of more than $1 million. Matteson also noted proudly that USC quarterback Todd 
Marinovich is an art major. Big donors Eric and Mattie Stanieck were in the 
audience.

Christmas decorating ideas were rampant at the Westside Guild's benefit in 
Brentwood. On preview night, members and their husbands made high bids on 
silent auction items. Holiday greens were everywhere in rooms decorated by Polo 
Ralph Lauren, Williams-Sonoma, Neiman Marcus, Gumps, Terra Cotta, Silver 
Birches, Foster-Ingersoll and Geary's. Giorgio Beverly Hills staged a fashion 
show on the pool diving board. 
</P>
<P>
Prepping for the holidays were Sandy and Turner Smith, Dayle and Kenneth Roath 
(Roath, CEO of Health Care Property Investors, is listed in the new Business 
Week as one of the top 1,000 corporate elite), Charles and Jessie Cale, Barbara 
and Lee Danielson, Marianne and Norman Sprague, Jim and Nancy Birdwell, Dennis 
and Brooks Holt, Liz and Dick Sobelle, Terry and Connie Lynch.
