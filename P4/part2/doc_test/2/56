MORNING BRIEFING: WHEN IT COMES TO BLIND JUSTICE, UMPIRE'S SIGHT IS ALWAYS 
20/20

Dave Hagler, program director for the Los Angeles Sports and the Law chapter, 
is a former referee and umpire who tells the ultimate turnabout-is-fair-play 
story: 
</P>
<P>
"I was driving too fast in the snow in Boulder, Colo., and a policeman pulled 
me over and gave me a speeding ticket. I tried to talk him out of it, telling 
him how worried I was about insurance, etc., and he said I should go to court 
and try to get it reduced or thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
"The first game of the next baseball season, I'm umpiring behind home plate and 
the first batter up is the same policeman. I recognize him, he recognizes me. 
He asks me how the thing went with the ticket. I tell him, 'Swing at 
everything.' " 
</P>
<P>
Just asking: If the position of catcher is so demanding, how is it that Bob 
Boone, Carlton Fisk and Rick Dempsey, all in their 40s, are still playing? 
</P>
<P>
Add Boone: The Philadelphia Phillies gave up on him in 1981 when he was 34. He 
will make more money this year with Kansas City, $1.9 million, than he made in 
all 10 years in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Nolan Ryan had the most strikeouts of any major league pitcher in 
the 1980s. Who was second? 
</P>
<P>
Now-it-can-be-told dept.: Jim Palmer and Joe Morgan, newest members of the 
baseball Hall of Fame, were adversaries in the 1977 All-Star game at Yankee 
Stadium. Morgan tagged Palmer for a leadoff home run. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer: "I went 3-and-2 on Morgan. I knew -- and this is what made him as great 
as he is -- if I walked him, and if he felt good, he'd steal second. If he 
really felt good, he'd steal third. A walk to Joe Morgan was a triple, so I 
took the stupid way out. I threw him a low fastball, and he hit it about 311 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
Deflation: Said Tom Lasorda as he signed baseballs at an autograph show: "This 
signature may not be worth much now, but five years from now it will be worth 
less." 
</P>
<P>
Roomies: From Burt Graeff of the Cleveland Plain Dealer: "Collectively, San 
Antonio rookies David Robinson and Sean Elliott will earn about $5 million this 
season. While most NBA players pay the added expense of having a single room on 
the road, Robinson and Elliott save about $38 a night by doubling up. 
</P>
<P>
Said Coach Larry Brown: "I think Sean does it because he likes David. David 
does it because he likes money." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis, beware: If Loyola Marymount's Hank Gathers fails to make it in the NBA, 
it won't be for lack of confidence. He told USA Today: "Whoever gets me will be 
very lucky. I'm a scorer -- not a shooter. I can put the ball on the floor. I'm 
a Dennis Rodman type, but I'd eat Dennis Rodman alive. I'm a hell of a player 
and I know it." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Dick Vitale, asked the biggest surprise of his life: "When my wife 
said, 'I do.' " HARLEY TINKHAM
