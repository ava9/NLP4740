After the Sacramento Kings drafted University of Louisville center Pervis 
Ellison, club Vice President Bill Russell was asked about Ellison's reputed 
blase behavior.

"There was a kid I used to watch in high school they said that about," Russell 
told the Sporting News. "He just retired at 42 years of age." 
</P>

Add draft: Seton Hall guard John Morton, first choice of the Cleveland 
Cavaliers, said at a news conference: "In the Bronx, I played on courts that 
had a lot of holes in them that helped me with my moves. At Seton Hall, I 
worked on my jump shot to the point where it was just about automatic." 
</P>
<P>
When someone reminded him of his 43% shooting from the floor, he said: "You 
remember I said just about automatic."

Vaughan hit two home runs for the National League.

For what it's worth: David Atchison, UCLA's new golf coach, is a 
great-great-great grandson of former U.S. senator David Rice Atchison

Taylor declined to be inaugurated on a Sunday.

Man's best friend: Abe Lemons, Oklahoma City basketball coach, on the early 
days of his marriage: "I got home one evening, and my young wife met me at the 
door crying. She said the dog had eaten the meat loaf she had fixed for supper, 
but I consoled her and said I'd buy her a new dog." 
</P>

Oops: Said Cincinnati Manager Pete Rose last week when asked about Atlanta 
pitcher John Smoltz: "Believe me, Smoltz is one of the best. I voted for him 
for the All-Star team and I bet . . . oh, I shouldn't say that. I hope he makes 
it."

Would-you-believe-it Dept.: Kansas City's Bo Jackson estimates that he receives

where he will be "a Zen gardener." 
</P>
<P>
He told Owen Canfield of the Hartford Courant: "I'm 38, but I'm old enough to 
retire. I figure each of the 17 times I went through the qualifying school it 
aged me a year, and every year I spent on the tour, seven of them, aged me a 
year. So I'm 62. That's retirement age."
