a 44-year-old mother - appealed at the Republican convention for Americans
to display compassion and understanding to Aids sufferers, instead of
ignorance and silence, Our Foreign Staff reports.
Ms Mary Fisher, daughter of a Detroit real estate investor, said Aids was
not a 'political creature' but affected Democrats and Republicans, blacks
and whites, males and females, in the same brutal way.
Like the Democratic party - whose convention last month heard two people who
were infected with the virus - the Republicans gave her remarks a high
profile. She spoke just before Mrs Marilyn Quayle, wife of the
vice-president, and Mrs Barbara Bush, the president's wife, came to the
podium to speak on a day the convention put aside for 'family values'.
Ms Fisher said she had written to President George Bush and his wife, who
are family friends, to tell them about her disease. She told a TV
interviewer that Mr Bush phoned her immediately after her speech. 'He wanted
to send me his love,' she said.
