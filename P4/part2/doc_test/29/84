The year is 2020. Baby boomers are no longer babies. They are no longer 
booming. They are what the cruel call the Senile Majority. 
</P>
<P>
Dirk Miller, 70, and his wife, Bree Wellington, sixtysomething, are coming out 
of a restaurant when they hear a beggar with a synthesizer playing an old 
Beatles tune, "When I'm 64." 
</P>
<P>
Dirk starts to sing, "When I grow older, losing my brains. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Bree starts laughing. "That's not how it went. It's: 'When I grow older, losing 
my gums, many years from now -- Will ya still be sending me some turpentine, 
something, something, bottle of wine. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever," said Dirk, unplugging the car from the recharging lot. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, that was a great meal," said Bree. "I just love Iraqi food." 
</P>
<P>
"I know, the Date Decadence was to die for," Dirk said, switching on the 
ignition. 
</P>
<P>
"And how about that Camel Hair Pasta?" Bree said, tucking her jowls back under 
the accordion skin flap. "Remember when there was a Vietnamese restaurant in 
that same place?" 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," Dirk admitted, adjusting the lens on the windshield. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," Bree said, opening the drug compartment. "Want a few Vitamin Es -- 
sublingual?" 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks, Hon, but they're included in my subcu pump." 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to get one of those," said Bree. "There was something I wanted to 
talk to you about, but I can't remember." 
</P>
<P>
"Something about Arsenio finally being out of the house?" he said, referring to 
their youngest, Arsenio Kyle Miller-Wellington, who had finally gotten his own 
apartment. Tonight's dinner was in celebration of that event. "It wasn't my 
idea to have a kid in our late 40s." 
</P>
<P>
"That old argument again," Bree said, taking off her nails. "Look, I told you, 
I was afraid that if I waited until menopause the womb transplant wouldn't 
work. How was I to know that in two years we'd have the technology for women to 
have babies until well into their 80s?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," said Dirk, making a right onto Richard Nixon Parkway, "but they never 
came up with the technology for having a teen-ager in your 60s! By the way, I 
hear that with the latest research, women can continue having babies forever. 
Do you believe in birth after death?" 
</P>
<P>
"Research!" said Bree tucking her recently tucked tummy under the air bag 
sensor. "That's what I wanted to tell you about. There's some new research that 
shows that people who smoked marijuana when they were young have a return of 
memory loss from the time they smoked." 
</P>
<P>
"You're kidding," said Dirk, turning off the radio. 
</P>
<P>
"What a minute! Turn that back!" said Bree, scanning. "Damn. You lost that. 
That was my favorite song, 'California Dreamin'.' " 
</P>
<P>
"The Stones, right?" said Dirk, getting off the parkway near the new McDonald's 
Golden Ramen. 
</P>
<P>
"No, not the Stones, Dirk, you dummy. It was The Mamas. The Mamas and the -- I 
can't remember. But I know there was this one Mama who died tragically." 
</P>
<P>
"In the plane crash with Ritchie Valens, wasn't it? Or was she shot as she was 
going into her apartment at the Dakota?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sperm Donors!" said Bree. "It was The Mamas and The Sperm Donors, I think." 
</P>
<P>
Dirk stopped the car and threw up his hands. "OK, I give up. Where is it?" 
</P>
<P>
"Not again, Honey?" said Bree. 
</P>
<P>
But it was understandable. It wasn't senility, it was architectural 
imperialism. Their complex looked just like every other complex in the Demi 
Moore Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Just sit tight," she said, switching on the dashboard homing computer and 
keying in the program to get to their unit at Flossmore, A Community. 
</P>
<P>
Dirk lowered the seat backs and snuggled up next to Bree. 
</P>
<P>
"While we're waiting, can you sing me a little of that song, Bunnynose?" 
</P>
<P>
He hadn't forgotten his old nickname for her, and she hadn't forgotten his. 
"Your request is being processed, Wild Thing." 
</P>
<P>
She stroked his distinguished head and began to sing: 
</P>
<P>
All the leaves are brown 
</P>
<P>
And your implant is gray 
</P>
<P>
Something, something, something -- 
</P>
<P>
If I was in L.A. -- 
</P>
<P>
California dreamin' -- 
</P>
<P>
On such a something day. . .. 
</P>
<P>
 He kissed her chin, where it was recently pulled tightest, and the efficient 
little car dinged its start-up noise and headed home.
