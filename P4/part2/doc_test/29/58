OFFICIAL AND CONFIDENTIAL: THE SECRET LIFE OF J. EDGAR HOOVER
by Anthony Summers
Gollancz Pounds 18.00, 528 pages
SO NOW we know. J. Edgar Hoover, who ran the FBI for 48 years and died in
harness in 1972, was a little bit more than the tough cop and master
bureaucrat whom eight presidents found useful and, whatever their
inclinations, unsackable.
He was, Anthony Summers tell us, not just a 'lifelong bachelor' but a
practising and licentious homosexual with transvestite manifestations. An
expert in the art of blackmail, he used his knowledge of John Kennedy's
sexual excursions with Mafia molls and other security risks to force JFK to
accept Lyndon Johnson, whom he also held in blackmail thrall because of his
affairs, as a running mate. He covered up Bobby Kennedy's association with
the death of Marilyn Monroe which got the young attorney general, with whom
he had a relationship of mutual loathing, off his neck.
It was not only the Kennedys. He knew of a Nixon liaison in Hong Kong and
that brought him security in office, even though he had long passed notional
retirement age and the White House thought he was going crackers.
But he was himself blackmailed, by the Mafia, which first catered to his
passion for gambling illegally on the horses and later used its knowledge of
his sexual inclinations as an effective shield against serious
investigation, not merely into organised crime, but into its involvement in
the assassination of John Kennedy. He was also personally corrupt on a
quietly impressive scale and probably a physical coward. Even his death -
officially in bed and of a heart attack - leaves the odd question
unanswered.
In fact, even if only half of what Mr Summers writes is true, he was a
monster. A lot of people considered Hoover a monster (and a racist) in any
case, for his hounding of every radical and mild dissenter, from Emma
Goldman through Alger Hiss to Martin Luther King. But this was tempered with
a certain respect for the Hoover legend and a grudging admiration for his
extraordinary ability to survive in the political jungle.
Summers, however, offers revisionism in the grand manner and he throws in a
few fashionable retrospective psychoanalyses as well. One of them concludes
that Hoover was suffering from 'a narcissistic disorder with mixed obsessive
features' not unlike the 'perfect Nazi,' Heinrich Himmler, head of Hitler's
secret police. In case the point is missed, comparisons with Stalin's Beria
are also made.
Summers, whose previous book was on Marilyn Monroe, offers impressive
research - 800 interviews and a huge bibliography - and an easy style. But
he is not the first Hoover revisionist. Less sensational and more political
analyses have recently been offered by Richard Gid Powers (1986) and Curt
Gentry (1991). Broadly speaking, Summers picks up on the private Hoover
where the other two, focussing more on the public man, left off. Both Powers
and Gentry note the constant rumours of Hoover's homosexuality, based on his
long relationship with Clyde Tolson, his deputy and constant companion, and
both conclude that the evidence is simply inconclusive. Summers finds it
everywhere, especially in the impressive eye-witness accounts of orgies that
Hoover attended (in New York's Plaza Hotel no less) by the widow of Lewis
Rosensteil.
This is another name to conjure with. Powers merely notes that Rosensteil, a
Prohibition-era bootlegger, became the head of Schenley Industries, the
distillers, while Gentry only parenthetically records Rosensteil's purported
ties to organised crime. Summers's sources delve much deeper, into
Rosensteil's own bisexuality, his connections, political and sexual, with
Joe McCarthy's clique, including Roy Cohn, and above all his closeness to
the Mafia's great financier, Meyer Lansky.
For years, Hoover refused to admit that there was such a thing as organised
crime. That it took the local New York police, not the FBI, to stumble in
1957 on the Mafia summit in Apalachin, has long been known as the great
clear blot on his record as a law enforcement officer, burnished early by
his artfully publicised 'successes' in nailing such gangsters as Dillinger,
Nelson and Karpis in the 1930s. Even after Apalachin, and again after JFK
was assassinated, his attempts to investigate it were suspect, Summers
maintains, because of the hold the Mafia, courtesy mostly of Lewis
Rosensteil, had over him.
Summers also digs up some fascinating nuggets with a British angle - for
example, that Hoover discovered that John Kennedy was linked, via one of his
many sexual encounters, to the Profumo affair in Britain, and that he had
the relationship between Harold Wilson and Marcia Williams (now Lady
Falkender) investigated and served on a plate to LBJ prior to a meeting with
the British prime minister in Washington. George Ball, then undersecretary
of state, described Hoover as 'a malign influence'. Robert McNamara at the
Pentagon told LBJ he was 'a menace' and should be fired.
But he never was, by none of the eight presidents, from Coolidge to Nixon,
that he served. He was given a state funeral, with a eulogy by Nixon, and
the monolithic FBI building on Pennsylvania Avenue, proudly bears his name.
Summers would have him confined to a metaphorical pauper's grave and he
makes a good, if sometimes too conspiratorial, case for so doing. At least
he never became president, though, incredibly, the suggestion was put to him
that he should run by a Kennedy - father Joe no less. It certainly makes you
think.
