OF SEWERS AND SURF: FEAR AND LOATHING ON THE MALIBU CAMPAIGN TRAIL; 
</P>
<P>
CITYHOOD: BEFORE THE SUPERVISORS WILL LET THE 'GLAMOUR CAPITAL' GO, THEY WANT 
TO IMPOSE THEIR SANITIZED VISION ON IT. THE RESULT IS RAW POLITICS.

Once more the deceptively laid-back community of Malibu is aflame with 
political fury. Billed as a fight over cityhood, the issue is actually sewers, 
a subject that has long dominated conversation at Malibu dinner parties. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly, many residents hope to incorporate as a city, free of what they call 
the tyranny of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, the supervisors, wielding both legislative and executive powers, are 
closer to being absolute monarchs than any other elected officials in our 
democracy. As the late Supervisor John Anson Ford told me in 1937, when I was 
trying to persuade him to run for mayor: "Each of the five supervisors enjoys 
twice the clout of any mayor -- and one-fifth of the headaches." 
</P>
<P>
Today's supervisors, with Ed Edelman dissenting, want to impose a comprehensive 
and enormously expensive sewer system on Malibu before they will let it go. 
Without sewers -- the need for them is still a subject for debate -- there can 
be little further development, and developers are primary sources of the funds 
with which supervisors win elections. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors, in particular Deane Dana, in whose district Malibu lies, 
picture themselves as enlightened tribunes whose dreams of progress and 
sanitation are thwarted by the selfish millionaires of Malibu, lolling on their 
exclusive beaches. To the proponents of cityhood, it is a case of the sturdy 
yeomanry of Mailbu protecting their idyllic way of life from the rapacious 
barons of development and their ruthless seneschals, the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the supervisors have reluctantly yielded to a court order and 
scheduled a cityhood election for June 5, with the proviso that incorporation 
be delayed until March 28, 1991, when construction of the sewers could be under 
way. Although the original sewer plan has been greatly reduced by the 
California Coastal Commission, assessments for homeowners have been raised. So 
the battle will continue, with much figurative blood still to flow. 
</P>
<P>
But then, politics in what Malibuites like to think is the glamour capital of 
the world have been tinged with ferocity ever since the redoubtable May K. 
Rindge's armed horsemen patrolled the borders of what was then her private 
estate to fend off railroads, highway and other intrusive tentacles of 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Malibuites have survived many threats to their cherished way of 
life: In the 1950s, it was plans for a nuclear reactor in Corral Canyon; in the 
1960s, projected freeways from Santa Monica and the valley, interchanging near 
Malibu Canyon; in the 1970s, a grandiose plan by the county engineers to create 
a flat coastal plain by filling in all the coastal canyons ("You'll love it," a 
county official told us, "it'll be just like Miami Beach"). 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the warfare was internal. Malibu, with its many movie people, was a 
major battleground during the witch-hunts and blacklists following World War 
II. Like the current war over cityhood, this was not a class struggle. There 
were affluent members of the Communist Party here, and, living in hillside 
shacks, what could be described as right-wing hippies, who packed guns and 
hoarded food against an imminent takeover by the "commie hordes." 
</P>
<P>
In 1947, when I was helping organize a protest against the House Un-American 
Activities Committee, I was severely handicapped by not having a telephone, 
there being a postwar shortage of such amenities. I borrowed the phone of an 
opulent colleague and rang up several-hundred-dollars' worth of calls to 
congressmen, journalists and New York theater people, enlisting their support 
and detailing our plans for a protest flight of stars to Washington. I was 
surprised by the distress my action evoked in my colleague, even as I handed 
over a check for the full amount. Years later, I learned that I had broadcast 
our plans over the telephone, probably tapped, of a stalwart member of the 
Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Far less opulent was a handyman my wife and I employed, an equally stalwart 
member of the John Birch Society. He always asked for payment in cash, and when 
he died he left not only a large collection of guns, but bundles of cash 
concealed in lavatory cisterns, pillows and even garbage cans. I'm not saying 
that all was extremism in Malibu politics. My neighbor Kyle Palmer, then 
political editor of The Times and widely believed to be the de facto Republican 
boss of California, joined with me in launching charity drives in the community 
-- and I had, quite erroneously, been identified by national political 
columnist Drew Pearson as Kyle's Democratic counterpart. So here and there 
political sweetness and light prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
But not much of it is in evidence today. As for the June election, my hunch is 
that cityhood will win, despite the combined political muscles of developers, 
land speculators and Pepperdine University, whose plans for massive expansion 
depend on the supervisors' regional sewers. I base my guess not on the 
unpopularity of the sewer system itself and its huge assessments but the 
problem presented by Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
PCH, as we Malibuites call it, is possibly the worst thoroughfare in all 
America. It is at once a principal route north, the commuter road not only for 
thousands of Malibuites but for commuters from inland developments who want to 
avoid Ventura Freeway gridlock. It is used by local shoppers and Los Angeles 
beach-goers, by tourists, by hundreds of bicyclists, by California Highway 
Patrol cars and ambulances screaming toward the all-too-frequent accidents, and 
by joggers and casual strollers in swimsuits, often accompanied by dogs, on and 
off the leash. If the traffic can move at all, to observe the 45 m.p.h. speed 
limit is to be tailgated, rear-ended, shouted at and even shot at. 
</P>
<P>
There is absolutely no way that PCH can accommodate a huge buildup of traffic, 
and that will be on the minds of many voters. Even the developers must wonder 
how they can hope to sell choice properties if the buyers can't get in or out. 
</P>
<P>
But this is Malibu, where anything can happen. In 1962, Richard M. Nixon ran 
for governor of California, and looked like a shoo-in until the extreme right 
challenged him in the Republican primary with Joe Shell, a former USC football 
player. Malibu was ablaze with Shell bumper stickers and billboards, with Shell 
posters on every power pole. There were Shell meetings, barbecues and parades. 
Malibu Republicans, in effect, were so Shell-shocked that they seemed quite 
ready to jettison their quondam national standard-bearer. One day my wife was 
driving our children home from school when our 10-year-old spotted a car with a 
Nixon sticker. "Look, Mommie!" she cried -- "Liberals!" 
</P>
<P>
I have often wondered if Nixon lost the final election to Edmund G. (Pat) Brown 
Sr. because enough rightists with 10-year-old mentalities mistook him for a 
liberal. In Malibu, it is unwise to bet the ranch on anything.
