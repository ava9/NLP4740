  [Text] Beijing, 23 Apr (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier 
Zhu Rongji sent a telegram on 23 April to condole the death of 
former U.S. President Richard Nixon. The full text of the 
telegram follows: 
  Mr. Nixon was a statesman with foresight and sagacity. He 
always cared about Sino-U.S. relations. He visited China seven 
times, made important contributions to the improvement and 
development of the two countries' relations, and had the respect 
of the Chinese people. I wish to express my profound condolences 
on his death, and also my sincere sympathy for Mr. Nixon's 
family.
