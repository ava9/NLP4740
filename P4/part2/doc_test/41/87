<TEXT>
A microscopic parasitic worm known as the nematode has been plaguing crops
all over the world. But a Central American tree is providing a new way to
fight it.
Nematodes attack many crops. In some cases they can be combated with
existing synthetic solutions. However, these are too toxic for plantation
crops, such as bananas.
The new treatment, DMDP, has been developed by the Royal Botanical Gardens
at Kew and the Scottish Crop Research institute, from the seeds and leaves
of a Costa Rican tree. It is potentially far less toxic than synthetic
treatments.
DMDP is being further developed by Inbio, a Costa Rican conservation
organisation, based in Heredia, which is using aerial photographs from Nasa
to identify donor trees.
Inbio: Costa Rica, 36 7690.
