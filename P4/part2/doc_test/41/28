The million machine link-up - Internet Boom: the world's largest-ever

THE worldwide telephone network has been described as the biggest machine
ever built, and has certainly brought about some of the biggest changes in
human existence this century. It now has a rapidly growing rival: the
worldwide Internet.
The Internet is not a single network; it is the biggest collection of
computer networks ever linked together. It connects around a million
machines and new subscribers are joining at a rate of 100,000 per month  - a
growth of ten per cent each month.
Like the phone network, Internet gives global connectivity: access to any
other machine connected to the system. This gives the equivalent of a
facsimile connection direct to any other user. But computers in contact can
offer further services, from electronic mail onwards.
Despite this, few people have heard of the Internet, and business users are
only just beginning to exploit it as a resource.
The first commercial services in the UK began in 1992, and have grown
rapidly. Pipex, run by Unipalm of Cambridge, with a service that costs from
Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 10,000 per year, is taking Pounds 100,000 each month
in subscription fees and has 78 subscribers.
Each Pipex subscriber gets a connection to their office and can link their
whole internal network to the worldwide Internet. One of Internet's great
advantages over other services such as X25 is the fact that Internet
protocols are the same as those used on many local area networks.
So far, Pipex subscribers include such companies as Barclays Bank, Eagle
Star, Guardian Royal Exchange, Powergen, the British Library, and City firms
such as Trygg-Hansa. Many people in these companies use Internet without
realising it.
On a smaller scale, Demon Internet Services offers a simpler connection for
home users and smaller businesses, at a cost of Pounds 10 a month. The
service started as a sideline in June 1992, when software house Demon
Systems decided to spread the cost of its own Internet connection.
'We planned to get 200 to 400 people,' says Grahame Davis of Demon Internet
Services. 'We've now got 750 people, and that is rising at about 100 per
month.'
If this continues the service will have to be turned into a fully-fledged
line of business, or sold off.
Other ways into the Internet include gateways available from several
bulletin boards such as Compulink Information Exchange (CIX) and mail
services such as Compuserve. Most of these will forward electronic mail, but
some give access to other Internet services.
Internet has been hidden from view because it was developed for academic
traffic and first boomed in linking research workers. It is also based on de
facto standard protocols which are out of favour in official circles.
The Internet began with the US Department of Defense's ARPAnet, which began
with four machines in 1969. During the 1970s, ARPAnet was linked with other
networks and developed its own standard protocols, called TCP/IP. Other
protocols including the OSI standards were used on the nets, but only
experimentally.
More and more networks joined the Internet during the 1980s.
Europe was slowest to adopt the service, possibly due to official pressure
to adopt services which use the rival OSI protocols. Strangely, the Internet
was developed with US public money, despite the fact that North America also
has an OSI policy. Much of the funding came indirectly, through researchers'
salaries. In 1992, control of the Internet and its protocols passed from a
self-appointed committee to a new body called the Internet Society, in a bid
to make the Internet more acceptable in official circles.
The Society also plans to raise development funds for the Internet.
In the meantime, the growth of the Internet may bring its own problems. As
its exponential growth continues, it will have to create new 'addresses' -
the electronic 'telephone numbers' assigned to each system on the network.
With telephone numbers, this is done by adding extra digits, as in London's
recent change from 01 to 071/081, and the extra 1 soon to appear in all UK
phone numbers. On a network, the solution is similar.
However, there are technical and political dimensions to the situation. The
Internet protocols are old, and a change of addressing would be a good time
to introduce new versions of them.
This has sparked an argument over which protocols to use, and how to
structure addresses.
The Internet Society is taking the matter seriously, but some Internet
promoters believe it has been blown out of proportion.
'The issue has become an opportunity for some unscrupulous people to sow
doubt about the Internet,' says Mr Dawe. 'The Internet is adapting to the
continued tidal wave of users. The problem has been well forecast and there
will be minimal disruption caused.'
OSI protocols have been suggested, notably by Richard des Jardins, a
lecturer and consultant based in Washington DC, and one of the original
architects of OSI. He believes that governments and the phone companies will
create a parallel OSI-based Internet: 'Why let a second Internet get
started, even if the TCP/IP Internet is dominant? The only interests that
would be served would be the hardliners on both sides and the vendors who
make money on unnecessary duality.'
If the Internet adopted the OSI protocols alongside its own, it would be a
basis for an 'international dial-tone,' claims Dr DesJardins. 'The
alternative is the internet equivalent of one half of the world using one
electrical power standard, and the other half using a different and
incompatible standard, and trying to plug into each other.'
The Internet community do not see it that way: they object that the
protocols are too 'heavyweight.' They are not being run over users' internal
networks, so the solution would destroy the homogeneity currently available.
And, says Peter Dawe of Unipalm, the system is too complex: 'OSI also allows
too many addresses - enough to address every single particle in the
universe, individually.'
In the short-term, the Internet has come up with a system to redistribute
the existing addresses and get more use from them. In the next two years,
the Internet Society will choose a new protocol (OSI or not), which will run
alongside the existing Internet - 'the two networks will run concurrently
and transparently,' says Mr Dawe. 'Over time, systems will phase over to the
new one.'
Whatever the solution to the technical issues, the Internet seems set to
keep growing. It is a demonstration of what can be achieved with a simple
practical approach to networking, and an example of how to use government
money in a well-controlled project.
'The Internet is going ballistic,' says Dan Lynch, president of Interop,
which organises events for the Internet community.
'It cannot survive technically much longer without some strong central
(worldwide) operational collective that sorts out routing and directory
service issues. I have hoped that the 'phone companies' of the world would
figure out how great an opportunity they have to provide these services but,
thus far, they have squandered their lead. But someone will get it together.
There are just too many trillions of marks to be made.'
