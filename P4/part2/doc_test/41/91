  [Text] Guinea worm cases in the country reduced by 46 
percent between January and June, this year, as compared to 35 
percent reduction recorded for the same period in 1992. 
  During the first half of this year, a total of 13,966 guinea 
worm cases were reported throughout the country compared to 
25,966 cases reported during the same period last year. 
  This is contained in the July 1993 report of Global 2000 
Guinea Worm Project, a copy of which was made available to the 
GRAPHIC at Saltpond or Thursday after a workshop for 35 
guinea-worm eradication volunteers. 
  The report noted that with the possible exception of the 
Northern Region, the number of infested villages is sufficiently 
small enough that a monthly visit by the co-ordinators to each 
endemic village would ensure the adoption of preventive measures. 
  A supplementary report on the Central Region signed by Dr. 
Richard Yaw Osei, Regional Director of Health Services also 
stated that the region achieved 100 percent filter distribution 
to about 42,000 households in December last year. It stated a 
survey carried out in January this year indicated that 80 
percent of the population actually used the monofilterment 
filters but 20 percent were worn out due to vigorous washing. 
  It said 120 endemic communities have been supplied with 
potable water since 1989 while about 130 endemic communities 
have been earmarked for potable water by the end of 1993.
