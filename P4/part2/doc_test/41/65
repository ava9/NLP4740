<P>
The Third World is faced with numerous health and economic problems, but there 
is one little-recognized scourge that represents a significant roadblock to 
future prosperity in Third World countries: intestinal worms. 
</P>
<P>
Diseases caused by parasites are a diverse group ranging from malaria to a 
number of illnesses that are largely unknown in developed countries and which 
require a variety of methods to control. A special category are the intestinal 
parasites, which until recently have received less attention because they have 
been considered to be relatively innocuous. The most common examples are 
hookworm, roundworm and whipworm. 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies indicate that infections by these worms play a much larger role 
in sapping energy and well-being than previously believed. And the studies have 
spurred an increase in drug treatment of the afflictions, an approach that has 
proved highly controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps only famine and malaria exceed intestinal worm infections as the 
leading producers of misery and economic loss in the developing world. 
International health experts estimate that the number of individuals infected 
today worldwide probably equals, or may even exceed, the number infected 50 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
They say at least one-fourth of the 5 billion people living today have worms, 
often more than one kind. The vast majority are the same individuals in the 
developing world for whom malnutrition is also a primary cause of illness and 
lethargy. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps as many as half of all cases of severe child malnutrition . . . are 
precipitated not primarily by the lack of food but by intestinal parasites, 
fever and infection -- especially diarrheal infection -- which depresses the 
appetite, burns the energy and drains away the body weight of the child," 
declares James P. Grant, executive director of the United Nations Children's 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Experts warn that the problem of parasitic diseases in developing countries is 
so serious that neither economic development, population control nor foreign 
aid will suffice to foster prosperity in those countries until the diseases are 
controlled. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Andrew Davis, director of parasitic diseases for the World Health 
Organization, says: "It is unrealistic to expect rapid advancement in Third 
World countries, which, in addition to their economic misfortunes, are totally 
overburdened with crushing disease problems that diminish output of both 
individuals and communities." 
</P>
<P>
It has been known since the last century that sanitary facilities, clean water 
and personal hygiene are the ways to control intestinal worms. Except for 
pockets of infection due largely to refugee populations, that is why intestinal 
worms are not a major problem in the United States. International aid agencies 
have striven most of this century to improve sanitation and public awareness of 
sanitation's essential role in the Third World by funding water purification 
and latrine-building projects and health education programs. 
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization currently is winding up a decade-long thrust to 
extend drinking water and sanitation services to hundreds of millions of people 
living in rural and urban slums. While gains have been made and the push will 
continue, UNICEF estimates that 800 million people still will be without access 
to safe water supplies and 1.3 billion will lack adequate sanitation services. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is the difficulty of persuading the people to change eons of 
habit by using latrines, which they view as confining and a nuisance to 
maintain. In one Mexican village where health workers finally managed to get 
the residents to use newly installed pit latrines, the cooperation ended 
abruptly when a child fell through the seat opening. 
</P>
<P>
Although a wide selection of anti-worm drugs have been available for some time, 
physicians working in the developing world have been reluctant to use them on a 
wide scale. They believe that the absence of adequate sanitation facilities and 
good hygiene make widespread drug treatment economically useless because 
individuals soon become reinfected. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, there have been signs that the traditional attitude toward 
drug treatment may be changing -- but not without opposition from those who 
fear that treatment may lead to diminished attention to prevention through 
sanitation. In the last several years new studies have indicated that treating 
heavily infected children within a community has health benefits to the whole 
community that may justify the cost -- even though the youngsters subsequently 
do become reinfected. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Michael C. Latham, director of the international nutrition 
program at Cornell University, studies over the last five years are revealing 
that the health consequences of infection in children -- the most vulnerable 
age group -- are far more serious than previously believed. For example, of the 
1 billion people infected with roundworm, about a million acquire intestinal 
obstructions that result in between 50,000 and 100,000 deaths a year, according 
to Latham. 
</P>
<P>
Roundworms, hookworms and whipworms also enhance the debilitating effects of 
malnutrition by causing anemia or decreasing absorption of nutrients or sapping 
the energy that comes from the protein in food, resulting in stunted growth and 
increased vulnerability to other infections. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent study conducted in Kenya, Latham and other researchers from the 
Kenya Medical Research Institute and McMaster University in Canada showed that 
treating children with a single dose of an anti-worm drug, albendazole, brought 
highly significant improvements in growth rates over untreated children. The 
drug is seen as valuable because it is effective against each of the life-cycle 
stages of all three kinds of worms. 
</P>
<P>
Treating a few thousand children in a study and getting good results is one 
thing, said Dr. Clive Shiff of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, but 
even for international agencies it's another thing to do it on a global scale. 
"It's ethically needed," he said, "but not affordable." Nevertheless, according 
to Dr. Peter Schantz of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, interest in the 
drug approach is sufficient for CDC to be planning its own field trials to 
verify the positive findings of the Kenya and Montserrat studies.
