The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is providing the public an opportunity to comment on a draft report entitled ``Estimated
Non-Radioactive Demolition and Site Restoration Costs for the Reference PWR Power Station.'' This draft report
was prepared for the NRC under subcontract to Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL). The report provides information
on the estimated cost to restore a reference PWR to a ``green field'' status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This report should be viewed as a supplement to a previously published draft NUREG/CR&hyph;5884 entitled ``Revised
Analyses of Decommissioning for the Reference Pressurized Water Reactor Power Station.'' The staff plans to include
this draft report in the finalized version of NUREG/CR&hyph;5884 after all public comments are resolved. A similar
analysis was prepared and included in a recently released (59 FR 55299) draft NUREG/CR&hyph;6174 entitled ``Revised
Analyses of Decommissioning for the Reference Boiling Water Reactor Power Station'' which is out for public comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Single copies of the draft report may be obtained by written request from RPHEB Secretary, Office of Nuclear Regulatory
Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. A copy of the draft report is also available
for inspection and/or copying for a fee in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington,
DC. For those that wish to access the draft report via personal computer, it is available on the NRC Electronic Bulletin
Board on FedWorld.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments and suggestions on the draft report should be sent to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of
Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments may also be submitted electronically, in either ASCII text or Wordperfect format (version 5.1 or later),
by calling the NRC Electronic Bulletin Board on FedWorld. The bulletin board may be accessed using a personal computer,
a modem, and one of the commonly available communications software packages, or directly via Internet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If using a personal computer and modem, the NRC subsystem on FedWorld can be accessed directly by dialing the toll free
number: 1&hyph;800&hyph;303&hyph;9672. Communication software parameters should be set as follows: parity to
none, data bits to 8, and stop bits to 1 (N,8,1). Using ANSI terminal emulation, the NRC NUREG and Reg Guide Comments
subsystem can then be accessed by selecting the ``Subsystems/Databases'' option from the ``NRC Main Menu.'' For
further information about options available for NRC at FedWorld consult the ``Help/Information Center'' from the
``NRC Main Menu.'' Users will find the ``FedWorld Online User's Guides''' particularly helpful. Many NRC subsystems
and databases also have a ``Help/Information Center'' option that is tailored to the particular subsystem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC subsystem on FedWorld can also be accessed by a direct dial phone number for the main FedWorld BBS: 703&hyph;321&hyph;8020;
Telnet via Internet: fedworld.gov (192.239.92.3); File Transfer Protocol (FTP) via Internet: ftp.fedworld.gov
(192.239.92.205); and World Wide Web using; http://www.fedworld.gov (this is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If using a method other than the toll free number to contact FedWorld, then the NRC subsystem will be accessed from the
main FedWorld menu by selecting the ``U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission'' option from FedWorld's ``Subsystems/Databases''
menu or by entering the command ``/go nrc'' at a FedWorld command line. If you access NRC from FedWorld's ``Subsystems/Databases''
menu, then you may return to FedWorld by selecting the ``Return to FedWorld'' option from the ``NRC Main Menu.'' However,
if you access NRC at FedWorld by using NRC's toll-free number, then you will have full access to all NRC systems, but
you will not have access to the main FedWorld system. For more information on NRC bulletin boards call Mr. Arthur Davis,
Systems Integration and Development Branch, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone
(301) 415&hyph;5780; e-mail AXD3@nrc.gov.

Copies of the comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level),
