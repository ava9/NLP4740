WORMS, the French holding company, has reshuffled its interests by selling a
controlling stake in Financiere Truffaut, the luxury goods conglomerate, to
Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman of the LVMH group, and reducing its holding in
the Saint-Louis food company.
Truffaut holds investments in a number of luxury goods companies including
25 per cent of the Kenzo fashion house and 17 per cent investment in Fred,
the jeweller. It owns a 10.7 per cent stake in Agache, a company through
which Mr Arnault controls LVMH, and 1.4 per cent of Christian Dior, the
fashion house linked to LVMH.
Mr Arnault, one of France's most ambitious industrialists, has bought
Worms's 94.3 per cent stake in Truffaut in a deal that values the latter at
FFr872m (Dollars 161.5m). The acquisition not only expands his luxury goods
interests, but also strengthens his position at Agache and LVMH.
Worms, which recently reported a sharp fall in net profits to FFr571m last
year from FFr1bn in 1991, has raised capital to stabilise its finances. The
Truffaut sale continues its strategy of concentrating on businesses where it
exercises control. Truffaut, by contrast, is composed of minority stakes.
Under the terms of the deal, Worms will keep Truffaut's 20 per cent holding
in Lancel, the French luggage company, because of the possible conflict with
Louis Vuitton, the luxury luggage maker owned by LVMH.
Worms has restructured its investment in Saint-Louis, the French food group.
It has struck a concert agreement with IFIL, a fellow shareholder linked to
the Agnelli family of Italy, so that they will jointly control Saint-Louis.
Saint-Louis recently staged a capital increase to finance its expansion
plans and Worms ceded its rights to buy new shares to IFIL. As a result, the
two companies control 47.5 per cent of the equity and 56.7 per cent of the
voting rights, with IFIL raising its stake to 15.6 per cent from 6.5 per
cent and Saint-Louis reducing its holding to 31.9 per cent from 36 per cent.
