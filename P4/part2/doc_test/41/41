<F P=106> [Article by krzem, irem, PAP: "premier@urm.gov.pl; Mr. Prime </F>
Minister on Computer"] 
  [Text] If you have a computer, a telephone, and a modem 
and pay 1.5 million zlotys [Z] to open an account on the 
Internet and Z1.5 million a month in subscription fees, from 
today on you can send your opinions to Prime Minister Pawlak. 
  It will be enough to put the following address: 
premier@urm.gov.pl. You can also write it in 
English--primeminister@urm.gov.pl.--and it will reach the 
addressee as well. 
  The prime minister gave these addresses yesterday in the 
government's holiday center in Lansk, during the Forum of the 
Association for the Development of Open Systems, which was held 
in Lansk. Pawlak is the second high-ranking politician who has 
revealed his address on the Internet. The other one is U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, who made his address available on the 
Internet a year ago: president@whitehouse.gov. The first 
message Prime Minister Pawlak sent was greetings to President 
Clinton. 
  How does it work? All of the computers in the Office of the 
Council of Ministers [URM] (including the ones that are on the 
desk of the prime minister) are linked to one another by a 
so-called network. Their users can send messages to each other. 
  Yesterday, URM joined the world Internet system, a huge 
computer network that already includes 65 countries (such as the 
U.S., Canada, the countries of Western Europe, Japan, and, for 
over a year--Poland). In America, increasingly more companies 
give not only their fax numbers but also their addresses in the 
computer mail (so-called e-mail). 
  Where did the Internet come from? More than 10 years ago, 
the Pentagon tasked research institutes and armament enterprises 
with creating a system of computer communications. One 
university after another joined the system so the network became 
available to all scientists. Recently, it has even become 
available to every owner of a personal computer, a modem, and a 
telephone. 
  In Poland, the users of this network are mainly universities 
and institutes--35,000 people in 220 institutions. The 
installation costs are covered by the Scientific Research 
Committee. Other users (a few dozen, including GAZETA) must pay 
Z1.5 million to open an account in the network, and a monthly 
subscription fee of Z1.5 million. The system is installed by 
the Warsaw-based company ATM.
