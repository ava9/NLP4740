THE government will on Friday give the formal go-ahead for the construction
of the Pounds 1.7bn extension of the Underground's Jubilee Line to Canary
Wharf in London's Docklands, Robert Peston writes.
Barring last-minute hitches, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary; Sir
Wilfred Newton, chairman of London Transport; and Sir Brian Unwin, president
of the European Investment Bank, are planning to announce that all hurdles
to the construction have been cleared.
The last barrier to authorisation of the scheme is court approval for Canary
Wharf, the Docklands property development, to come out of administration
under UK insolvency procedures.
Only if Canary Wharf comes out of administration and is reconstituted as a
going concern will the project's bankers provide the Pounds 400m
contribution to the costs which the government has made a condition of the
extension being built. The High Court is expected to allow Canary Wharf to
come out of administration on Friday.
