LONDON DOCKLANDS has always needed its visionaries and dreamers. The last
three years, however, have been more likely to generate nightmares.
The 5,000-acre riverside sprawl to the east of the British capital, a
world-class experiment in urban regeneration and a marble-clad totem to the
forces of free enterprise, was born at the dawn of Britain's entrepreneurial
renaissance.
The economic boom years of the 1980s gave it a flying start as it set about
showing the sceptics and the small-minded how government and business could
unite behind a Pounds 10bn budget to transform dereliction and decay into a
21st century, wealth-creating community.
But as the debate intensified over the logic of a strategy which built
skyscrapers first and roads second, so the swift transition from economic
boom to recession piled problem upon problem down in the docks.
The story of how golden promise turned to dark despair has been well
catalogued. An upstart rival to the centuries-old City on its doorstep,
dockland's ability to usurp the traditional role of the Square Mile was
always in question. The collapse of the UK economy - and in financial
services and the south-east, in particular, seemed to provide the answer.
Land which had doubled in value between 1986 and 1987 was now unsaleable,
along with the apartments which had boasted jacuzzis and six noughts on the
end of their asking prices. Companies which had been on the brink of moving
in, pulled back; new development ground to a halt as the inventory of empty
space rocketed,
The crisis of confidence seemed to spread to those with responsibility for
docklands, both within the London Docklands Development Corporation and in
Whitehall. The Department of the Environment, having raised expectations,
decided against moving its own staff to the area.
The spectacular collapse of Canary Wharf, the most grandiose property scheme
from the world's most ambitious property developer, also threw into doubt
the future of the crucial, Pounds 1.8bn Jubilee line underground extension.
The government expressed regret - from the sidelines.
'Last September was the low point,' recalls Mr Eric Sorensen, LDDC chief
executive. 'There seemed to be very little more that could be added to our
problems.
Beyond Docklands, the public impression was that the entire project had shut
down, that the area was set to revert to a wilderness. Yet the doom and
gloom about what was always going to be a long-term project, with its fair
share of ups and downs, may always have been a bit overdone.
In Dockland's darkest hour, more than 61,000 people were living there, a
similar number were employed there and 2,500 businesses were operating
there. The economic fault lines could not detract, either, from the sheer
physical achievements of some of the most enterprising developers and
designers.
But the statistics were of little comfort in the immediate crisis. Mr
Sorensen says, however, there was 'no point in whistling the wind.'
The best contribution was to press on with efforts to ensure that the
all-important transport links were developed - 'it was not just about
physical construction; it was psychologically important for the whole area
that we should make progress,' he adds.
THE LDDC has worked hard in helping to get the Jubilee line extension back
on track and, following agreement by the European Investment Bank to inject
Pounds 98m into the project, believes an important corner has been turned. A
final go-ahead, however, is still awaited.
Other, recent events have conspired to offer some hope that the worst really
might be over. Canary Wharf could soon be out of the hands of
administrators, while the ill-fated docklands light railway is improving its
unreliable image and expanding its network.
The opening this month of the controversial docklands highway, a dual
carriageway running from the city to the London City Airport, will transform
access, although there are fears of serious congestion around Tower Hill.
The airport itself is set for a significant expansion of its continental
services, though the complex remains a loss-making enterprise and operators,
Mowlem, have failed to find a partner to help them bear the cost. Its claim
of being a 15-minute taxi ride from the city should now, at least, be met.
There are also hopes that the end of recession will more generally stimulate
economic activity and allow Docklands to put its worst period behind it.
Caution prevails but there are some straws in the wind.
Local housing agents say that there has been an improvement in interest
among potential buyers and the commercial property market - sagging under
the weight of unwanted floorspace - is being encouraged by the arrival of
some significant occupiers.
Texaco, the US-owned energy group has just moved 1,000 headquarters staff
from London's west end into Canary Wharf while Credit Suisse First Boston
has brought in another 1,500. Canary Wharf, the giant 'white elephant,' now
has 6,500 people working in it. Other arrivals include Peat Marwick, Morgan
Stanley and Tower Hamlets council, with its 800 staff. Mirror Group
Newspapers is also said to be considering a move into Docklands.
The LDDC itself says it is no longer keeping its head down on the
development front. As the authority vested with ownership of 550 acres of
local land, it is again marketing some of its sites in a new air of
optimism. It intends to release 25 small building sites this year and is
brushing off previously aborted plans for an exhibition centre close to the
Royal Docks. The corporation is also keen to pursue ambitious plans for an
urban village on a 70-acre site in the same locality. It could ultimately be
home for up to 5,000 people.
Housing developers are also back in business, with Barrett London and
Fairview New Homes developing nearly 400 new homes between them. The
emphasis, in contrast to the 1980s, is going to be on lower-cost housing,
with prices on one of the developments starting at only Pounds 39,000.
Foreign investment interest is also perking up, with the Bank of China
recently completing the purchase of a block of 48 apartments on the Isle of
Dogs. New efforts to attract inward investors from overseas are being made
by the LDDC.
The position of Docklands as a vital, commercial bridgehead to the east of
London was recently endorsed by the government when it announced plans for a
'golden corridor' of development running along both sides of the Thames as
far as Tilbury and Sheerness.
The proposals were immediately welcomed by the LDDC as evidence of the
government's commitment to building up the economy to the east of the
capital. Mr Michael Howard, the Environment Secretary, slapped down 'critics
and doom mongers' to suggest that Docklands will resume its growth once the
economy gets under steam.
He was announcing the creation of a task force to spearhead long-term
economic development along the so-called East Thames Corridor. The intention
is to have a planning framework in place by March 1994.
Already, however, there are critics of the proposals, who point out that
such a strategy could suck development away from the west of London. They
also stress that much of the relevant land to the east of the capital has
been ravaged by years of industrial misuse.
Though Mr Howard spoke of docklands as a 'great success story,' his plans
for further expansion to the east clearly revealed that lessons have been
learned in high places.
A key to the plans will be in ensuring that the development of the corridor
co-incides with an extensive infrastructure programme. A more flexible
strategy will also mean less concentration on office developments and the
provision of a broader range of integrated projects.
The minister envisaged 100,000 new homes and 100,000 extra jobs in a decade.
Virtually the same targets are shared by Docklands itself. May the best
dream win.
