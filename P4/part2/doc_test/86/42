TAIL THAT'S LIGHT BY HENRY REALBIRD

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Goin' on fresh snow, 
</P>
<P>
Snow's been fallin' 
</P>
<P>
Several days, 
</P>
<P>
The ground, all is white, 
</P>
<P>
Sagebrush tops 
</P>
<P>
Stickin' out of snow; 
</P>
<P>
Ridin' through snow, it's quiet 
</P>
<P>
River where it goes. 
</P>
<P>
Just the trees are black, 
</P>
<P>
The ground, all is white; 
</P>
<P>
Where there are pine trees 
</P>
<P>
It's sorta blue, almost black 
</P>
<P>
Still farther beyond 
</P>
<P>
Wolf Teeth Mountains, pine trees are blue, 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing but the cold wind 
</P>
<P>
Look sorta like smoke; 
</P>
<P>
Ash trees, where they're thick 
</P>
<P>
It is black. 
</P>
<P>
Gray I'm ridin', 
</P>
<P>
His breath is white, 
</P>
<P>
Gray . . . ground he is like this day. 
</P>
<P>
My song, I'm singin' 
</P>
<P>
Lookin' around 
</P>
<P>
Where the sun appears 
</P>
<P>
Pink, peeps out of blue sky; 
</P>
<P>
Goin' to get many horses 
</P>
<P>
Ridin' gray, they won't see me 
</P>
<P>
In white gray, blue black winter day; 
</P>
<P>
My song, I'm singin'. 
</P>

From "New Cowboy Poetry" (Peregrine Smith Books/Gibbs Smith: $9.95, paper; 165 
pp.; 0-87905-243-0). Edited and with an introduction by Hal Cannon: "This 
poetry is utilitarian -- heavy duty, industrial-strength poetry. It is meant to 
be read aloud. . . . This book is meant to be carried with you in the glove box 
of a pickup truck, the back pocket of a worn pair of pants, even a saddlebag."
