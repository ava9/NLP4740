Pinus pinea 
</P>
<P>
Italian stone pine 
</P>
<P>
Tall evergreen tree with upswept branches and 5-inch cones 
</P>
<P>
Those Romans knew a good tree when they saw it: They planted stone pines along 
the Appian Way when Rome was still an empire, and although the empire is long 
gone, many of the trees are still there. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Southern California, our Mediterranean climate is just like the 
stone pine's native habitat: hot and dry in the summer, warm and almost dry in 
the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Stone pines laugh at drought and sneer at rich soil. They will tolerate 
temperatures lower than their sunny heritage would suggest, but no lower than 
10 degrees for more than a couple of nights. This gorgeous tree looks wonderful 
at the beach, along wide boulevards and on an estate large enough to 
accommodate it (it is especially comfortable next to Italian cypress). 
</P>
<P>
But once it grows beyond its plump infancy, it can look dreadful in a small 
yard or anywhere its growth is constricted and its size out of proportion. It 
wants to loom. 
</P>
<P>
The stone pine (also called umbrella pine) has three distinct shapes as it 
grows; when a youth, it's a dense, roundish, cute little thing with blue-green 
needles; as a 6- to 10-foot teen-ager, its trunk extends and thickens, the 
leaves turn green, the top rounds off and the branches curve upward -- a sturdy 
lollipop on a stick. But when it hits its old age, 80-feet-tall prime, the top 
flattens and widens, and it really does resemble an umbrella -- inside-out, but 
an umbrella nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Italian stone pines are the source of pine nuts, those expensive nuggets so 
dear to Italian cuisine. It takes three years for nuts to mature to the edible 
stage; the scales open and fall to the ground before the cones, which remain on 
the branches. 
</P>
<P>
The stone pine's needles are in twos; needle-counting is important with pines 
because it provides a clue to what pests and diseases may afflict the trees. 
The stone pine is relatively pest-free in Southern California but not always 
healthy. Smog can damage and even kill pines, but so far the stone pine seems 
to be breathing easily. 
</P>
<P>
Some spectacular stone pines are lined up by the entrance to the Los Angeles 
State and County Arboretum in Arcadia and all over the UCLA campus in Westwood. 
A few stone pines have been planted as street trees in West Los Angeles, but 
not nearly enough. 
</P>
<P>
In San Pedro's Point Fermin Park, many venerable stone pines, Moreton Bay figs 
and other trees were destroyed or mutilated when the park was "renovated" two 
years ago. They are mourned. 
</P>
<P>
For the gardener who wants to grow some Italian tradition -- something a little 
more substantial than oregano -- stone pines are an excellent investment, but 
only for large gardens or generous parkways. It's just plain cruel to plant 
this lovely tree in what amounts to an outdoor closet. 
</P>
<P>
Stone pines should be readily available in most Southern California nurseries; 
if they're not actually in stock, they are easily ordered. JUDITH SIMS
