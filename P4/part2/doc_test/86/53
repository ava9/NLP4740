  [Text] Forestry Minister Xu Youfang arrived at the 
forefront of the (Hongba) forest fire site on 20 April to direct 
the operation of extinguishing the fire. After hearing a 
briefing on efforts to extinguish the forest fire, Minister Xu 
Youfang relayed the following four directives by the State 
Council: 
  1. Efforts should be made to adopt practical and effective 
measures for the operation and to make use of topographical 
advantages to create a separation gap and to pay attention to 
watching the fire situation. 
  2. We should be determined to concentrate strong forces on 
waging a battle and make good arrangements for ensuring support 
services for the safety of personnel. 
  3. We should maintain close contact with the meteorological 
departments and be aware of weather changes at all times. 
  4. We should report the disaster situation to the State 
Council at all times. 
  Minister Xu Youfang said: The pine trees of Zhangzi species 
are rare and the forest zones of such trees are the state 
wealth. The State Council attaches great importance on the seed 
forest base of Zhangzi-species pine trees in the Honghuaerqu 
forestry administration bureau. Thus, the struggle against the 
forest fire is important and greatly significant. The 
organizational and commanding work undertaken by the 
headquarters to extinguish the fire should be keyed up and 
carried out in a orderly manner. Responsibilities for the 
operation should be clearly defined, in addition, the policies 
and orders should be carried out in a unified manner. 
Meanwhile, efforts should be made to ensure support services to 
avoid missing opportunities to fight the fire.
