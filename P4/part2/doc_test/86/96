SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Coastal Commission agreed unanimously Friday to approve the 
first phase of a sprawling scientific research park atop Torrey Pines Mesa, but 
delayed a decision on the rest of the proposal because of environmental 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Sierra Club and homeowners around the site of the 300-acre 
Torrey Pines Science Center asked for the two-month delay so local residents 
can voice worries during the commission's April meeting in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have expressed concern about the project because of the 
impact of grading on a large canyon on the eastern edge of the project that 
contains 22 acres of coastal sage shrub and is a prime habitat for the 
black-tailed gnatcatcher, a bird being considered for the U.S. endangered 
species list. 
</P>
<P>
Although the commission agreed to delay a decision on the bulk of the project, 
it gave the green light for the first phase, which will consist of several 
research buildings on a less-sensitive parcel sandwiched between North Torrey 
Pines Road and the existing General Atomics plant. The first phase encompasses 
roughly one-eighth of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The project, being planned by the Chevron Land &amp; Development Co., is 
bounded by Interstate 5 on the east, Genesee Avenue to the south and North 
Torrey Pines Road on the west. The entire proposal calls for 2.5 million square 
feet of office space for as many as 30 firms and between 3,000 and 5,000 
employees.
