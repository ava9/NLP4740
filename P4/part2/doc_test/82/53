</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
USC hasn't beaten Notre Dame in eight years. Stanford did it last week. 
</P>
<P>
That alone should be enough to motivate USC, which has a 14-game unbeaten 
streak against the Cardinal going into today's game at Stanford Stadium, where 
USC has lost only once in the last 34 years -- and not since 1970, when Jim 
Plunkett was a Stanford senior. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford is 2-3 overall and 1-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference, but its record 
belies its abilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal lost to Colorado in its opener, 21-17, when Eric Bieniemy scored 
on a one-yard, fourth-down run with 12 seconds left. It lost to UCLA the next 
week at the Rose Bowl, 32-31, when Brad Daluiso kicked a 21-yard field goal 
with one second to play. 
</P>
<P>
USC (4-1, 1-1) is still expected to extend its winning streak in the 
69-year-old stadium to 11 games, but not without a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"This game means everything to us," USC Coach Larry Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford, a loser against San Jose State two weeks ago, stunned No. 1-ranked 
and previously unbeaten Notre Dame, 36-31, last Saturday at South Bend, Ind., 
ending a 12-game winless streak on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal boasts a variety of offensive weapons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Quarterback Jason Palumbis, his injured right shoulder surgically repaired 
last November, has discovered after sitting on the bench last season that he 
can still throw. He has completed 70.4% of his passes to put him on a pace to 
break Turk Schonert's one-season school record of 67% and to challenge the 
Pac-10 record of 70.7%, set by former California quarterback Rich Campbell in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
Palumbis, who completed 26 of 34 passes for 256 yards against Notre Dame, has 
been even more accurate after halftime, completing 77% of his second-half 
passes, including 15 of 17 against the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like it," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Halfback Glyn Milburn, a transfer from Oklahoma, is a multiple threat and 
ranks fifth in the nation in all-purpose running. 
</P>
<P>
A sophomore who rushed for a state-record 2,718 yards as a senior at Santa 
Monica High three years ago, Milburn is among the Pac-10 leaders in rushing, 
receiving, kickoff-return yardage and punt-return yardage. 
</P>
<P>
"The (most important) addition to their team," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Split end Ed McCaffrey, who has caught 34 passes for 450 yards since 
missing the Cardinal's opener because of back spasms, leads the nation in 
receptions per game and ranks third in the nation in receiving yardage. 
</P>
<P>
A senior from Allentown, Pa., and older brother of Duke basketball player Billy 
McCaffrey, he is on a pace to break the conference one-season records for total 
receptions and receiving yardage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fullback Tommy Vardell, who scored on four one-yard runs against Notre 
Dame, has 11 touchdowns this season, eight from one yard out and none on a run 
of longer than eight yards. 
</P>
<P>
He needs only two more rushing touchdowns to break Brad Muster's single-season 
school record and 11 to tie a conference record shared by former USC tailbacks 
O.J. Simpson and Marcus Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Vardell, who has rushed for only 199 yards, has scored most of his touchdowns 
behind Bob Whitfield, a 6-foot-7, 300-pound sophomore tackle from Banning High 
in Wilmington who was recruited by USC, among many others. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really a dominant player," Cardinal Coach Dennis Green said. 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder Stanford has scored a touchdown or a field goal on 20 of 22 
possessions inside its opponents' 20-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
The red zone, as it's called, has been the Cardinal zone. 
</P>
<P>
On defense, Stanford has not been as efficient. The Cardinal has been 
out-gained in all but one of its games. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Stanford held Notre Dame to seven second-half points in overcoming a 
24-7 deficit last week. 
</P>
<P>
"They've put it all together," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
And at a bad time for USC. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
USC tailback Ricky Ervins, who has not participated in contact drills since 
suffering a sprained left ankle Sept. 29 at Ohio State, did not make the trip. 
He will again be replaced by sophomore Mazio Royster, who ran for 203 yards and 
three touchdowns last Saturday night in a 30-17 victory over Washington State 
at the Coliseum. . . . Backup guard Kian Ramsay did not make the trip because 
of a neck sprain. 
</P>
<P>
USC hasn't lost to Stanford since 1975, when the Cardinal won, 13-10, at the 
Coliseum. In 1979, behind quarterback Turk Schonert, Stanford rallied from a 
21-0 halftime deficit to a 21-21 tie at the Coliseum, giving the Trojans their 
only blemish on an 11-0-1 season. . . . Since 1957, USC is 28-3-1 against 
Stanford. . . . The series dates to 1905. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Todd Marinovich needs two completions to move into third place on 
USC's all-time passing list and 49 to move into second place. . . . USC's Scott 
Lockwood leads the Pacific 10 and ranks fifth in the nation with a punt-return 
average of 20.7 yards. . . . Stanford had been 0-11-1 on the road since 1987, 
before winning last week at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford Coach Dennis Green does not anticipate a letdown by his team after 
last week's emotional victory over Notre Dame. Watching USC on film sobered the 
Cardinal, he said. . . . USC Coach Larry Smith, on tight end Yonnie Jackson, 
who will replace injured Frank Griffin in the starting lineup: "The best thing 
he does is block the sweep. He blocks that as well as or better than Frank."
