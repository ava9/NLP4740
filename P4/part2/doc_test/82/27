The revelation that five Notre Dame football players tested positive for 
steroid use was no revelation at all. In fact, the allegation by former Notre 
Dame lineman Steve Huffman that half of the Irish lettermen took steroids isn't 
even the most serious charge contained in the first-person story he co-authored 
for this week's Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
Steroid use at America's University? The school under the personal watch of 
Touchdown Jesus? Of course. The teenagers who enroll at Notre Dame as freshmen, 
football players or not, are not the little angels propagandists like Lou Holtz 
swear they are. They're normal kids. In the case of football players, they're 
tempted, like players anywhere, to take steroids. Huffman wrote that he knew 
players who were dealing steroids, that players kept up to 50 bottles of pills 
and "injectables" in their rooms. Needles were in the trash cans, he said. If 
that was the case, it doesn't make Notre Dame a terrible place; it means Notre 
Dame is up against the same problems confronting any big-time college football 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"Notre Dame officials will deny all this, of course," Huffman said. And of 
course, he was right. They denied widespread steroid use, and said five players 
since 1987 have tested positive. Let's get something straight; just because 
five players test positive doesn't mean only five payers used the stuff. One 
reason the original NFL steroid policy had no teeth was that players had plenty 
of time to train while using steroids in the offseason, then got off them in 
plenty of time to pass a scheduled drug test. Notre Dame has been one of the 
leaders in conducting random, year-round testing. Still, some players had to be 
sophisticated enough to mask usage or evade detection. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of trying to deny Huffman's story or hush it up, Notre Dame officials 
would do well to check out his allegations further. They also would be 
well-served by being a little more sensitive to Huffman's story than Holtz 
allegedly was to injured players. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, a coach is not responsible for a guy who makes a conscious decision 
to juice up on steroids. But he is responsible for demonstrating some 
compassion when a kid he has recruited and promised to take care of comes into 
his office and says, "Coach, my shoulder is about to fall off." 
</P>
<P>
Huffman writes about an argument his father had with Holtz back when he was 
coach of Arkansas and Huffman's brother Mike was a Razorback. Mike Huffman says 
Holtz would try to throw injured players out of the athletic dorm, lest they 
"demoralize the other players." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Huffman also says Holtz tried to run him out of South Bend and back to 
school in Texas after he was injured at Notre Dame, and that Holtz called him a 
"coward" for not playing through a shoulder injury that had required surgery. 
Huffman's credibility already has been questioned, partly because current 
players have not rushed forward to substantiate his claims and also because he 
was paid (a reported $5,000) to co-author the piece. Still, on this score, 
Huffman's account rings very true, and it's a story that can be told at 
campuses all across America. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz unconscionably called Huffman "a quitter" in his best-selling book, "The 
Fighting Spirit." Huffman, quite appropriately, pointed out that it is Holtz 
with the history of quitting-head coaching jobs at William and Mary, North 
Carolina State, Minnesota (remember the infamous "escape clause") and don't 
forget the New York Jets, where he lasted through only 13 weeks of a 14-week 
NFL season. Holtz escaped from Minnesota just before the NCAA came to campus to 
investigate alleged violations. Now, that's quitting. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman's story wasn't critical of Notre Dame as much as it was critical of 
Holtz, one of the more irritating men in college athletics. Is he a great 
college football coach? Without question. He's rebuilt programs everywhere he's 
been and won a national title. 
</P>
<P>
He's also a world-class whiner. He offended practically anyone with common 
sense, particularly his coaching colleagues, last year by saying over and over 
that his team wasn't any good ("We're not No. 1; we may not even be in the top 
50") despite the fact that Notre Dame was virtually a consensus choice for No. 
1 in the preseason polls. 
</P>
<P>
His teams hardly comported themselves as the gentlemen the school would like us 
all to believe they are. Remember the fights in the tunnel at Notre Dame 
stadium against Miami and Southern Cal. Only after three ugly incidents -- 
there also was unsportsmanlike taunting -- did Holtz accept responsibility for 
his team's behavior and publicly insist he would resign if it happened again. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame is not under indictment here; many schools would be wise to use its 
overall student-athlete philosophy as a model. But if school officials really 
believe there were only five players who took steroids the last three seasons; 
if school officials believe Huffman simply lied to Sports Illustrated about 
Holtz's insensitivity for a fee, then Notre Dame will continue to have a very 
serious problem.
