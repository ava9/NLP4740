GERRY FAUST FINDS SERENITY AT AKRON; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FIVE YEARS AFTER HIS DISAPPOINTING TENURE AT NOTRE DAME, THE 
COACH DISCOVERS THAT THE CROWDS ARE SMALLER, BUT THE REWARDS ARE GREATER, WITH 
THE DIVISION I-A ZIPS.

At Moeller High School in Cincinnati, Coach Gerry Faust and his players drew 
thousands of people to home games to watch the nation's most dominant prep 
football team play. Later, when Faust was at Notre Dame, a stadium crowd of at 
least 59,000 was guaranteed -- regardless of the opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays Faust is lucky if he can get one-third of the seats filled at the 
Rubber Bowl, home to his University of Akron Zips. Although Faust probably 
couldn't fill the stadium's 35,000 seats if he gave tickets away, he finally is 
finding serenity as a college football coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a great group of kids with a super attitude," said Faust, who takes his 
Zips (3-2-1) to Annapolis, Md., on Saturday to face the Naval Academy (2-3). 
"I'm really enjoying myself now." 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere surrounding Faust, in his fifth year at Akron, has not always 
been pleasant. When he left Moeller after the 1980 season to coach Notre Dame, 
Faust was supposed to carry the winning tradition to South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time he resigned after five years, Faust had the most losses of any 
football coach in school history, with a 30-26-1 record. After the Irish lost, 
58-7, to Miami in his last game there, a Sports Illustrated article described 
Faust as the man who left "Notre Dame's football program . . . in shambles." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't like to read or hear the things you hear about the coaching, but you 
have to learn to accept that," Faust said of the media attacks. "I wanted to 
win. Not because people were upset. I wanted to do it because I believed in the 
university and what it stood for." 
</P>
<P>
What Notre Dame followers could not accept were the two 5-6 seasons under 
Faust. In that time Notre Dame lost four straight times to Air Force -- its 
only losses to a service academy since dropping a game to Navy in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his lack of success at Notre Dame, Faust received nine job offers after 
he left. He settled on Akron, a Division I-AA school that was looking for a 
well-known coach to engineer its transition to Division I-A. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked forward to the challenge," he said. "After taking the job at Notre 
Dame, I realized I had a lot to learn. Looking back, I wasn't ready. I know how 
to deal with college kids now. Ten years ago, I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
The Zips -- Zippy the kangaroo is the mascot -- are 25-23-2 under Faust. Last 
year, in just its third year of I-A ball, Akron had a 6-4-1 record after two 
losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing better than we thought we would be doing. We have a long way to 
go, but we're pleased with the progress we've made," Faust said. "We eventually 
would like to get to the level of the Naval Academy, Syracuse, West Point and 
Boston College. The transition to I-A has been really tough." 
</P>
<P>
After coaching at an institution that pretty much sold itself, Faust has had to 
become a salesman to attract players. 
</P>
<P>
"We made great strides over the last couple of years, and the enthusiasm is a 
lot better in the community," he said. "You have to really work hard to get 
kids here, and I'm always out recruiting. But the work is paying off. Our kids 
have a great belief in each other."
