SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace areas at Quad-City Airport, Moline, IL, Capital Airport, Springfield,
IL, Kent County International Airport, Grand Rapids, MI, and Michiana Regional Transportation Center Airport,
South Bend, IN. Presently, these areas are designated as Class C airspace when the associated control towers are in
operation. However, controlled airspace to the surface is needed when the control towers located at these airports
are closed. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument flight rule
(IFR) operations when these control towers are closed.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Moline, IL, Springfield, IL, Grand Rapids, MI, and South Bend, IN. Currently these airspace areas are
designated as Class C when the associated control towers are in operation. Nevertheless, controlled airspace to
the surface is needed for IFR operations at Quad-City Airport, Moline, IL, Capital Airport, Springfield, IL, Kent
County International Airport, Grand Rapids, MI, and Michiana Regional Transportation Center Airport, South Bend,
IN, when the control towers are closed. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace
for IFR operations at these airports when these control towers are closed.
