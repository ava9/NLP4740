  [Text] A document from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent 
to our news desk 6 April states that Mozambique and Lithuania 
have decided to establish diplomatic relations at ambassadorial 
level as of 30 March. 
  The document says the decision was made due to the two 
countries desire to develop relations of friendship and 
cooperation in the political, trade and economic fields, based 
on the 18 April 1961 Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations. 
  Relations between the two countries will be based on 
principles of sovereign equality, mutual respect, self 
determination, independence, territorial integrity, 
noninterference in the internal affairs of each country, as 
provided for in the UN Charter. 
  The document from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also says 
that the two countries are convinced that establishing 
diplomatic relations between them corresponds to the interests 
of both states and will strengthen peace and international 
security. 
  The agreement formalizing this decision was signed by Pedro 
Comissario, Mozambican ambassador extraordinary and 
plenipotentiary to the United Nations, and Ambassador Anicetas 
Simutis, Lithuania's permanent representative in the United 
Nations.
