<P>
The Soviet Union obliterated two of the remaining remnants of the diplomatic 
divisions of the Cold War on Sunday by establishing full diplomatic relations 
with South Korea and restoring consular ties with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze hammered out the details of the 
agreements in back-to-back meetings with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy 
and South Korean Foreign Minister Choi Ho Joong in the offices of the U.N. 
Security Council president. 
</P>
<P>
By upgrading its relations with two staunch American allies, the Soviet Union 
stole a march on the United States, which Saturday held its first high-level 
talks with Moscow's ally, Vietnam, in more than 15 years but stopped far short 
of establishing diplomatic ties. 
</P>
<P>
"As of today, full diplomatic relations are in place between the Republic of 
Korea and the Soviet Union," Shevardnadze told reporters with Choi at his side. 
"I think it is a normal, logical process." 
</P>
<P>
A joint communique said that Moscow and Seoul would exchange ambassadors next 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"The two sides are convinced that this step will contribute to enhancing 
stability and to a peaceful settlement on the Korean Peninsula," the communique 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said that in addition to establishing consular relations with 
Israel, he and Levy agreed to meet regularly, perhaps clearing the way to 
establishment of full diplomatic relations later. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Korean Peninsula was divided in 1945 into Communist-ruled North 
Korea and anti-Communist South Korea, the Soviet Union has maintained friendly 
ties only with the regime in the North. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said that Moscow's decision to establish relations with Seoul 
would not change the Soviet relationship with the North Korean government in 
Pyongyang. Choi added, "We hope that the Soviet Union will continue to have 
good relations with North Korea." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the action is a dramatic setback to North Korea's Stalinist-style 
government and its aging leader, Kim Il Sung. It leaves China as North Korea's 
only remaining patron. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that establishing diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and 
South Korea will aid the cause of stability in Asia and the Pacific region," 
Shevardnadze said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union and Israel broke diplomatic relations during the Arab-Israeli 
war of 1967 when Moscow sided with the Arabs. Paradoxically, the Soviet-Israeli 
chill lasted for more than a decade after Egypt, which fielded the largest Arab 
army in the war, established diplomatic relations with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Contacts between the Soviet Union and Israel began to ease in 1987, when the 
Soviets posted a delegation in Tel Aviv that operated through the Finnish 
Embassy. A year later, Israel established a low-level mission in Moscow under 
the auspices of the Netherlands Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
"This means we will no longer need the offices of the Netherlands Embassy in 
Moscow," said Yuval Rotem, a spokesman for Israel's U.N. mission. "Now, we will 
be able to grant visas to immigrants on our own." 
</P>
<P>
Rotem said that Ariel Levine, head of the present Israeli mission in Moscow, 
would probably be named consul general. 
</P>
<P>
The action chips away at the bipolar world of the Cold War in which the United 
States and the Soviet Union led rival and antagonistic camps. Moscow's decision 
to establish relations with South Korea came just three days after North Korea 
proposed opening talks with Japan in November to establish diplomatic ties. 
</P>
<P>
North Korea, aided by Chinese troops, fought a bitter war with South Korea and 
its allies, including the United States, from 1950 to 1953. The dividing line 
between the two Koreas remains one of the tensest borders in the world, now 
that the Berlin Wall has fallen and East-West hostility in Europe is virtually 
at an end. 
</P>
<P>
The United States maintains more than 43,000 troops in Korea 37 years after the 
war ended in an uneasy truce. 
</P>
<P>
Choi said he hopes that both South Korea and North Korea will soon be admitted 
to the United Nations. The rival regimes now have only observer status at the 
world forum. 
</P>
<P>
"I very much stressed that on the principle of universality, Korea should have 
its rightful place in the United Nations," Choi told a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
North Korea has opposed membership for both states on the grounds that such a 
solution would perpetuate the division of the peninsula. Pyongyang has 
suggested sharing a single seat until the two Koreas are able to unify. 
</P>
<P>
Choi said Shevardnadze agreed that the question of U.N. membership should be 
discussed between the two Korean states. But he added, "If we cannot find 
common ground, we will have to make our own decision." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Seoul would agree to share the seat, he snapped: "No, no. Impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Choi said that the prime ministers of the two Koreas will meet in Pyongyang on 
Oct. 16. The talks would be a follow-up to a meeting between the prime 
ministers in Seoul earlier this month which marked the highest-level political 
contact since the peninsula was divided at the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"We will try to change the North Korean position," Choi said. "We have a good 
example with Germany and Yemen before us." Divided Yemen and Germany both have 
recently unified or agreed to do so, even though their once antagonistic halves 
each had enjoyed full U.N. membership. 
</P>
<P>
Choi said he and Shevardnadze agreed that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
and South Korean President Roh Tae Woo would exchange visits soon, although no 
date has been set.
