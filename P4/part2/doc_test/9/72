<P>
To Chung Ju Yung, founder of the massive Hyundai group, the Soviet Union's 
recent diplomatic recognition of South Korea was a simple matter. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed each other economically," he said in an interview. "If there is an 
economic need, politics will follow." 
</P>
<P>
Chung, 74, South Korean business's self-appointed ambassador to the Soviet 
Union, did more than any other executive to persuade Moscow to establish ties 
with Seoul, archenemy of Moscow ally North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is pioneering a new form of economic cooperation: trilateral projects 
involving China, the Soviet Union and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he suggested, such projects could include North Korea as well. 
</P>
<P>
Hyundai has put up $30 million to start a joint Soviet-South Korean forestry 
operation at Svetlaya, north of Vladivostok, that will employ 500 Chinese and 
500 Chinese of Korean ancestry by next spring, he said. Three hundred of the 
workers from China are already on the job, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Exports of timber to South Korea, which are expected to amount to around $100 
million a year when the project is fully developed, will start as early as next 
January, he said. 
</P>
<P>
How multinational cooperation in Northeast Asian development progresses, Chung 
said, "will largely depend on how China's policy changes." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how many (multinational) projects will emerge, but there 
certainly will be some projects forthcoming," he predicted. "Eventually, North 
Korea will join." 
</P>
<P>
On his first trip to Beijing last month to attend the Asian Games, Chung said, 
he found "Chinese authorities very enthusiastic about sending their workers" to 
such projects as the Svetlaya forestry undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that Chinese authorities had urged Hyundai to join in the 
bidding for offshore oil and gas drilling in Pohai Bay, the first such offer 
reported to have been made to a South Korean businessman. Chung told the 
Chinese that he would consider the offer. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, Chinese officials were reluctant to meet (South) Korean officials and 
businessmen," he said. "But this time we had no trouble meeting Chinese 
officials in charge of economic affairs." 
</P>
<P>
He said he met both China's construction minister and the president of the 
state corporation in charge of petroleum development. 
</P>
<P>
Chung indicated that he was not interested in Japanese participation in 
multinational Northeast Asian projects, an idea that has gained some support 
among Japanese businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese have their own vested interests in China and are focusing on 
commodity sales to the Soviet Union," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chung is now "honorary chairman" of the $32-billion Hyundai empire of firms 
that manufacture everything from automobiles and ships to semiconductors and 
has made an international imprint in the construction business. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, South Korea's prime minister, Kang Young Hoon, made the first-ever 
trip by a head of the South Korean Cabinet to North Korea's capital of 
Pyongyang for talks with his Communist counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
The visit, made to reciprocate North Korean Prime Minister Yon Hyong Muk's 
September trip to Seoul, came in the wake of Pyongyang's decision to seek 
diplomatic ties with Japan and the announcement of the Seoul-Moscow diplomatic 
ties. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Chung said, he sees little prospect of change in North Korea in the next 
year. "Change in North Korea will probably be more gradual," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he made it clear that promoting change in North Korea, where he was born, 
has been the prime goal of his six trips to the Soviet Union and the nine 
development projects he has promised to consider with the nation that has been 
North Korea's chief supplier of weapons since before the 1950-53 Korean war. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always been interested in normalization of North-South Korea 
relations," he said. "I thought the Soviet Union could be a significant factor 
in making that happen (and that) it would be the key to making South Korea be 
not in conflict with the North." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, a reunified Korea "would be a self-sufficient economy," he said. 
"We would no longer need exports to grow." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years or so after reunification, a single Korea would be a giant on the 
world scene, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
If the North and South were reunified within two or three years, "the 
per-capita gross national product would be very comparable to Japan's" by the 
year 2010, he said. That would translate into a GNP half the size of Japan's by 
2010. 
</P>
<P>
North and South Korea have a combined population of about 60 million, compared 
to Japan's 120 million. 
</P>
<P>
Chung said he will make his seventh trip to the Soviet Union next month in an 
attempt to firm up a list of eight other possible joint ventures that Hyundai 
is considering. Among them are ship repair facilities, coal mining and natural 
gas development and a factory to build personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
He said he expects about half the targeted projects to come to fruition after 
feasibility studies are conducted. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of the investment that the South Korean conglomerate would make, the 
projects would range in value from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of 
dollars, he said.
