Chang-hun, on 3 February -- place not given] 
  [Text] [Yi Chang-hun] Reacting to a rumor about the 
deployment of U.S. Patriot missiles to the ROK, North Korea 
threatened that it will cancel the withholding of its withdrawal 
from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. As a result, 
the situation on the Korean peninsula is becoming alarming. Do 
you think that the U.S.-North Korea talks and talks between the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea will 
be successful? 
  [Panov] Russia does not think that U.S.-North Korea talks 
and IAEA-North Korea talks have been ruptured. Russia's 
position is that the talks should continue. The North Korean 
nuclear issue should be resolved under the IAEA's control for 
peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. There were some 
successes, although limited, in U.S.-North Korea talks in the 
past. However, the talks were recently suspended and many 
difficult problems are laid on the road toward a third round of 
talks. 
  Russia is discussing the North Korean nuclear problem with 
the United States and China, not to mention the ROK, and there 
are no remarkable differences in the positions of each nation. 
  These nations share the view that North Korea should settle 
nuclear negotiation with the IAEA at an early date and should 
accept the nuclear inspection. 
  [Yi] What is your view on the possibility and prospects for 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula as discussed during 
U.S.-Russia summit and talks between Russian and Chinese foreign 
ministers? 
  [Panov] The only way toward the resolution of 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula at present is to bring 
about concrete fruition in U.S.-North Korea talks and in 
IAEA-North Korea talks. Although talks are very difficult and 
may face a stumbling block, it is important to continue the 
talks in a manner of dialogue. 
  [Yi] What is your opinion on the multilateral security 
cooperation system proposed by the ROK for peace and stability 
on the Korean peninsula? 
  [Panov] Russia basically supports this. This plan is a 
method enabling one to resolve various problems pertaining to 
security on the Korean peninsula, including the North Korean 
nuclear issue. The relevant countries are making efforts to 
achieve this plan. 
  The ROK established diplomatic relations with Russia and 
China. What is left as a pending issue is North Korea's 
normalization of relations with the United States and Japan. If 
the North Korean nuclear problem is solved and normalization of 
relations is achieved, an important progress will be registered 
in efforts to promote security on the Korean peninsula and in 
the Northeast Asia. 
  [Yi] Do you think the Kim Il-song-Kim Chong-il hereditary 
system will proceed smoothly in North Korea? 
  [Panov] I debated on this issue with relevant American and 
ROK figures when I served as Russian Ambassador in Seoul. We 
have drawn a conclusion that it is difficult to predict how the 
North Korean society will change in the future. Since North 
Korea is an extremely closed society and flow of information is 
restricted, analysis and assessment of the practical situation 
on the progress of the hereditary system are very difficult. 
However, international society shares the view that 
stabilization in North Korea's political situation is important. 
  [Yi] When do you think President Kim Yong-sam will visit 
Russia and what are the important agendas? 
  [Panov] Russia is hoping that President Kim will visit 
within this year, and is preparing for this. We believe that 
with President Kim's visit as an occasion, the two nations will 
solve the pending issues including Russia's debt to the ROK, and 
will further promote cooperation in various domains of relations 
between the two countries including domains of politics, 
economy, and culture. 
  [Yi] What is your opinion on the possibility of expanding 
economic cooperation between the two countries and on proper 
means for a solution to Russia's debt to the ROK? 
  [Panov] The amount of trade between the two countries last 
year was $1.5 billion--a 40 percent increase from the previous 
year--and the amount is expected to increase further. We are 
well aware that because of uneasiness in the political situation 
in Russia, ROK businessmen from small and medium-size 
enterprises are reluctant to advance to Russia. However, Russia 
will be stabilized in the future. For example in cooperative 
relations between Russia and the ROK, a ROK firm advanced to 
Russia's Far Eastern district through the introduction of the 
Russian Embassy in the ROK, and established a joint-venture 
textile plant there. This firm has earned a great amount of 
interest by exporting its products to the United States. ROK 
businessmen, who wish to advance to Russia, may inquire of 
Russian Embassy in Seoul about method and procedure of advance. 
Since reshuffle of Russian cabinet members was carried out 
recently, I cannot tell you precisely at this moment about the 
method as to how the Russian Government will resolve the issue 
of its debt to the ROK and of its interest payment. At present, 
relevant officials within the Russian Government are exchanging 
their views on measures for solving the problem.
