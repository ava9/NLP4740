  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 (YONHAP) -- North Korea participated 
in an Association of Southeast Asian Nations-United Nations 
workshop held in Bangkok on Thursday, KYODO News Service 
reported Friday. KYODO quoted a diplomatic source in Bangkok as 
saying that the North Korean ambassador to Thailand took part in 
the workshop as an observer, the first time that Pyongyang has 
participated in an ASEAN-related meeting. At the workshop, 19 
countries discussed cooperating with one another in the 
diplomacy of peace and prevention of disputes. 
  North Korea has contacted the Thai and other ASEAN member 
governments about joining their group, and its participation in 
the workshop may be related to the move, according to KYODO. 
  Thailand was notified last week of North Korea's desire to 
participate in the ASEAN-UN workshop, and allowed Pyongyang to 
take part as an observer after consulting with other nations, 
KYODO said. 
  The United States, Japan, Vietnam and China also attended 
the 
meeting in addition to the six ASEAN members, but South Korea 
did not take part, KYODO said. 
  Meanwhile, a South Korean Foreign Ministry official in Seoul 
said that the Thai Government had invited South Korea as an 
observer. But he said he did not understand why Thailand had 
not invited South Korea, an ASEAN dialogue partner, as a formal 
attendant.
