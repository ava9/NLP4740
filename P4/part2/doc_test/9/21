<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Ambassador to the ROK Georgiy </F>
Kunadze by KBS anchorman Yi Yun-song; Kunadze answers in Russia 
with Korean subtitles -- place not given; recorded] 
  [Text] [Yi Yun-song] How are you? 
  [Ambassador Kunadze] How are you? 
  [Yi] I believe ROK President Kim Yong-sam's upcoming visit 
to Russia will serve as an opportunity to further deepen and 
develop ROK-Russia relations which have been promoted for the 
past four years since diplomatic relations were established. 
What does Russia expect from President Kim Yong-sam's visit to 
Russia? 
  [Kunadze] First of all, President Kim Yong-sam is like an 
old friend, and, therefore, the warmest hospitality will be 
extended to him during his visit to Russia. 
  [Yi] The Russian Government has proposed eight-party talks 
to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. The eight parties 
are North and South Korea, the United Nations, the United 
States, China, Japan, Russia, and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency. What does Russia think are the prospects for 
resolving the North Korean nuclear issue? And, what efforts is 
Russia making to hold the eight-party talks? 
  [Kunadze] The situation surrounding the North Korean nuclear 
issue is serious, and various methods have been sought to 
resolve this issue. Russia is optimistic about this issue. 
Therefore, Russia has proposed eight-party talks to discuss 
stability on the Korean peninsula. Still, this does not mean we 
intend to replace the on-going bilateral [as heard] talks with 
the eight-party talks. 
  [Yi] Five North Korean loggers arrived in the ROK on 18 May. 
This is a testament to how much relations between the ROK and 
Russia have developed. It has been learned that approximately 
90 other loggers hope to defect to the ROK. Will there be 
difficulties in their defection to the ROK? 
  [Kunadze] We do not know the exact number of loggers who 
want to defect to the ROK. However, it is clear what Russia 
attaches the greatest importance to in resolving this issue is 
whether each logger hopes to defect to the ROK. 
  [Yi] The ROK and Russia have failed to reach agreement on 
how Russia will repay the principal and interest of the $1.53 
million which was loaned to Russia as part of the $3 million 
loan which the ROK promised when the two countries established 
diplomatic relations. The ROK demands a repayment with goods, 
separately from the agreement of the Paris Club, a meeting of 
creditors. It has been learned, however, that Russia hopes to 
repay with weapons. Would you tell us Russia's position on this 
issue? 
  [Kunadze] Our position is simple: We are ready to repay the 
loan to the ROK. We hope to find appropriate ways to do so. 
However, I think that the fact that we cannot violate the 
resolution of the Paris Club must be put into consideration.
