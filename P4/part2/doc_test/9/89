  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 17 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam on 
Monday [17 January] afternoon met visiting Spanish Foreign 
Minister Javier Solana at Chongwadae [presidential office]. 
  During the meeting, President Kim conferred the Order of 
Diplomatic Service Merit, Kwanghwa Medal, on the Spanish 
minister before exchanging opinions on ways to further promote 
bilateral cooperation. 
  The president especially thanked Minister Solana for the 
support his country, as a non-permanent member country of the 
U.N. Security Council, extended to South Korea over the North 
Korean nuclear issues. 
  Meanwhile, at a press conference Minister Solana said the 
North Korean nuclear issues should be resolved in a rightful 
direction in the interests of world security. 
  Solana said it is desirable that the nuclear question will 
be 
settled before the need arises for the U.N. Security Council to 
take a sanction. 
  Also saying that there is a growing need of cooperation 
between Korea and Spain in the areas of international politics 
and economy, Minister Solana expressed the hope that his visit 
would contribute much to expanding friendly cooperative ties 
between the two countries. 
  The Spanish minister flew into Seoul on Sunday [16 January] 
for a three-day official visit. He was the first Spanish 
foreign minister ever to visit Seoul since the two countries 
entered ambassadorial relations in 1950.
