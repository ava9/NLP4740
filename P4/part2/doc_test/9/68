  [Text] Rawalpindi (PPI) -- North Korea supports Pakistan's 
peaceful nuclear programme, said the North Korean Ambassador to 
Pakistan Mr Choe Su-il. 
  He was informally talking to the PPI after a function held 
in 
connection with annual prize distribution ceremony of Little 
Angels School, which co-incided with the 17th foundation day of 
the institution. 
  He said the perceptions of Pakistan and Korea on the nuclear 
issue were identical as Pakistan had an expressed desire for a 
nuclear free South Asia, while Korea wanted nuclear free Korean 
peninsula. 
  Asked would it be justified to pressurize Pakistan on 
unilaterally signing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) 
he said "it is upto the Government of Pakistan to make a 
decision in this regard". 
  The Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Korea (DPRK) 
earlier in his address said Pakistan and Korea enjoyed excellent 
traditional relations adding that the ties of friendship had 
further been cemented by the visit of Pakistan's delegation 
headed by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to Korea. "We highly 
value the friendship with Pakistan and will do our best too 
further promote the ties", Choe Su-il maintained. 
  Underlining the importance of education he said it played 
key 
role for the nations to achieve the target of progress and 
prosperity. 
  The Principal of the school Mrs Salma Siddiqui presented a 
momento from all the `angels' and staff of the school to the 
chief guest. 
  The DPRK Ambassador presented a traditional Korean painting 
to Mrs Siddiqui and donated some books for the school library. 
  Students of the school, wearing colourful dresses, presented 
interesting tableaus and sung amusing songs on the occasion. 
They also presented plays to entertain the participants of the 
function. The chief guest distributed prizes among the students 
who showed remarkable performance in curricular and 
co-curricular activities during the year.
