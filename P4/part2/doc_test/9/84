  [Text] Moscow, April 29, RIA -- "Russia's new policy is 
based on the premise that finding new friends does not mean 
losing old chums," Ivan Rybkin, who chairs the State Duma, told 
North Korean Ambassador Son Sung-pil on April 29. The meeting 
was held at the request of the latter. 
  The ambassador spoke in favour of more dynamically 
developing 
bilateral ties to note that "certain differences in our 
countries' respective ideologies are no reason for deteriorating 
mutual relations." On the so-called nuclear issue, the 
ambassador of North Korea said that his country is ready and 
willing to deal with all controversial issues of normalisation 
in the Korean Peninsula by way of negotiation. 
  The two sides discussed prospects for bilateral cooperation, 
in particular in the economy, science and technology.
