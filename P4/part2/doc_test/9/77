  [Text] The Korean Peninsula is the only hot spot in Asia 
and the Pacific which may seriously destabilize the situation in 
and outside this region. Given this, talks with the South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam in Moscow on June 1 to 4 will deal 
with ways of easing tensions in the Korean Peninsula and with 
South Korean-Russian relations, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister 
Aleksandr Panov told INTERFAX on Tuesday. 
  He believes that the South Korean president's visit to 
Moscow 
provides "one more proof of our stable and broadening 
relations." "We hope that the forthcoming visit will give a 
fresh impetus to them," he said. 
  To quote Panov, relations between Moscow and Seoul develop 
normally and have no unsurmountable barriers, which can be 
judged from a 40 percent increase in bilateral trade last year. 
  Panov emphasized that Russia's initiative on the convocation 
of an international conference on the Korean Peninsula remained 
in force. "This idea has not been rejected by anyone, although 
most of our partners give preference to bilateral talks," he 
said. 
  He told INTERFAX that Russia had already held consultations 
with China, Japan and other parties concerned. "No one has 
removed this idea from the agenda. Moreover, everyone thinks 
that at a certain stage it may become rather efficient. We 
don't think that bilateral talks, the way they have been 
conducted until now, hold any promise. They are not making any 
progress and only complicate the situation each time they find 
themselves in a deadlock," said Panov. 
  He announced that Russia would like the People's Democratic 
Republic of Korea to adhere to the treaty on the 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. On the other hand, we 
think that it is high time that all the parties concerned worked 
out a single policy instead of holding consultations on the 
Korean problem, he continued. A balance of interests must be 
found, whereby the security interests of both Korean states will 
be observed, said Panov. 
  It is difficult so far to talk about the date of the 
international conference, he went on to say. "We propose that a 
consultative meeting be held to discuss the agenda," he said. 
  Asked if the government crisis in Japan would influence 
Russian-Japanese relations, Panov said that Russia had no fears 
on this score. Judging by all accounts, Tokyo will not change 
its policy in relation to Russia whoever heads the Japanese 
government and whichever parties are represented in it.
