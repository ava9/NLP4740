  [Text] Beijing, Feb. 22 (YONHAP) -- North Korean 
ambassador to China Chu Chang-chun returned to Pyongyang in 
mid-February to consult with the Foreign Ministry on the nuclear 
problem, a diplomatic source here said Tuesday. 
  The source said that Chu went back to his country ostensibly 
to attend celebrations for the 52nd birthday of Kim Chong-il, 
son and heir-apparent of President Kim Il-song, on Feb. 16. But 
in fact, Chu was recalled by his home government to discuss 
problems related to the nuclear issue and the planned visit to 
China by South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, the source said, 
asking for anonymity. 
  "Judging by past experience, Chu will hold a press 
conference 
as soon as he returns to Beijing and discuss North Korea's 
position on pending issues," the source said. 
  If the ambassador does so, part of North Korea's nuclear 
strategy may be revealed, he added. 
  During Chu's absence, Pae Yong-chae, a councilor for 
political affairs at the North Korean embassy, attended a 
commemorative event for the 35th annniversary of the North 
Korea-China Cultural Cooperation Treaty held in Beijing Tuesday.
