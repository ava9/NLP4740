  [Text] The Embassy of the Kingdom of Cambodia in the 
Kingdom of Thailand will open for business this June. This will 
be the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two 
countries after the embassy had been closed for more than two 
decades because of endless civil war. However, sources at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the 
Kingdom of Cambodia have not specified the date the embassy will 
officially be opened. 
  Eng Roland -- an official of FUNCINPEC [National United 
Front 
for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] 
and former minister of tourism in the provisional national 
government of Cambodia, and who has been appointed ambassador 
extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the Kingdom of Thailand -- 
has expressed his determination to improve the relations between 
the two neighboring countries, and in particular to avoid mutual 
misunderstanding. Roland also optimistically hopes that 
relations between the two countries will improve once the 
Cambodian Embassy is opened. 
  This first Cambodian diplomat did not elaborate on what he 
called mutual misunderstanding. However, his statement was 
thought to have referred to the war of words between the 
Cambodian and Thai Governments at the end of April and early May 
because of the Khmer Rouge issue. 
  It may be remembered that the Khmer Rouge problem caused a 
fairly strong verbal exchange between government leaders and 
foreign ministers of Cambodia and Thailand. The Cambodian 
Government believed and had proof to show that Thailand did 
indeed support the Khmer Rouge in attacks against government 
troops in western Cambodia. As for Thailand, it affirmed that 
it had never provided assistance as accused by the Cambodian 
Government. Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister, used strong 
words, even saying that the matter will be taken up with the UN 
Security Council. Howver, the troubled atmosphere between 
Cambodia and Thailand became relaxed through a diplomatic 
settlement. 
  Eng Roland did not discuss how he will start his work with 
Thailand. However, it is understood that diplomacy with 
Thailand is very important to put pressure on the Khmer Rouge at 
a time when the government wants to have something clear from 
Thailand. 
  It is worth noting that the Cambodian Embassy in Thailand 
has 
suffered only slightly and repairs have already been made. The 
embassy is located on Ratdamri Road in Bangkok.
