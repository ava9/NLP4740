  [Text] Tokyo, May 7 (YONHAP) -- Kim Pyong-il, North Korean 
ambassador to Finland and half brother of Kim Chong-il, recently 
returned home, giving rise to speculation that something may 
have happened in Pyongyang, the SANKEI SHIMBUN reported in a 
report from Moscow Saturday. 
  Pyong-il, the son of Kim Il-song and his present wife, Kim 
Song- ae, arrived in Helsinki in early March as Pyongyang's new 
ambassador to Finland and presented his credentials to the 
Finnish president on March 18. 
  The SANKEI report said the junior Kim was just about to 
settle in at a newly purchased mansion when he abruptly flew 
back to Pyongyang on April 22. He has yet to return and take up 
his duties. 
  "His return home was in such a hurry that he didn't even 
bother to go through the required protocol of notifying the 
Finnish Foreign Ministry of his absence," the paper said. 
  Moreover, it said, his departure came several days before 
the 
Finnish president's annual reception for members of the 
diplomatic corps, an occasion which an ambassador, especially a 
new one, shouldn't have missed. 
  As Kim Pyong-il's absence drags on, Finnish papers have 
speculated on the reason for his return to Pyongyang, according 
to SANKEI. 
  One paper said Ambassador Kim's "secret-shrouded" return to 
Pyongyang might have been the result of a political conspiracy 
involving top North Korean leaders. 
  Another daily claimed Kim has been unable to resume his 
duties in Helsinki because of some unusual contingency in North 
Korea. 
  A source in the Finnish Foreign Ministry reportedly said he 
didn't know when Kim would come back to Helsinki. "We don't know 
if Ambassador Kim can return here at all," the source was quoted 
as saying. 
  The North Korean Embassy in Helsinki, fueling the 
speculation, is refusing to comment on the ambassador's abrupt 
return to Pyongyang, the SANKEI report said. 
  Some reports indicated that Pyong-il has been on bad terms 
with his half brother Chong-il, who is likely to succeed his 
aging father as North Korea's leader.
