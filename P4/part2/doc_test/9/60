  [Text] New York, April 1 KYODO -- North Korea's ambassador 
to the United Nations on Friday [1 April] renewed Pyongyang's 
call for high-level talks with the United States to settle a row 
over international inspections on North Korean nuclear 
facilities. 
  In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, Pak Kil-yon said 
North Korea is not opposed to holding high-level talks with the 
U.S. if a ground for such talks is provided. 
  Pak said, "not at this moment, but if the U.S. could lay the 
foundation for a third round of high-level talks, we have stated 
we will not oppose" such a move. 
  On a UN Security Council statement Thursday calling for the 
North to fulfill obligations to open its nuclear facilities to 
international inspections, the ambassador said it is "a 
unilateral demand and (North Korea) does not have an obligation 
to meet it." 
  In a statement issued Thursday, the Security Council urged 
North Korea to allow unrestricted inspections of its nuclear 
facilities and hinted at economic sanctions if it failed to 
comply. 
  But Pak did not deny a possibility of accepting further 
inspections by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), if negotiations with the U.S. proceed. 
  "We have not yet heard of an official proposal from the UN," 
he said. 
  Asked what he has in mind as a condition for holding the 
high- level talks with the U.S., Pak said "it is only the 
fulfillment of the U.S.-DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea) agreement reached on February 25." 
  In the agreement with the north on February 25, the U.S. 
announced it would call off the Team Spirit joint military 
exercises with South Korea in exchange for North Korea's 
acceptance of IAEA inspections on its seven declared nuclear 
plants. 
  The IAEA started the inspections last month but after an 
IAEA 
inspection team was barred from collecting samples of nuclear 
material from one of the seven nuclear plants, the U.S. 
stiffened its attitude. 
  The U.S. and South Korea then reversed the decision to call 
off the Team Spirit war games after the IAEA's announcement that 
Pyongyang had thwarted its nuclear inspections. 
  The Security Council announced it would wait until the end 
of 
April, when the IAEA provides its report on the North Korean 
issue, before it decides if it will actually impose sanctions on 
the north. 
  Diplomatic sources said the focus now has shifted to whether 
the U.S. and the north will resume unofficial contacts to pave 
the way for high-level talks as well as China's efforts to 
persuade Pyongyang to accept the U.N. request. 
  China, as a permanent Security Council member, has veto 
powers on UN resolutions and has maintained close relations with 
North Korea even after the collapse of the former Soviet Union, 
once another supporter of Pyongyang.
