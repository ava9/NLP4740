Memorial: Dozens of people marked the 26th anniversary of President Kennedy's 
assassination Wednesday by visiting Dealey Plaza. By mid-morning 70 tourists 
and Dallas residents had visited. "I think it's an event that needs to be 
remembered but not dwelt upon," said Ron Thompson, 34, a lifelong Dallas 
resident.

Good reading: President Bush won't have any trouble finding a good book to read 
this winter. Esquire magazine shipped the White House 34 volumes picked for the 
President by the 1989 Esquire Register honorees. Oprah Winfrey chose the Bible, 
film maker Spike Lee selected "The Autobiography of Malcolm X." Actor Billy 
Crystal picked Erich Segal's "Love Story" partly because ". . . it's short; he 
can get right back to business." W. Keith Hefner, founder of the Youth 
Communication-New York Center, recommended "The Elements of Style" by William 
Strunk Jr. and E.B. White. "I'd like him to correct his broken syntax," Hefner 
said.

Koch shot: New York's lame-duck Mayor Edward I. Koch claims the Grand Hyatt 
Hotel, partly owned by billionaire Donald Trump, owes the city $2.8 million 
under a lease agreement. The Grand Hyatt called the claim a "blatantly 
political attack" and "one last cheap shot."

Tres chic: When promotion writers at Chicago's Marshall Field &amp; Co. 
discussed whether to use the grammatically correct Le Beau Noel or the 
incorrect but catchy La Belle Noel on the cover of their Christmas catalogue, 
catchy won. "It rhymes," said Field's spokeswoman Kassie Davis. "It was a 
promotion. . . . We thought it would be a little more catchy if it had a 
jingle."
