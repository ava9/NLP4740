  [Text] Jaime Abad, director of the Judicial Technical 
Police (PTJ), said yesterday that the institution he heads is 
legally and constitutionally empowered to seize weapons from 
U.S. citizens outside of their working hours. 
  "Regardless of whether (the weapon) is a high-caliber 
weapon, 
civilians are prohibited from having high-caliber weapons in 
residences," the official said. 
  Oswaldo Fernandez, director of the National Police, charged 
on 12 January it is "illegal" for U.S. soldiers or any citizen 
to have high-caliber weapons in their homes. 
  The PTJ director expressed concern in the wake of the 
killing 
and suicide that took place at the Campo Lindbergh housing area 
on 8 January where a U.S. soldier shot and killed his wife with 
a rifle and later committed suicide by shooting himself in the 
head. 
  Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino said that if he gets a 
formal request from the police director, he will speak with 
Ambassador Deane Hinton to request that the Southern Command 
issue regulations to its troops on the possession of weapons. 
  The PTJ chief explained that once a weapon is seized and an 
individual is detained, he is then subject to proceedings 
according to the Canal Treaties. The liaison agents are then 
contacted. 
  Quincleiton Mora, division chief of the Arms Permit Division 
of the PTJ, said it is completely illegal for U.S. military 
personnel based in Panama to carry firearms outside their 
respective work stations. 
  The PTJ official explained that the existing regulation on 
the issue of firearms prohibits foreign military personnel from 
carrying high-caliber weapons outside their work stations. 
  Mora said his office is not granting arms permits to U.S. 
soldiers in the country and "especially not if it involves 
weapons that can cause much destruction." 
  Mora said that during the electoral period the sale, 
exportation, and issue of firearms will be suspended to avert 
dangerous situations.
