Watching Jane Lapotaire these days is a very curious business. That we have
few actresses with such intelligence, authority or accomplishment must be
beyond question. Yet it has been years since I could believe in one of her
stage characterisations. Right now, London has the chance to see her in the
great role of Mrs Alving in Ibsen's Ghosts, with the RSC in the Pit.
Watching and listening to her, you cannot help but find new insights into
the role and into the whole fabric of this marvellous play; but you also see
a portrayal so calculated in moment-by-moment delivery, so full of clever
motifs, and so carefully arranged in its final expression of dismay, that it
creaks.
This is too bad, not just because of the waste of Lapotaire's talent, but
also because she dominates Katie Mitchell's staging of the play, excellent
in so many other respects. This production - which I reviewed at its
premiere at Stratford's The Other Place last May - now launches the RSC's
new London season. It embodies many of the best virtues of the RSC, of
Mitchell, and indeed of Lapotaire. For a close scrutiny of Ghosts, it is
unlikely to be surpassed for years to come.
Mitchell fastidiously observes the detailed realism of Ibsen's play. The
play is - among other things - about syphilis, and repression, and
hypocrisy, and women's struggle for social freedom; but, in Mitchell's
hands, those things are the more powerful because she never nudges them into
undue significance, or allows any anachronistic touch to remind us how
modern the play's implications are. Vicki Mortimer's designs are haunting,
perfectly creating the spartan elegance of a Norwegian interior. And Tina
MacHugh's lighting conveys both the darkness of this room, and the distant
pallor of the daylight outside (though the final dawn is none too
persuasive). Details of offstage sound, or the maid's duster, or Pastor
Manders's hat, all contribute beautifully to the eloquent whole.
Simon Russell Beale is a strongly morose Oswald. If one does not quite
believe that his last words would really be 'the sun, the sun', then one
certainly attends to his protest that sunshine and the joy of life have
never been part of his life at home. John Carlyle's Pastor Manders is a
superb performance, bringing a wealth of life to this stiff character.
Alexandra Galbraith and John Normington, however, have slightly coarsened
their detailed interpretations of Regina and Engstrand. Should their
self-servingness be quite so obvious?
The 'ghosts' become more fascinating the closer you attend. Lapotaire hints
in the first two acts that Oswald's father may not be the late Lieutenant
Alving but the still present Pastor. In the last act, however, she seems
simply to have given up this last vestige of her love for the Pastor.
In her most grand and repeated gesture, Lapotaire suggests that Mrs Alving
keeps being failed by men. She stretches out one arm - palm downward,
fingers parted like a claw - towards the memory of her husband, or the
Pastor, or her son. Then she lets the arm fall, slowly, slowly. But the
gesture sums up the failure of Lapotaire's performance. Trying to show Mrs
Alving's spontaneous emotions (normally very contained in her body
language), this gesture actually turns out to be the most unspontaneous
thing Lapotaire does.
