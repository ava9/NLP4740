"Something appealing, something appalling." 
</P>
<P>
That's what we're promised in the opening number of "A Funny Thing Happened on 
the Way to the Forum." Fortunately, California Music Theatre's "Forum," at 
Pasadena Civic Auditorium, offers more that's appealing than appalling. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a foregone conclusion, considering some of this group's recent 
productions, such as its recent "Kiss Me Kate." One big improvement is the 
audibility of the words. Nearly every phrase in Stephen Sondheim's score and 
the Burt Shevelove-Larry Gelbart book can be understood. 
</P>
<P>
The performances deserve to be understood too. The production is held together 
exceptionally well by E. E. Bell's Pseudolus, the wily Roman slave who hopes to 
win his freedom by uniting his young master Hero (Richard Waterhouse) with the 
dim-but-winsome object of his affections (Heather Lee). 
</P>
<P>
Bell looks so much like Zero Mostel, the original Pseudolus, that separate 
pictures of the two actors in the souvenir program look as if they could be 
depicting the same man. But Bell's Pseudolus has his own distinctive sweetness. 
</P>
<P>
With his ample double chin and twinkling eyes, Bell looks downright jolly. His 
conniving has a soft edge; when he sings of how he wants to be free, it's 
genuinely moving. Even his leering seems rather innocent. He zooms about the 
stage with precision and sings with power. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Tucci's Hysterium, the house servant who becomes a reluctant 
co-conspirator with Pseudolus, is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, exactly 
where he should be. 
</P>
<P>
Barney Martin's hangdog face is perfect for the role of Senex, the hen-pecked 
master of Pseudolus' household. Waterhouse and Lee are amusingly blithe as the 
young lovers; Lee in particular has adroit comic timing. "For us, there will 
never be happiness," she says with a sigh. "We will have to learn to be happy 
without it." Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Ritschel looks properly crass as the procurer. Harvey Vernon plays the 
aged neighbor with the same sense of vaudeville style that prevails throughout 
the production. Kelly Britt is a sharp-tongued harpie. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Netherton doesn't make the full-scale impression, vocally or physically, 
that Captain Miles Gloriosus ought to make. There were a couple of errant 
moments in Ward Carlisle's lighting design. The opening number wasn't quite as 
funny as you would expect "Comedy Tonight" to be; wasn't Jeff Rizzo's musical 
direction a little too slow at the top of the show? 
</P>
<P>
Generally, though, director Gary Davis and Rizzo deliver a smartly paced and 
sung "Forum." Best of all, for those who remember the most recent "Forum" at 
the Pantages, there is nothing resembling Mickey Rooney's stage-hogging. Now 
there was something that was more appalling than appealing. 
</P>

and Sunday matinees at 2 p.m., through July 2. Tickets: $15-$30; (213)
