THIS NEW account of Ibsen's Ghosts is nearly, so nearly, a classic. The play
works beautifully in the close surroundings of The Other Place, and the
performance shines with vintage RSC virtues. Every facet has been honed for
meaning, the actors play as a true ensemble, voices are handsomely produced
with a wide, musical range of nuance, and the designs are unobtrusively
attractive. Why then is the production less than ideal? Partly because of
two vintage RSC flaws: where the casting is perfect, the acting is not
always spontaneous; and where the acting is spontaneous, the casting is not
always perfect.
Set against these cavils, however, is the thrill of Ghosts itself. Above
all, it is about the choices - past, present, future - that tragically pin
down a woman who has married without love. She spends most of the play
breaking through one trap, only to meet a worse one.
Jane Lapotaire should be wonderfully cast as Mrs Alving. Every aspect of her
is turned into expression and character. You see the hopeful girl she was,
the sharp old woman she is becoming, and the severity and sorrow that have
shaped her. But why so much calculating (and sometimes melodramatic)
emphasis? Why repeat the same odd right-arm gesture of entreaty, the same
gaping mouth of dismay, so often? Why the pregnant pauses, the sobbing
break-up of sentences into disparate staccato words? Too much artifice.
The only artificial feature of Simon Russell Beale's Oswald is his
blonder-than-blonde hair. Tensely cool with Manders, respectful but guarded
with his mother, he reveals the angry young man in Oswald. But his
embittered air of disillusion - invaluable in roles from Thersites (Troilus)
to Richard III - rids Oswald of his idealism. Two months ago, a young actor,
Jonathan Wrather, played this role at the Palace Theatre Watford, with less
revealing detail but the kind of Montgomery Clift nervous intensity that
swept the play up into a thrilling near-apotheosis. When Beale asks for 'the
sun . . . the sun . . . ', I am gripped by the shocking dullness of his tone
 -yet I cannot believe that sun is what he wants.
But expecting to find a flawless performance of a major Ibsen role is like
looking for a garden without weeds. Each character is so multi-dimensional
that it presents an actor with a supreme challenge. Manders, for example, is
more gullible and slow-witted than John Carlisle shows. In every other
respect, however, Carlisle is exemplary. He reveals Manders's morality from
several sides - the blinkered Calvinist rigour, the tender, grave idealism
(which attracted Mrs Alving), the insensitive rectitude that renders him
eventually laughable. And played with utter ease.
John Normington's Engstrand is a plausible crook. Alexandra Gilbreath's
Regina is radiant, servile and pushy - a marvellous mix. Vikki Mortimer's
designs and Tina MacHugh's lighting, beautiful in themselves, entirely serve
the play. Katie Mitchell, always a master of intimate space, directs the
play as a powerful web of eloquently interacting details.
At The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, until July 24 and later in the
season.
