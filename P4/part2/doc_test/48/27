  [Text] Astonishment and excitement on Lerchenberg in 
Mainz. ZDF, one of the biggest European broadcasting stations, 
had concluded a cooperation agreement with the Iranian state 
television, IRIB, in 1991. Now the people in Mainz had to learn 
from French judicial circles that their partners are said to be 
involved in the state terrorism of the mullahs. 
  "We are shocked," said Petra Zilken from the ZDF department 
for international affairs, "we have to think thoroughly about 
further cooperation." 
  The serious accusation is made in a charge that was filed by 
the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office in Paris and has been 
secret so far. The file sent to the Elysee Palace deals with 
the murder of former Iranian Prime Minister Shapur Bakhtiar. 
Three men killed the politician, who had escaped to French 
exile, by numerous knife thrusts on 6 August 1991. 
  Before the end of this year, the presumable perpetrators are 
to be brought to trial in Paris. 
  After several dozen assassination attempts in Europe, among 
them the assassination of exiled Iranians in the Berlin 
"Mykonos" restaurant, it has now become known for the first 
time: Iran regularly used its television correspondents to 
provide the logistics for the killers. According to the French 
investigators, in this way they organized papers, apartments, 
and cars. Their advantage: Because of their cooperation with 
big European television stations, they enjoy hospitality in many 
places and can move unhindered everywhere. 
  In the case of Bakhtiar's murder, the wirepuller was in the 
Rue de Liege 27: Massoud Hendi [spelling as published], 45, 
Paris bureau chief of the Persian television station, IRIB, and 
nephew of Ayatollah Khomeyni. Hendi procured the visas for the 
two Iranian agents who have to stand trial for Bakhtiar's 
murder. Hendi himself is also detained. 
  A document of the French prosecutors shows that the Iranian 
Ministry for Telecommunications, partner of ZDF and other 
television stations, is doing the preliminary work for the 
assassination commands. 
  The Swiss television station, SRG, which only concluded an 
agreement with the Iranians in November 1993, reacted 
immediately. "Until the accusations are clarified, our agreement 
will be suspended," said Oswald Sigg, spokesman of the SRG 
executive board. 
  Tehran's answer came promptly. Last Thursday, Rudolf 
Weiersmueller, Swiss ambassador to Iran, was called to the 
Foreign Ministry. He had to receive a sharp protest note from 
the mullahs -- a further leg in the controversy between 
Switzerland and Iran, which has been smoldering for some time. 
  The Alpine republic has an international arrest warrant for 
Mohsen Sharif Esfahani, 39, and Ahmad Taheri [spelling as 
published], 32. Together with others, they are said to have 
executed former UN diplomat Kazem Radjavi [spelling as 
published] in his Geneva exile in April 1990. 
  The wanted persons were imprisoned in France. In the event 
of their extradition, which had been demanded by Switzerland, 
Tehran threatened a "firework of bombs" toward French mediator 
Jean Charles Marchiani. With success: The presumable 
terrorists were permitted to leave unmolested for Iran. 
  The German Federal Government was also well out of it 
because, before their trip to France, the presumable murderers 
had travelled from Frankfurt to Aachen -- watched by German 
security authorities. 
  On 17 November 1992, the Swiss police briefed the Federal 
Office of Criminal Investigation: "Ahmed Taheri and Sharif 
Esfahani, who were arrested in Paris, are suspects in the 
RADJAVI [preceding word capitalized] murder case." 
  The French received the decisive tipoff for the arrest from 
their German colleagues.
