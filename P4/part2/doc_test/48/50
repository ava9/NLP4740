I ENJOYED myself on New Year's eve. I took my assistant, Miss Lee, to dinner
at the Moody Mango in Mayfair. Ordinarily, the prices are so steep at the
Moody Mango that I have to wait until I am invited, but the last time I was
there I won a door prize, dinner for two on New Year's eve. So off we went
in the trusty Rover, dressed to kill.
I had toyed with inviting Norman Lamont to join our table. I have been
ruder, for longer, about Norman than almost anyone. Right from the word go]
I thought: something's not right here, it will all end in tears. Which is
why it occured to me, on New Year's eve, that magnanimity would be in order,
especially as Norman and I will be Notting Hill neighbours in 1992, as soon
as he leaves Downing Street.
But then another thought struck me. Would it be fair to invite Norman to the
Moody Mango and ignore the other doomed ministerial souls who appeared in
this column in 1991? John Major? Kenneth Baker? Malcolm Rifkind?
Answer: it would not have been fair, so I did not invite him. But Miss Lee
and I were not short of company at the Moody Mango, for those in attendance
included many of my closest friends, all of whom surfaced in this column
last year.
Miss Lee was at her loveliest. She is a fortysomething Yorkshirewoman, well
to the right of centre, who spends absurd sums on clothes at the dreadful
Harvey Nicks. But that is her only fault. She has poise. She is fragrant.
And she counterbalances my own glum moods and (very minor) pretentiousness.
'Have you made a New Year's resolution?' asked Miss Lee, candlelight dancing
in her blue-green eyes.
'No,' I said, through mouthfuls of pesce ai ferri alla moda dell'Adriatico.
'Too banal by half. I read last weekend that Will Carling's resolution for
1992 was to drink less coffee. What a potato] Who is Will Carling?'
'You know perfectly well, Michael. We're not at home, tonight, to Mr
Silly-Talk.'
Just then, Jack Hillbrooke, Britain's richest bookmaker, crossed the room to
greet us, accompanied by two other dear friends, Sheikh Walli Al-kaljabi and
Lady Catherine de Moubray-ffrench-Moubray. All three were sombre.
'Hi there, Jack,' I said. 'And what is your resolution for 1992? To bleed
the last drop of blood from the hapless punters? Or you, Sheikh Walli? To
buy another 1,500 racehorses? Catherine? To change your Korean chauffeurs
even more frequently?'
None of this went down well.
'I am battening the hatches,' said Jack. 'Everywhere I look I see grave
uncertainty. Never before have I stood at the edge of a volcano like 1992.
Survival is the only game in town.' Sheikh Walli said that he was
downscaling his racing empire fast because of less-than-Dollars 18 oil,
while Lady Catherine announced that she was firing staff. 'Cook's gone, and
the assistant gardener. What a dire, dire mess. Is civilisation ending? If
it were not for my chauffeurs I would be utterly bereft.'
The next friend to greet us was Rory d'Avigold-Teaze, the theatrical
impresario, accompanied by Penelope Powdermaker, the hot-shot media
interviewer. Both of those were downcast, as was the trio of image-builders
who came to our table next: Ron Manworthy, sports psychologist, Juliet
Fetherbrayne, London's highest-paid PR, and Micky Muff, founder of the
post-punk school of English cooking.
Micky's restaurant has closed. Juliet's PR consultancy is up to its spangled
neck in debt. Ron's business has evaporated. Rory reckons that only 17 new
Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals can save London's theatreland from doom. And
Penelope Powdermaker said there was no one left to interview. 'No one, that
is, who hasn't been interviewed to death or isn't hideously compromised and
tainted by the foul-ups of the 1980s.'
Just before midnight, Wayne Talent, gaunt, groomed, 28-ish, slipped into the
spare seat at our table. 'Thought I'd never make it. London's jammed, innit?
So what about '92, Mike? You with all your cred. Must have heard sumthin'.'
Wayne is the younger brother of Keith Talent, the darts-playing west London
racketeer of Martin Amis's novel, London Fields.
'No, Wayne, I haven't. How about yourself?'
'The word on the street,' said Wayne, 'is that everything's breaking up,
it's all crashing down. The universe is dying. So I'm doing a bunk. In five
hours' time I'll be aloft in first-class, winging me way to Sarawak. I'm
going to ground, Mike, as far away from bother as money can get.' And then
he was gone.
It was midnight. I said to Miss Lee: 'Now I know we're in deadly trouble.
Happy New Year, Miss Lee. I think we should ring the airline.'
