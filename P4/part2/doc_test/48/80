  [Text] Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta has said that 
recent kidnappings and the assassination of Javier Barahona, the 
deputy mayor of Wiwili, are desperate actions by criminal gangs 
trying to undermine peace. Mendieta added that the government 
is working to combat this situation. 
  [Begin Mendieta recording] We are prepared to fully 
guarantee 
that the disarmament process of the 3-80 Northern Front will 
conclude satisfactorily on 8 April, as scheduled, and that the 
second phase of disarmament will begin tomorrow without any 
delay. [end recording] 
  Mendieta said he would meet with high-ranking EPS [Sandinist 
People's Army] officers to counter the criminal gangs. 
  [Begin recording of Colonel Oswaldo Lacayo, member of the 
EPS 
General Staff] We will conduct operations in full coordination 
with the group being disarmed in the areas surrounding the 3-80 
Northern Front disarmament area to prevent any problems. [end 
recording] 
  According to the EPS, gangs such as those under the command 
of Charro, Nortiel, and Omar are trying to hinder the 
disarmament process, but the International Commission of Support 
and Verification-OAS [CIAV-OAS] believes the peace process is 
well under way. 
  [Begin recording of Sergio Carabana, CIAV-OAS 
representative] 
These incidents are isolated. I believe the government will 
take steps in this regard, and we will help conduct a thorough 
investigation to find the culprits. [end recording] 
  The CIAV-OAS will propose that Barahona's case be discussed 
by the tripartite commission.
