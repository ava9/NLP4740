THE CHANGING rhythms of history mark each of these novels: the colour and
horror of 20th century Russia and America for Rubens and Thomas; the
turnabout in social mores and morals from post-war to contemporary Britain
for Bowen and Wesley. Mother Russia traces the fates of two families, one
aristocratic, the other peasant, from the same Russian village, through war,
revolution, Stalinism and glasnost. In both families, there is the
revolutionary brother and the reactionary one, and their inevitable role
reversals as victim and aggressor; and then the youngest children, Sasha and
Anna, born on the same day in 1900 and suckled together by the peasant
mother, one a poet, the other his muse, who marry across class boundaries
and continue to stand for love against ideology and brutal conviction.
They live in a heightened state of terror yet hysterical hope; separated for
years, they search Russia, by train, on foot, for one another; ending up at
the home of protective brother Ivan, they watch him turn from revolutionary
spirit to KGB torturer. Epic in conception, unflagging in moral energy, the
scope of Bernice Rubens' novel commands only admiration. Old Rubens themes
light up here in a new constellation: the need for faith, the effect of
apocalyptic movements on individuals and families. There is her
tender-rigorous prose; the purring way she enhances her shocks ('the noose
laced his neck', 'the rage comforted and clothed him', 'a ragged regiment of
thugs . . . coagulated by a raving lunatic'); her ability to draw minor
characters - the revolutionary idealist Pavlenkov, losing faith and weeping
for his wife as he is hung, the old Jewish printer Chernov, stumbling into
the hands of Tsarist police while others escape - with whom we shiver, fear,
melt at the knees.
But this is a fatally uneven work. Halfway through, Rubens' grip slackens,
precisely tuned detail gives way to a glib encapsulation of recent history.
Climax follows climax; rape, decapitation, torture, Nazi spying and
shootings occur within a few pages; parallels between families are forced;
the story becomes a history lesson ('There are other causes beside the
revolution. The making of poetry is one of them'). We get schematic writing
instead of surprise, explanation instead of authenticity - and without a
setting which is the very essence of the tale, which feels as deeply and
instantly Russian as Nadine Gordimer's novels are South African or Bashevis
Singer's Polish, Mother Russia ceases to be a serious historical novel and
ends an upmarket blockbuster.
John Bowen's The Precious Gift is a thriller which is that and much more.
Sarah, a young mother in retreat from London, finds the skeleton of a
pregnant woman in her Warwickshire garden. If this was murder, it happened
40 years ago and the police give it a low priority, but Sarah becomes
obsessed with the victim, and in playing detective she unleashes a small
torrent of fear, resentment and panicky concealment in the local village.
As in Bowen's last novel, Fighting Back, sudden rural violence is seamlessly
incorporated into what appears to be a quiet story of English village life.
The mood, crossing social realism and class satire with film noir and a
touch of Arsenic and Old Lace, is all Bowen's own; the language is deadpan,
authoritative, stylish. A psychologist as acute on the frustrated
schoolteacher and vicar's wife of the 1940s as on the 1990s desperate
professional or yuppy housewife, he manages to sketch alliances across half
a century without ever letting characters degenerate into mere types.
Fulfilment, independence, the imaginative versus the actual life, women's
roles and options are his wider themes, sensitively handled and with always
a hint that dark fantasies - any character's wildest dreams - could just tip
over into the reality of murder.
Horror in Mary Wesley's novels is of the comfortable Gothic sort: here a mad
wife causes havoc from the bedroom of a country mansion and an eccentric
cockatoo troubles guests at dinner. A Dubious Legacy is the story of wealthy
Henry, who has inherited house, spouse and bird, and his relationship from
the 1950s to the 1980s with his friends' wives Antonia and Barbara, as they
grow over the decades from innocence to worldliness. Ms Wesley breezes along
with customary grace and nonchalance, sniping maliciously at her characters
while giving them a more or less good time, chuckling in the face of
disaster, smartening up a skimpy plot with comic turns or a spot of torture
for the wretched cockatoo whenever predictability threatens to settle in.
Ms Wesley belongs to the stiff upper lip school of fiction; her chin only
wobbles at the thought of all those weekend extravaganzas and Chelsea
afternoons that peal like bells through her pages. Her hero Henry tries to
recreate his parents' pre-war lifestyle; Ms Wesley seems to me to yearn for
the guileful elegance of Coward or Maugham and to reconstitute set-piece
English marital comedy in a near-contemporary environment: brittle, amusing
but seldom staying in the mind.
Finally, back to international history and DM Thomas's look at Kennedy's
assassination through the dreams and reveries of a nun who has shaken hands
with him, of Lee Harvey Oswald, and of JFK himself. Ten thousand dreams a
night, a Dallas psychologist tells Sister Agnes in Flying Into Love, are
dreamt about Kennedy's murder. Thomas, slicing in and out of a Texas convent
and the triple underpass in Dealy Plaza through which Kennedy's motorcade
dashed to hospital, shunting between 1963 and 1992, tries to create a
meaningful melange of these illusions and fantasies, but the result is a
messy pudding of aimless episodes and overblown dramas. Flying Into Love has
neither narrative power nor a particularised vision; Thomas's skill as a
vivid scene-maker sometimes shines through, but here his energy is wasted in
empty showmanship.
