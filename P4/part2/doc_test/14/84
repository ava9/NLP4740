Joycean New Year: Never finished the book? KCRW-FM (89.9) will give James Joyce 
fans a New Year's treat by broadcasting an unedited and uninterrupted reading 
of "Ulysses." 
</P>
<P>
The blockbuster reading of Joyce's opus, produced by Irish Radio, was last 
heard on KCRW five years ago on New Year's Eve. The story airs Sunday from 6 
p.m. to midnight, Monday from 6 p.m. to 4 a.m. and Tuesday from 8 a.m. to 4:30 
p.m. and 6 p.m. to midnight. The reading is performed by a cast of more than 30 
Irish actors. BETH KLEID
