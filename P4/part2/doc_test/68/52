and territory have swept in with the new political season

HUNGARY'S far right, restless but dormant for the past two years of moderate
conservative government, has burst into life without warning. Its issues of
race and territory swept more mundane matters of budgets and economic reform
off the agenda as parliament reconvened this week as the new political
season began after the summer recess.
The political talk is suddenly focused on the danger of 'Balkan chaos' and
Hungary's prized stability - which made the country the favourite for
western investors - is looking surface-deep.
What stirred the waters was an article in the party weekly by Mr Istvan
Csurka, a vice president and leading ideologist of the Hungarian Democratic
Forum, the ruling centre-right party. It has been received as a manifesto so
explosive that it has been termed an 'intellectual Molotov cocktail'.
Mr Csurka, a former novelist with the bulk - both physical and political -
of a Jean Marie Le Pen, called true Hungarians to arms in a tract which
opponents have described as nothing less than a foundation for Hungarian
neo-Nazism.
He demanded an end to moderation and compromise, linking Jews, communists,
liberals, the International Monetary Fund and bankers in a conspiracy to
destroy the government and smother Hungary's national revival.
Anti-Semitic remarks littered the text, with Mr Csurka writing of the
influence of 'the Paris, New York and Tel Aviv networks' and of 'the
Hungarian Jewish position of hegemony'.
In a sideswipe at western interference, he accused the IMF of pulling the
strings behind the new financial elite, comparing the institution to the
occupying Red Army which propped up the communists.
He even called into question the Trianon peace treaty, the territorial
settlement after the First World War which cost Hungary 60 per cent of its
land area and left 3.5m ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring states.
With borders starting to unravel all over the Balkans and eastern Europe, he
relished 'the opportunities to create a new Hungarian living space'.
Mr Csurka's essay can - and has been by opposition politicians - be
dismissed lightly as the rantings of an anti-Semite who has come out of the
closet. More significant, however, has been the reluctance of Mr Jozsef
Antall, the moderate prime minister, and the party he leads, to condemn the
author outright and force his resignation.
After a week of mounting pressure, the prime minister this week belatedly
and begrudgingly distanced himself from Mr Csurka's standpoint, describing
parts of the essay as 'politically mistaken and harmful'.
But Mr Antall reassured Mr Csurka and his Volk-national right-wingers that
there was an important place for them in the governing party. The latter's
national committee went even further in support of Mr Csurka, concluding in
its communique: 'The bulk of the essay's foundations are very useful in
working out the Hungarian Democratic Forum's new programme.'
It is the party's accommodation of Mr Csurka's outburst, rather than the
words themselves, that is causing observers to look more seriously at the
challenge from the far right.
Mr Csurka, one of the founding heroes of the Forum, is believed to command
the allegiance of up to a third of the ruling party's activists. Mr Antall,
an innately cautious personality, can ill afford to force a deep split
within his own party when both his coalition partners are also increasingly
rebellious. He is even less disposed to react at a time when his government
is trailing badly in the opinion polls and still reeling from two
by-elections at which ministers suffered humiliating defeats.
But Mr Csurka's constituency is more than just a faction within the Forum,
and the debate about his essay goes beyond internal party politics. He has
articulated the frustration of many Hungarians with the government's
apparent inability or reluctance to purge those people who made their money
or influence under the former communist regime. Their indignation has grown
as Hungary's economic depression has deepened and thrown the growing wealth
of communists-turned-businessmen into relief.
Furthermore, Mr Csurka's extreme rhetoric taps a strong Hungarian vein of
virulent nationalism and anti-Semitism. In their hearts, many Hungarians
have not given up the territories they lost after the first world war, nor
stopped casting around for scapegoats for this national tragedy.
Territorial ambition and racism led to Hungary's wartime alliance with Nazi
Germany when 600,000 Hungarian Jews died, most in German concentration
camps, but up to 100,000 in Hungary at the hands of Hungarians, according to
Jewish leaders.
But even Forum supporters who admit the anti-Semitism in Mr Csurka's
thinking do not want to see him forced out. 'Csurka cannot be evicted from
the political scene. The best place for him is the Forum because the Forum
can moderate him,' says one.
The opposition predictably sees it the other way around. 'Your party is the
prisoner of Csurka,' said Mr Laszlo Kover, an opposition leader, pointing
accusingly across the parliamentary chamber at Forum MPs.
Their disagreement leaves open the question, and it is an old one: when
moderates pander to extremists in order to tame them, who controls whom?
