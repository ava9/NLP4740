This country's reform Communists won a decisive battle against conservatives 
Saturday when the party, in an unprecedented move, named prominent economist 
and reformer Rezso Nyers as the new Communist Party chairman and appointed a 
four-man team to steer party politics until the next Communist congress in 
October, Hungarian Radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
The decision effectively strips General Secretary Karoly Grosz, 58, of much of 
his power and places Hungary's leadership in the hands of a reform-minded 
majority that says it wants to transform Hungary into a socialist democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Grosz, who was hailed as a reformer as recently as 13 months ago when he took 
power from longtime Communist leader Janos Kadar, has come under increasing 
criticism in recent months as a fumbling centrist who lacks the vision to steer 
Hungary into the future. 
</P>
<P>
A Communist Party spokesman said that Grosz would retain the title of general 
secretary until the party congress, now set for Oct. 7, but that the party will 
be run by Grosz, Nyers, reformist Premier Miklos Nemeth, 42, and Minister of 
State and Politburo member Imre Pozsgay, 55. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The 'Hungarian Gorbachev' 
</P>
<P>
Pozsgay is called the "Hungarian Gorbachev" by some and is the country's most 
popular and closely watched reform politician. He is currently consolidating 
support from both party members and opposition groups and is widely expected to 
make his move for Hungary's leadership in October. 
</P>
<P>
Nyers, 65, who pioneered Hungary's first economic reforms in the late 1960s but 
was ousted from the Politburo in 1973 for advocating rapid change, is enjoying 
a comeback today that is rare among East Bloc politicians. He was renamed to 
the Politburo in May, 1988, when Grosz took office as part of the progressive 
wind that also swept Pozsgay into his Politburo seat. 
</P>
<P>
Nyers assumes an honorary position created for Janos Kadar when he was deposed 
as general secretary, but the reinstated reformer has told the Hungarian press 
that he intends to play more than just a ceremonial role, although it is not 
clear how much power he will actually have. The post has been empty since the 
Politburo stripped Kadar, now 77 and in ailing health, of that title last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the party also announced that hard-liner Janos Berecz, a former 
Communist Party secretary for ideology and propaganda, would head an institute 
for political science that has not yet been founded. This announcement, along 
with the others made on Hungarian Radio on Saturday, indicate that Hungary's 
reformers have won a battle against hard-liners during a protracted Central 
Committee meeting that started Friday morning and continued into Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition party leaders hailed the news. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that with the leadership of Pozsgay and Nyers, a new party can be 
born," said Gabor Demszky, a leader of the Alliance of Free Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary has made great strides toward economic and political reform in the past 
13 months, but critics say Grosz has not kept pace and has in fact angered many 
Hungarians by his contradictory and often unclear comments. 
</P>
<P>
The general secretary has also been unable to resolve a growing and now openly 
admitted rift between party progressives and more orthodox Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Reform Communists, who are looking ahead to multi-party elections that could be 
held by the end of this year, say they must consolidate their numbers and gain 
the upper hand in the party's leadership if they hope to win public support at 
the polls. 
</P>
<P>
While leading Communists hesitate to criticize Grosz by name, Hungarian 
Parliament Speaker Matyas Szuros said Thursday: "A politician who is 
inconsistent and makes contradictory statements discredits himself. . . . We 
have to prepare for the congress with a leadership whose members are at least 
in solidarity with one another and act in harmony." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors that Grosz would resign have abounded for several months. They were 
fueled last week when Grosz failed to appear at a meeting with opposition 
groups who are working with the Communists to hammer out new property and 
election legislation that will then be given to the National Assembly, or 
Parliament, to approve. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Communist delegation was chaired by Pozsgay. Nyers and Pozsgay 
have also gained high marks for attending the ceremony honoring former 
Hungarian Premier Imre Nagy, who was given a patriot's burial June 16 after 
being executed as a traitor for his role in the 1956 uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Grosz, as leader of the Communist Party, was pointedly excluded from the 
ceremony by its organizers. He had further angered many by his remarks about 
the Communist Party's attitude toward Nagy, who is now officially recognized as 
having been executed after a show trial.
