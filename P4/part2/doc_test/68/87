program] 
  [Text] The Nonaligned Movement's [NAM] 11th ministerial 
conference attentively heard and included in the final 
declaration basic Cuban foreign policy concepts that Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina's delegation expounded in Cairo. Cuba 
terms as satisfactory the fact that the Cairo Declaration issues 
an appeal to end the U.S. economic blockade against the island, 
guarantees the Movement's continuity, and demands the 
establishment of equitable relations between developed and 
underdeveloped nations to achieve justice and equality. 
  The 109 countries represented at the ministerial conference 
urged the U.S. Government to abstain from carrying out actions 
against Cuba if these contradict the good-neighbor policy. They 
also requested the return of Guantanamo Naval Base and the 
effective and immediate implementation of the UN resolutions on 
the blockade. It may be recalled that the UN General Assembly 
issued statements in 1992 and 1993 advocating suspension of the 
economic blockade against Cuba, but the United States has yet to 
comply with the letter and spirit of the appeal. 
  During his so-called message to Cubans on 20 May, President 
William Clinton not only manipulated Cuban history with evil 
intentions but also reasserted that he will maintain the 
economic boycott against the island. The Cairo Declaration 
signed at the NAM's 11th ministerial conference also said the 
adjustment programs and the foreign debt should not affect human 
development programs, a concept that coincides with Cuba's 
views. Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina had emphasized before 
the plenary session that the NAM's number one priority is to 
sponsor Third World nations' economic and social development. 
Robaina said in Cairo that the best guarantee for a permanent 
and durable peace is to end hunger. He said: If we do nothing, 
we will be condemned to disappear, meaning two-thirds of mankind 
would disappear. 
  The conference in Egypt also discussed a reorganization of 
the United Nations so that it fulfills the wishes and goals of 
the poorest countries, which represents one of the basic points 
in Cuba's foreign policy. The decision adopted by those 
gathered in Cairo to grant the Colombian city of Cartagena de 
Indias the right to host the 11th summit of NAM leaders and 
heads of state also represents encouraging news, given the need 
to review specific problems in the region. Most of those 
problems are similar to the ones which prevail in Cuba, except 
the old Cuban-U.S. dispute. 
  The NAM's ministerial conference, which just ended, proved 
Cuba's active role in the Movement and the endorsement that its 
proposals, views, and demands for support receive in that forum.
