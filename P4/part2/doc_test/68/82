A Westminster couple's four-day hunger strike in front of a federal immigration 
office came to a happy ending Thursday afternoon when top immigration officials 
said the woman's ailing mother will be allowed to emigrate from Romania to the 
United States after all. 
</P>
<P>
"God Bless these men for helping this poor woman get here," the sunburned and 
unshaven Vasile Sofroni said at the end of his 80-hour fast in Westminster to 
win an entry visa for his mother-in-law, Livia Groza, 54. 
</P>
<P>
"My legs are shaking. I don't know if it's from lack of food or from 
happiness," he said outside the INS office in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Ezell, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service's western 
regional commissioner, told Sofroni and his wife, Lia, both 31, that acting INS 
Commissioner James Buck had personally reviewed Groza's case Thursday morning 
in Washington. Ezell said Buck decided that Groza did qualify for a special 
humanitarian visa. 
</P>
<P>
Ezell said the visa means that Groza, who has a serious heart condition and 
hasn't been able to work for five years, can now legally come to the United 
States and stay indefinitely. He explained that the government, on rare 
occasions, grants special visas for humanitarian reasons, to aliens who 
otherwise cannot legally enter the United States with a regular immigrant visa. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's decision is in line with our policy to promote family unity by 
offering special consideration. . . . This family should be together here in 
the United States," Ezell said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Sofronis launched their fast in the INS parking lot at 5 a.m. Monday after 
three years of efforts, including assistance from Rep. Robert K. Dornan 
(R-Garden Grove), failed to win entry for Groza. 
</P>
<P>
Vasile Sofroni said he had become increasingly concerned about his 
mother-in-law's welfare when money he sent failed to reach her in Dimisoara, 
Romania. 
</P>
<P>
The INS originally denied Groza's petition for a humanitarian visa in early 
May, saying that she was still young enough to support herself and therefore 
did not have to be with her closest living relatives, the Sofronis, who have 
permanent U.S. residency status, the couple said. 
</P>
<P>
Ezell said that Groza's case, which was being handled by the INS office in 
Washington, came to his attention when he saw a local TV news broadcast 
Wednesday night about the couple's hunger strike. 
</P>
<P>
Ezell said that both he and Dornan called acting INS Commissioner Buck early 
Thursday and asked him to personally examine the request. 
</P>
<P>
Buck interceded, overruling other INS officials to whom the Sofronis had been 
appealing for various entry visas for about three years. Ezell said the INS 
already has sent a cable to the U.S. Embassy in Romania, advising officials 
there that a visa has been approved. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a belated Fourth of July gift to the Sofronis. We talked to Mr. Buck 
and explained that the State Department had already given the OK," said 
Patricia Fanelli, a Dornan aide. She said the congressman has been working on 
Groza's case since last year. 
</P>
<P>
Sofroni said Thursday that he and his wife were driven to fasting because 
Dornan's office "promised all this time, and they keep trying, but nothing 
changed. (We got) the same answers," and because Groza was not getting the 
money they were sending to Romania. 
</P>
<P>
" 'I don't know what you are doing, Vasile, but I see nothing from you,' " he 
said his mother-in-law told him in a telephone conversation in April. 
</P>
<P>
That is when Sofroni said he decided to act. "I said no more waiting. . . . If 
I don't help her, she is going to die because nobody else there to help her." 
</P>
<P>
INS officials emphasized that without valid grounds for granting a humanitarian 
visa request, the hunger strike would have done no good. 
</P>
<P>
"The hunger strike was not the reason parole status was granted. . . . There 
was a lot of hard evidence to support their claim in the second review," INS 
spokesman Ron Rogers said.
