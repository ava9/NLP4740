'DESIGNING WOMEN' WILL TAKE ON WEIGHTY ISSUES

<P>
As a teen-ager, she won 18 beauty pageants. In 1975, as Miss Florida, she won 
the Miss America talent contest with a dramatic presentation. 
</P>
<P>
But she was forever fighting extra pounds, and this television season it is 
obvious that "Designing Women's" Delta Burke, although still beautiful, has 
grown heavy. Plump. Chunky. Stout. Fat. 
</P>
<P>
Burke does not deny it. On a recent edition of "Entertainment Tonight," she 
said that she had used so many diet pills and amphetamines that she has 
disturbed her body's chemical balance and now gains weight even more easily. 
</P>
<P>
So this week "They Shoot Fat Women, Don't They?" is an episode that creator 
Linda Bloodworth-Thomason calls "our valentine to overweight people 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
But the CBS series looks at both sides of a coin: people who get fat and people 
who are starving. 
</P>
<P>
In Monday's installment, Burke, as Suzanne Sugarbaker, attends her high-school 
reunion and finds that her extra avoirdupois has become the topic du jour among 
former classmates. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, she is rather cruelly voted "Classmate Who Has Changed the Most." Her 
off-the-cuff acceptance speech reveals how much she has really changed. 
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, Burke's husband, actor Gerald McRaney, Marine-fit for his role on 
another CBS series, "Major Dad," attended the taping of that installment. 
</P>
<P>
Bloodworth-Thomason combines Suzanne Sugarbaker's story with that of a 48-hour 
fast by her slimmer sister Julia (Dixie Carter) and tiny colleague Mary Jo 
Shively (Annie Potts) as part of the "Primetime to End Hunger" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The series will offer a clearinghouse telephone number to provide viewers with 
information on local groups participating in the campaign against hunger, 
homelessness and poverty.
