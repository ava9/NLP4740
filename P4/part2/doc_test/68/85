  [Text] Marut Bunnak, in a last-ditch effort to find a 
solution to the current political crisis threatening the 
country's fledgling democracy, used his powers yesterday as 
parliament president to unilaterally order the formation of an 
ad hoc House committee to draft a new constitution and initiate 
political reforms. 
  The 21-member committee, according to Marut, will be made up 
of prominent members of society including academics, military 
men and people from all walks of life as well as social critic 
Prawet Wasi and Chalat Worachat who is currently staging a 
fast-to-the-death on Parliament's doorstep. 
  The parliament president said if a good constitution was 
drafted, it may be proposed to the House for deliberation. In 
that event, MPs may ask the House to scrap Article 211 of the 
Constitution which, although it allows amendments to the 
charter, prohibits the drafting of a brand-new constitution. 
  Marut's intentions are indeed honourable, but as the saying 
goes: the road to hell is often paved with good intentions gone 
astray. And indeed we are now on that road. 
  When the parliament president informed Chalat yesterday of 
the formation of the new committee, the hunger striker 
outrightly rejected it and refused to end his fast. On 
Wednesday, close to 5,000 people rallied behind Chalat to demand 
a new constitution and speaker after speaker used the 
opportunity to lambast the Chuan government for its hardline 
stance against their demands. 
  The fact of the matter is that whatever draft constitution 
the ad hoc House committee comes up with, it will not be binding 
on any party and will be nothing more than just a draft. The 
harsh reality is that the current joint House-Senate 
Constitution Scrutinizing Committee, dominated by the 
opposition, will not under any circumstances bow to proposals to 
have Article 211 amended. 
  One of Chalat's core demands is that the Senate must be 
denied any role whatsoever in drafting the new constitution. 
  If Article 211 is to be voted upon by Parliament, at the 
suggestion of the joint house-senate committee, that would mean 
opposition MPs would have to cut their ties with the 
military-dominated Senate in their current joint alliance 
against the Chuan coalition and vote with government MPs. 
  In March both the opposition and the Senate joined hands to 
defeat the government-sponsored motions to make the Constitution 
more democratic. 
  When Phalang Tham hardliner Chaiwat Sinsuwong said on 
Wednesday night "devils are becoming angels and vice versa", he 
perhaps should have thought twice. Leopards will never change 
their spots no matter what. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai also cannot be absolved from 
blame for the current political mess. 
  Early on Tuesday, the premier agreed that the five parties 
in 
the government would hammer out details to form a committee to 
consider political reforms in the House. Though it wasn't what 
Chalat actually demanded, the hunger striker appeared receptive 
to the idea and indicated he would end his fast-to-the death 
ritual. That seemed to be an amicable end to the conundrum. 
  But within 24 hours, Chuan did an about-face and retracted 
his earlier statements saying a lone hunger striker could not be 
allowed to hold the government to ransom and certain 
"principles" had to be adhered to even if that meant dissolving 
the House and calling a general election. 
  It now seems the rot has set in for the collapse of Chuan's 
moribund government. An open revolt within the Phalang Tham 
Party [PTP], a main coalition partner, is threatening to break 
the party asunder. Nearly half of the PTP's 47 MPs have refused 
to withdraw a motion submitted to the House to form a committee 
to draft a new charter despite the Chuan coalition deciding 
against the motion. The rebel MPs from the PTP's "temple 
faction" are pressuring the party to break away from the 
coalition. 
  Clearly there now seems to be a no-win situation for either 
the Chuan coalition or the "Friends of Chalat" who are 
threatening another mass rally outside Parliament. 
  Dissolution of the House is inevitable. Let the ballot box 
decide everything. 
  A society which turns over the reins of government not by 
street demonstrations but by the vote, does not allow any 
political movement which is outside the electoral process to 
gain power. 
  We want political reforms and stability, but the way things 
are going now seems to indicate otherwise. The last thing the 
country needs is another bloodbath.
