RIOT police clubbed four women unconscious and fired shots into the air in
Nairobi's central Uhuru (Independence) Park to disperse a group of women
hunger-strikers and several hundred supporters, Reuter reports from the
Kenyan capital.
Witnesses said police waded into the group of about 50 women - many of them
mothers of prisoners - who had begun their hunger strike on Friday with an
appeal to Mr Amos Wako, the attorney-general, to release all 52 people they
say are in jail for politically related offences.
Mr Wako has promised to review the cases but said he could not guarantee all
the prisoners would be released
Witnesses said that four women, including a leading member of the political
opposition, Wangari Maathai, were clubbed unconscious and taken to hospital
in supporters' cars.
Police fired tear gas repeatedly and fired several shots in the air after
some demonstrators threw stones at passing vehicles, including a bus
belonging to a state transport company identified with President Daniel arap
Moi.
The government had ordered the women to end their protest, saying that it
had been taken over by opposition supporters who were using it to cause
unrest in the city. A spokesman said: 'The opposition has hijacked the
mothers' strike to promote their own selfish political interests, resulting
in rapid deterioration of security.'
AP adds: The US has halted all new development aid to Kenya and suspended a
small military training programme, a US Embassy official said in Nairobi
yesterday. He said the cut-off was forced by the legislation under which the
US Congress mandated a halt to all but food aid to countries six months in
arrears on loan repayments.
He said Kenya was six months in arrears on repayment of housing loan
guarantees and the arrears would reach Dollars 4m on April 1.
