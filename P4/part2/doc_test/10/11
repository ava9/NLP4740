  [Text] Beijing, April 20 (AFP)--China said Wednesday [20 
April] it hoped former US President Richard Nixon, whose 
historic 1972 visit here paved the way for the restoration of 
Sino-US ties, would recover soon from a severe stroke. "Nixon 
is an old friend of the Chinese people. He has made positive 
contributions to the development of Sino-US relations," a 
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said. "We hope Mr. Nixon will 
recover soon," she said. 
  The 81-year-old former president was rushed back into 
intensive care in a New York hospital as his condition 
deteriorated late Tuesday after suffering a stroke that left him 
partially paralysed. "There are potentially poor outcomes. His 
prognosis is guarded," Dr. Fred Plum told reporters at the 
hospital. 
  Nixon's 1972 visit, during which he met with late chairman 
Mao Zedong, opened the door to the establishment of full Sino-US 
diplomatic relations seven years later. Washington had 
previously refused to recognise the communist regime which came 
to power here in 1949, instead maintaining ties with the 
Nationalist government that had fled to Taiwan after losing the 
civil war on the mainland. Nixon has since maintained close 
contacts with China, visiting the country several times.
