  [Text] Kiev, 16 Mar -- Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk 
today received former U.S. President Richard Nixon who is on a 
private visit to Ukraine. A whole range of issues, touching 
upon the development of Ukrainian-U.S. relations, were discussed 
during the conversation. In particular, the possibilities and 
specific ways of attracting U.S. private capital in Ukraine's 
economy were discussed. Leonid Kravchuk informed the guest 
about the political and economic situation in Ukraine and about 
the progress of the reform. He pointed out that no matter what 
credits are granted by foreign countries, Ukraine's economy 
cannot be revived without solid investments. For its part, 
Ukraine will do everything possible to create the necessary 
conditions for the protection of investments, emphasized the 
president. Ukraine's legislation, too, serves this purpose. 
  Richard Nixon extended Leonid Kravchuk the best wishes from 
U.S. President Bill Clinton. He highly assessed the results of 
the recent visit by the president of Ukraine to the United 
States and the agreements achieved in the course of the visit. 
  The United States attributes great importance to relations 
with Ukraine and to the consolidation of its independence and 
regards it as a good partner in various spheres, emphasized 
Richard Nixon. I arrived in Ukraine to obtain, so to say, 
first-hand information about the situation in your country and 
to report on everything I saw and heard here to Bill Clinton 
upon my return to the United States. 
  Leonid Kravchuk asked Richard Nixon to give his best wishes 
to U.S. President Bill Clinton and declared that he recalls his 
visit to the United States and his meetings with the U.S. 
President with great pleasure.
