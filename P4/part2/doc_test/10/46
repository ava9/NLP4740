China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping today laughed about foreign reports of his 
death and said China is unafraid of Western sanctions in the wake of the June 
crushing of pro-democracy unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Deng, 85, also told Japanese lawmaker Masayoshi Ito that among the politicians 
he most respected were former President Richard M. Nixon, Henry A. Kissinger 
and Japan's former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. All three men led the way in 
improving their countries' relations with China. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting at the Great Hall of the People was the second for China's 
reclusive leader in three days. 
</P>
<P>
He appeared in public for the first time in three months Saturday when he held 
talks with Chinese-American physicist T. D. Lee. 
</P>
<P>
Deng's re-emergence after the long absence has, for the moment, dispelled 
speculation that he is gravely ill with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The nationally televised evening news showed Deng walking unaided to meet Ito, 
whom he called "an old friend" as the two shook hands. 
</P>
<P>
Deng told Ito that criticism of China by the Paris summit of seven 
non-communist industrialized nations in July was "based on lies and 
distortions" and "too superficial." 
</P>
<P>
"China is not afraid of sanctions, which will rebound on those imposing them in 
the long run," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deng added that China had noticed "some difference" in attitude between Japan 
and the other six countries. 
</P>
<P>
Japan joined Western nations in condemning Beijing's killing of demonstrators 
and an ensuing wave of arrests in June, but its criticism was less harsh. Tokyo 
put a freeze on new financial aid to China.
