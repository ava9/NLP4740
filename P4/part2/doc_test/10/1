<P>
Former President Richard M. Nixon is going to China to meet with government 
leaders late this month on a visit delayed because of the deadly crackdown on 
pro-democracy demonstrators last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's spokesman, John H. Taylor, said the former President's meetings with 
officials in Beijing will begin around Oct. 30. For security reasons, Taylor 
said, his precise travel plans were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said Nixon had discussed his plans with President Bush and with Brent 
Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser. "He will give his 
assessment of the leaders, their policies and Chinese-American relations in 
general in writing to President Bush upon his return," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
The trip will be Nixon's sixth to China since, before resigning the presidency 
in disgrace, he reopened U.S. relations with mainland China in 1972. Taylor 
described it as "solely a fact-finding trip" with no sightseeing or social 
events. He said Nixon will be paying his own expenses and those of the one 
security aide who will travel with him.
