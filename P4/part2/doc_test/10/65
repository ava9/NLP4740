  [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia (LDPR) leader, told Interfax that the Russian 
president had been right in refusing to meet former U.S. 
President Richard Nixon. 
  In Zhirinovskiy's view, by meeting opposition leaders and 
former vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy, "who did not represent 
anybody," before sitting with the president, Nixon was 
"discourteous to the head of state." Meeting Yeltsin was 
expected to be the highlight of Nixon's visit. 
  Zhirinovskiy was not sure whether he would meet with Nixon. 
He did not have an official word on this but knew that such a 
meeting was on Nixon's schedule. 
  Zhirinovskiy made it clear that his country "never assumed a 
posture" or refused contacts. He said that his party had been 
invited to a reception in the U.S. Embassy Thursday night on the 
occasion of Nixon's stay in Russia. Zhirinovskiy's deputy in 
the LDPR and Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Aleksandr 
Vengerovskiy would attend the reception.
