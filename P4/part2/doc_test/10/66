"Major Diplomatic Incident; This Is How American Press Assesses 
Russian Leaders' Refusal To Meet With Richard Nixon"] 
  [Excerpts] The American press is commenting on Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin's harsh statement that neither he, nor 
anyone around him, nor members of the Russian Government will be 
meeting with Richard Nixon, the 37th U.S. president, who is in 
Moscow. As many people know, such a decision was made in 
retaliation for Mr. Nixon's contacts that had taken place with 
prominent figures of the Russian opposition. [passage omitted] 
  In the meantime it is becoming clear that those close to the 
Russian president have different assessments of the harshness 
shown to the American visitor. 
  For example, Andranik Migranyan, member of the Russian 
Federation Presidential Council, does not see anything 
objectionable in the desire of an "aging" Nixon to get an 
objective idea of the political processes in Russia with the 
aid, among other things, of talking with representatives of the 
radical opposition in Moscow. 
  In this connection, Mr. Migranyan told an INTERFAX 
correspondent that "he is not quite clear" about the motives of 
Boris Yeltsin's refusal to receive Richard Nixon. "This is even 
less clear if there had been a previous agreement and promise 
from our side of having a meeting," he added. 
  Yeltsin's adviser thinks the trips by USSR President Mikhail 
Gorbachev to the United States, during which he freely 
communicated with officials and political groupings hostile to 
Bill Clinton, as an analogy are appropriate.
