FOR the first time a leading public opinion poll has found that President
George Bush could be beaten in November by the two Democratic party
front-runners, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Senator Paul
Tsongas of Massachusetts.
The poll also showed Mr Bush's overall approval rating dropping below 40 per
cent, among the lowest scores recorded by an incumbent at this point of a
presidency. Most of the erosion in his support came from registered
Republicans.
Also taking the edge off what should be a series of victories in the Super
Tuesday primaries held yesterday, Mr Bush found his administration on the
receiving end of a blast from former president Richard Nixon for its
'pathetically inadequate' response in assisting the former Soviet Union. Mr
Bush said he did not take Mr Nixon's criticisms 'personally'.
Several recent surveys have suggested Mr Bush could lose to an unnamed
Democrat, but have found him comfortably ahead when the opposition was
identified in person. The Washington Post/ABC News poll of 1,030 randomly
selected adults, conducted from March 4-8, put him behind Mr Clinton by 46
to 44 per cent and behind Mr Tsongas by a wider margin of 47 to 42 per cent,
both subject to a sampling error of plus or minus 4 per cent.
The poll is, of course, only a snapshot of sentiment at a time when Mr Bush
has been receiving generally poor political reviews for his campaign
performance. But it also indicates that both Mr Clinton and Mr Tsongas, the
main Super Tuesday Democratic rivals, are becoming much better known
nationally.
But the drop in the president's overall rating (39 per cent approving, 58
per cent not, against 46-49 per cent in the previous survey a month before)
invites comparisons with previous presidents seeking relection. In the
spring of 1948, Harry Truman was down to 36 per cent, but won in November;
in 1968 Lyndon Johnson scored only 41 per cent, and withdrew; in 1976 Gerald
Ford was at 50 per cent, and lost; while in 1980 Jimmy Carter was also at 39
per cent, and was defeated.
Mr Bush does not want particularly to be reminded of previous presidents at
present. Mr Ronald Reagan has been conspicuously unhelpful by not quashing
the uprising on the Republican right, while Mr Nixon's intervention
yesterday serves as a reminder of sharp divisions inside the foreign policy
establishment.
Arguing for much greater financial and humanitarian assistance for Russia,
Mr Nixon wrote: 'The hot button issue in the 1950s was 'who lost China?' If
Yeltsin goes down, the question 'who lost Russia?' will be an infinitely
more devastating issue in the 1990s.'
