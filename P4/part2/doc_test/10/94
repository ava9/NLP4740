Confrontation"] 
  [Text] Former president Richard Nixon has been accused of 
various things in the past, but not of being a foreign policy 
amateur. During his recent private visit to Moscow, the 
81-year-old proved once again he still has great knowledge of 
world politics. At the end of his visit he came to the 
conclusion that Russia will remain a great power whose interests 
will, however, not always be identical with those of the United 
States. 
  This realization may sound very simple, but it was far from 
obvious over the past few weeks: The Ames espionage affair and 
Moscow's latest diplomatic initiative in Bosnia and the Middle 
East almost recreated the image of the aggressive Russian bear 
as the United States' more or less natural opponent. It is, 
therefore, all the more surprising -- and encouraging -- that 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher has now come to the same 
conclusion as Richard Nixon: Following his meeting with his 
Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev, Christopher stated that 
differences between Moscow and Washington are quite natural. 
They just have to be solved as soon as they arise. 
  In Vladivostok, the Russians once again emphasized what is 
important to them. They want to be consulted, not taken by 
surprise by U.S. initiatives. This complaint contains the 
threat of starting their own initiatives that have not been 
agreed beforehand. This would mean a relapse into the Cold War. 
As long as Russia emphasizes its interest in a constructive 
partnership, it should be taken at its word.
