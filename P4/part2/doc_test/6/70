FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Moorfield Estates returns to black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Moorfield Estates returned to the black in the six months to June 30.
The USM-quoted property investment group announced pre-tax profits of Pounds
459,000, compared with losses of Pounds 244,000, on turnover up from Pounds
1.62m to Pounds 2.39m.
The improvement was mainly due to net rental income more than doubled at
Pounds 1.83m, against Pounds 746,000, while net interest charges rose 43 per
cent from Pounds 751,000 to Pounds 1.07m.
In April Moorfield raised Pounds 12.2m net of expenses, via a placing and
open offer, to help finance the Pounds 24m purchase of six properties. A
further Pounds 10m was borrowed which, with existing resources, completed
the acquisition.
Earnings per share were 1.01p (losses 2.23p). A dividend of 0.5p is
declared; the board said it intends to pay a similar amount for the full
year.
