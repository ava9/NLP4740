Embassy Property Group, the development company, yesterday announced a
complex restructuring together with an Pounds 8.7m UK acquisition and a
Pounds 3m Chinese investment.
Skillion, a light industrial property specialist, is being bought from TR
Property Investment Trust for Pounds 8.72m, of which Pounds 4.72m will be
settled in cash and the rest in shares. The deal will leave TR Property with
an 8.67 per cent stake in Embassy.
The proposed investment in China is a 47,850 sq m mixed use development
close to the centre of Beijing. Embassy is buying a 25 per cent stake from
Mr YP Tse, a Hong Kong businessman, in a part-paper deal which will leave Mr
Tse with a 9.2 per cent shareholding in Embassy.
Mr Tai Yu Wong, Embassy chairman, said the Skillion acquisition would
provide a strong asset base. The planned Beijing investment would be the
first of a number of opportunities in China and east Asia.
Some Pounds 15.2m is being raised from a placing and open offer of 1.6bn
ordinary shares at 1p each by Singer &amp; Friedlander. The company plans a
capital reorganisation, which will include the reduction in nominal value of
each existing ordinary share from 5p to 1p. It has applied to move from the
USM to the Official List.
Dealings in the new shares are expected to begin on March 31. The proposals
will increase the company's market capitalisation from Pounds 3.1m to about
Pounds 21.7m.
Embassy also announced yesterday a pre-tax loss of Pounds 454,000 for the
six months to September 30. In the previous first half it made Pounds 4m
before tax. Losses per share of 0.4p compared with earnings of 26p.
Mr Michael Kingshott, managing director of Skillion, and Mr Barry Russell, a
Skillion director, are joining the board.
