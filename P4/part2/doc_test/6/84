WEMBLEY, the leisure group which owns the London stadium, yesterday
announced a 1-for-1 rights issue to raise Pounds 37.3m, which will be used
to reduce borrowings.
Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman, said the cash call would cut gearing to 66 per
cent. Gearing would have been nearly 150 per cent at the end of 1991, when
he said the group took a conservative view of its assets in preparation for
the rights issue.
He now aimed to dispose of non-core businesses to reduce gearing to 55 per
cent.
The fully underwritten issue of up to 136.9m new shares was priced at 30p
each. Wembley's shares closed down 3 1/2 p at 33 1/2 p.
Wembley forecast it would make a pre-tax loss of up to Pounds 8.5m in the
year to December 31 1991, compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 13.2m in
the previous year.
The loss was mainly due to exceptional restructuring costs of Pounds 3.2m in
merging the group's US ticketing businesses and a writedown of Pounds 3.3m
on its investment in Leisure Resources Group.
There will be a loss per share of not more than 10p, compared with earnings
per share of 9.3p last time.
The directors forecast a final dividend of 0.9p (1.5p), giving a total for
the year of 1.8p against 2.4p.
The group said it had been badly affected by the Gulf war, which cut the
number of pop concerts at Wembley to three last year, compared with a normal
level of between eight and 12.
Delayed construction work at Wembley's exhibition hall also disrupted
business.
Wembley is to increase its stake in National Leisure Catering, a joint
venture with ARA, the private US food services group, from 50 per cent to 75
per cent.
The Pounds 3.25m consideration to ARA will be paid in the form of 6.8 per
cent of Wembley's enlarged share capital, which the US group has said it
regards as a strategic investment.
The UK leisure group is also issuing 18.6m new convertible preference shares
in exchange for all its outstanding convertible loan stock.
Sir Brian said he was confident that the Gulf-related difficulties of last
year would not recur, and Wembley would benefit from the reorganisation of
its US ticket business, the refurbishment of the group's bingo clubs and the
contribution from new exhibition halls.
The rights issue was underwritten by Schroders, with Smith New Court as
brokers.
