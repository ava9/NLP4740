losses

Lilley, the Glasgow-based construction company, has announced a number of
asset sales and a re-organisation of its property joint ventures following a
pre-tax loss last year.
The company has sold housing land in north-west England for Pounds 3.75m and
a 4.625 per cent stake in Hong Kong's second cross-harbour tunnel for Pounds
3.1m.
It is also selling its stake in three property developments to its joint
venture partner London and Edinburgh Trust, part of Sweden's SPP group. In
return, LET is selling its shares in two smaller developments to Lilley.
Lilley will be paid Pounds 18.2m as consideration for the LET transactions.
The proceeds will be used to reduce group borrowings.
The disposals follow the announcement of pre-tax losses of Pounds 5m for the
year to December 31, compared to profits of Pounds 14.1m, following heavy
losses in the housebuilding and property development division and an
exceptional charge of Pounds 12m to cover falls in land values.
Turnover increased to Pounds 340m (Pounds 323m) due to increased contracting
sales of Pounds 260.8m (Pounds 236.9m). The division's order book increased
to Pounds 186m at the end of March from Pounds 181m a year earlier.
However, operating profits from contracting increased only slightly to
Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 9.1m) due to margin pressure. Profits from specialist
contracting fell to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 4.9m) despite almost maintained
turnover.
Housing sales declined from 463 units to 356 units. Average sales prices
increased to Pounds 72,000 (Pounds 66,000) but margins were eroded by
incentive offers. The division incurred an operating loss of Pounds 200,000
(Pounds 3.3m profit). Housing and property development reported combined
losses after exceptionals of Pounds 15m (Pounds 3.13m profit).
Earnings fell to 3.53p (7.99p). The final dividend is cut to 1p to make an
uncovered total of 2p (2.5p).
Net borrowings at the year end totalled Pounds 30.2m (Pounds 31.1m), giving
a debt/equity ratio of 64.1 per cent. The unwinding of the LET joint
ventures only affects off-balance sheet borrowings, which will fall from
Pounds 46.6m to Pounds 23.6m at the year end.
There were losses attributable to shareholders of Pounds 4.77m (Pounds 4.09m
profit). Combined with the dividend charge, retained losses totalled Pounds
8.9m (Pounds 41,000 retained profit).
COMMENT
Lilley's decision to get back to basics by withdrawing from most of its
property development businesses may be welcomed by the market. But
unfortunately for the company, the benefit is entirely off balance sheet,
and the debt/equity ratio remains uncomfortable at over 60 per cent. With UK
construction output set to fall again this year, and with Lilley's
housebuilding activities too small to swing it round single-handed, this
year will be difficult. Forecast profits of Pounds 4.5m put the shares on
just under 12 times, suggesting they are fully valued.
