FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Restructured Dunton in the black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dunton Group, the USM-quoted company with interests in brickmaking,
engineering and property, returned to profit after a restructuring for the
11 months to April 30.
Restated pre-tax profit was Pounds 3.8m, compared with a loss of Pounds
4.94m for the previous 12 months. However, ignoring the effect of the
restructuring, the company returned a loss before interest and tax of Pounds
15,000 (Pounds 2.6m).
The restructuring involved a 1-for-3 rights issue which raised Pounds
760,000, the sale of various group companies and their debt, and a
rearrangement with Dunton's bankers. It left the company with net assets of
Pounds 601,000, compared with negative net assets of Pounds 4.02m at May 31
1993.
Mr David Williams, chairman, said the board planned a reduction of capital
to eliminate the profit and loss deficit, and also intended to apply for a
full listing.
Earnings per share were 7.7p (losses 8.9p).
