  [Abstract] Research done on optical mirrors made of 
nonconventional materials for telescopes and lasers is reviewed, 
the aim having been highest possible precision for optimizing 
the image quality and minimizing the beam divergence by limiting 
the diffraction. The scientific-technical research program 
included: 
  1. construction of physical and mathematical models for 
comprehensive design analysis; 
  2. development and evaluation of promising new materials; 
  3. theoretical and experimental study of internal sources of 
dimensional instability; 
  4. methods of forming diverse optical surfaces, including 
eccentric aspherical and higher-order aspherical ones, methods 
producing ultrasmooth surfaces, and methods of joining mirrors 
to support structures; 
  5. development and deposition of reflective and protective 
coatings; 
  6. means and methods of continuous inspection throughout the 
manufacturing and testing cycle. 
  The only way to maximize the thermal stability of mirrors 
made of conventional materials is to minimize their coefficient 
_a_ of linear thermal expansion. The three conventional new 
mirror materials ULE doped-fused quartz (developed in the 
U.S.A.), Cerodur (developed in Germany), and Sitall 
glass-ceramic (developed in Russia) are inadequate in this 
respect, because they remain stable only within narrow 
temperature ranges. Considering, however, that the thermal 
strain under quasi-steady (slowly varying) conditions is 
determined also by the thermal conductivity _l_ of the material 
(namely the _a_/_l_ ratio), metallic materials (beryllium, 
aluminum alloys, copper alloys) and nonmetallic ones (Si, SiC) 
have been added to the list, especially since their critical 
mechanical properties are either superior (modulus of elasticity 
E) or comparable (E/k ratio, k- stiffness coefficient). Also 
composite materials are considered, mirrors made of the SiC-Si 
composite material combining light weight with high stiffness. A 
new technology has been developed for manufacturing mirrors with 
a structural-grade glass coating on a metal substrate, the 
expansion coefficients of the two materials necessarily 
matching. The technology ensures that the glass coating is 
sufficiently hard and chemically stable, that its softening 
temperature is sufficiently high and no crystallization occurs, 
and that the adhesion of glass to metal is sufficiently strong. 
The technology includes deposition of 3-5 mm thick glass plates 
on the metal surface, followed by a heating-soaking-cooling 
process according to a specific temperature-time cycle. Such 
mirrors up to 1200 mm in diameter have already been built and 
withstood temperatures down to -60ÎC without fracture of the 
coating. Special polishing and diamond grinding processes have 
been developed which reduces the roughness of metal surfaces to 
within 2-3 nm and 4-5 nm respectively, as measured with a 
contact profilometer or on the basis of integral light 
scattering. Also other reflective and protective coatings have 
also been developed: a multilayer dielectric on metal mirrors 
for 0.308 Êm or 1.064 Êm radiation, and metal-dielectric 
ones on mirrors for 5.1 Êm or 10.6 Êm radiation. Another 
aim 
is reducing the weight of large mirrors, the first generation of 
light-weight mirrors with glass on beryllium up to 1200 mm in 
diameter having been built in 1985. These mirrors have an 
asphericity not exceeding 180 Êm and a mean-square form 
deviation in 0.63 Êm light not exceeding 0.02 (plane and 
sphere) and 0.1 (higher- order asphericity). Their relative 
aperture is 1:5 and their reflection coefficient is 0.92 for 
visible light, 0.96 for near-infrared light, 0.93 for 
far-infrared light. For cryogenic telescopes used in astronomy 
are considered highly isotropic and technological low-cost 
mirrors made of aluminum alloys with protective coatings which 
can be cleaned by conventional methods. For optical cavities of 
technological lasers are being developed mirrors up to 1000 mm 
in diameter with reflective and protective coatings on 
ultrasmooth surfaces, suitable for both continuous-wave and 
pulse-repetition modes of operation at power levels up to 200 
kW, multilayer compound mirrors with cooling as well as 
monolithic mirrors without cooling. Tables 3; references 2.
