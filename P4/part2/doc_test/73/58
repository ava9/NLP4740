The $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope, NASA's most valuable payload, will be 
exposed to minimal contamination inside Discovery while it awaits a second 
launch attempt, the agency said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've kept this vehicle extremely clean," said Fred Wojtalik, a NASA project 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly more dust is expected to settle on the telescope's 94-inch mirror, the 
finest ever made, Wojtalik said. But the additional debris still will be well 
within contamination limits. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done all the cautionary things that we can," he said. "We're going to 
get some degradation. Some particles are going to come into the Hubble that we 
just can't avoid." 
</P>
<P>
Once the telescope reaches orbit, scientists want no more than 5% of the 
surface of Hubble's 94-inch mirror covered with dust or other debris, Wojtalik 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A 2% rate of contamination was expected had Discovery been launched on time 
Tuesday, Wojtalik said. That is expected to rise to 2.1% as a result of the 
delay until the new launch date, April 25. 
</P>
<P>
Clean air was being circulated inside Discovery's sealed payload bay Friday to 
reduce contamination of the telescope. NASA planned to open the payload bay 
Saturday so the telescope's nickel-hydrogen batteries can be removed and taken 
to a Kennedy Space Center laboratory for recharging. 
</P>
<P>
A protective cover will not be placed over the telescope's aperture door 
because the procedure is difficult and might result in even more contamination 
or damage, Wojtalik said. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery's launch was postponed four minutes before liftoff Tuesday when one 
of the shuttle's three auxiliary power units failed. Technicians will replace 
the unit with a new one this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time NASA has ever replaced an auxiliary power unit at the 
launch pad. As a result, the space agency has told technicians to take their 
time and that "there is no schedule pressure there." 
</P>
<P>
Hubble is to orbit 380 miles high, studying stars and galaxies so distant that 
their light has been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years. Scientists 
believe the universe was created about 15 billion years ago.
