NASA on Sunday installed a new power unit in the space shuttle Discovery and 
began recharging the batteries of the Hubble Space Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery is scheduled to lift off with the $1.5-billion telescope on April 25. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now everything seems to be in the bag for a week from Wednesday," said 
George Diller, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Technicians on Saturday took out a faulty auxiliary power unit that forced a 
scrub of Discovery's launching last Tuesday. A new unit was then installed, the 
first time the procedure has been performed at the launching pad. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery's payload bay doors were opened on Saturday and Hubble's six 
nickel-hydrogen batteries were removed for a 130-hour recharging that began 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
NASA decided to take the batteries to the laboratory because they can be 
recharged at a cooler temperature than at the launch pad, and thus retain more 
power. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle's three auxiliary power units pressurize the hydraulic system used 
to move wing and rudder surfaces and in the ship's braking and steering system. 
</P>
<P>
Technicians closed Discovery's payload bay doors Sunday after the batteries 
were removed. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber will remain sealed to reduce the risk of getting dust on the 
telescope's mirror until the batteries are reinstalled Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Once in orbit, the telescope named for American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble will 
enable astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant that their light has 
been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years.
