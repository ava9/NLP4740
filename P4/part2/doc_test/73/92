ENVIRONMENT: STUDY OF IMPACT ON ENDANGERED RED SQUIRREL IS HELD NOT NECESSARY 
FOR ARIZONA PROJECT. CONSERVATIONISTS WILL FIGHT THE RULING.

In a move sure to spark a challenge from environmentalists, the U.S. Forest 
Service on Thursday cleared the way for the construction of three telescopes on 
an Arizona mountaintop occupied by an endangered red squirrel. 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy review, the Justice Department told Forest Service officials 
that they could issue a permit for the astronomical observatory without 
requiring further study of its threat to the imperiled Mt. Graham red squirrel. 
</P>
<P>
George H. Leonard, associate chief of the Forest Service, pledged that his 
agency "will carefully monitor and report on the squirrel population" during 
the construction of the telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said that the project will be shut down and re-evaluated if it 
results in harm to more than six squirrels in a single year. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Arizona, which has sought to build its $200-million Mt. 
Graham International Observatory since 1984, heralded the decision and said 
work to clear the site for the first telescope could begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
"The astronomers are anxious to get started," university spokesman Steve 
Emerine said. "They've been waiting a long, long time." 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the news from conservationists and other foes, however, suggested 
that they may have to wait still longer. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be in court in the morning," warned Robin Silver, a Phoenix Audubon 
Society leader. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider this action a breach of public trust," Duane L. Shroufe, director 
of the Arizona Game and Fish Department, added in a statement. "How scientists 
who purport to be reaching for the stars can have so little foresight about 
what is beneath their feet is beyond belief." 
</P>
<P>
The Mt. Graham red squirrel, once abundant in the forests that cap the 
10,700-foot mountain south of Tucson, has declined precipitately in recent 
years, mostly because of piecemeal losses of habitat. 
</P>
<P>
The shy half-pound animal was added to the nation's list of endangered species 
in 1987. The species, found only on Mt. Graham, now numbers as few as 132. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the listing, the university -- aided by such prestigious partners as 
the Vatican and the Smithsonian Institution -- pressed forward with its 
project, which includes one instrument billed as the world's most powerful 
land-based telescope. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists concluded that squirrels 
and astronomy could coexist on Mt. Graham. But later, in depositions prepared 
as part of a lawsuit seeking to block the telescopes, those same biologists 
disclosed that they had been ordered by superiors to prepare documents that 
supported the project. 
</P>
<P>
That disclosure sparked a flurry of events ending with the formation of a 
blue-ribbon panel of federal scientists to study the issue. Their report, 
released earlier this month, concluded that a fresh assessment of the 
observatory's threat to the squirrel was warranted. 
</P>
<P>
But the Justice Department disagreed. A statement released by the Forest 
Service said Administration attorneys believe a 1988 law that exempted the 
telescopes from certain environmental reviews made additional study of the 
project's impacts unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
The tug of war over Mt. Graham represents one of the nastiest environmental 
battles in Arizona history. The squirrel became a national issue in May after 
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., in a comment that touched off a storm of 
protest, said: "Nobody's told me the difference between a red squirrel, a black 
one or a brown one. Do we have to save every subspecies?"
