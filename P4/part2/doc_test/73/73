"I'm going to get a motor car. I'm going to learn how to drive," said Bruce 
Quinn, who is 32 and legally blind. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, who by next summer expects to be running two radio stations 50 miles 
apart in northern Indiana, may be licensed to drive for the first time, thanks 
to eyeglasses equipped with small telescopes for making out details such as 
road signs and stoplights. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited about it. I got a moped a few years ago, and I've had a lot of fun 
with it and never any trouble, so I should be all right," Quinn, of Delphi, 
said. "It offers me a lot of opportunities -- something called freedom. Goodby 
to Greyhound. A lot of handicapped people are stuck on Greyhound." 
</P>

California and Texas have been licensing bioptic drivers for more than 10 
years, and about 25 states have such programs for as many as 2,000 drivers 
nationwide, said Warren Brown, Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles director of 
licensing. 
</P>
<P>
Brown developed Indiana's bioptic registration program at the urging of a 
vocational rehabilitation counselor and with help from low-vision optometrists. 
</P>

Enthusiastic State Help 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was the greatest idea in the world when I heard it. It's nice to 
do a little good for someone," he said. "You wouldn't believe how sad it is to 
tell a man he cannot drive again. I've had men cry. Driving is probably the 
single most important thing in any man's life." 
</P>
<P>
Optometrist Paul Bither, who helped write Indiana's licensing guidelines, said 
not everyone fits the program. Getting a license to drive is "a major step 
toward independence," but "it's not something that I push," he said. "Driving 
is a great privilege, but it's also a great responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
In Indiana, drivers must have vision correctable to 20-200 with glasses and to 
20-40 through telescopes with up to 4X magnification, a horizontal visual field 
of 130 degrees and no major blind spots, color-perception defects or other 
visual problems. They must be evaluated and fitted for the telescopes, get a 
six-month learner's permit and pass special state-sponsored training as well as 
the usual road test. 
</P>
<P>
The telescopes cost from $500 to more than $2,000. They vary in size and 
weight, but the most commonly used ones are about one inch in diameter and 
weigh about 6 ounces. They may extend a few inches at a slight angle upward 
from the top of the glasses over the user's strongest eye, in some cases both 
eyes. When the driver needs to see something he tilts his head forward to peer 
through the scope. 
</P>

<P>
Driving Range Limited 
</P>
<P>
"Most bioptic drivers, especially the older ones, tend to drive only in 
familiar areas," optometrist Dr. Debra McConnaha of Indiana University said. 
"It's possible they might be able to drive to the grocery and back without 
using the telescope. It's there if they need it." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the program say a bioptic driver must be able to glance through 
the telescope and spot something in less than a second -- about as quickly as a 
normal driver might glance into the rear-view mirror -- but critics say this is 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gerald Fonda, a Livingston, N. J., ophthalmologist who's been prescribing 
bioptic glasses since 1947, said bioptic drivers need at least three seconds to 
adjust their focus to the telescope, spot the detail and then readjust to 
looking through their glasses. He said the telescope creates a blind spot that 
is twice as wide as the field of vision through it. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the telescope is to pass the driver's test. There's no evidence 
this device is safe, and there is overwhelming evidence it is a hazard," Fonda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Arthur H. Keeney, professor of ophthalmology at the University of 
Louisville Medical School, said the telescope makes objects appear to be closer 
than they are and that its "awning effect" obscures overhead signs. He and 
Fonda say that poor-vision people should be allowed to drive, but under 
restrictive conditions such as under 35 m.p.h. only and never on freeways. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Telescopes Criticized 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of ways to help people without encumbering them with an optical 
device that imposes limitations," Keeney said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Gengler of the California Department of Motor Vehicles said that a 1983 
study of the state's bioptic drivers found that they were nearly twice as 
likely to have accidents as others. 
</P>
<P>
"The accident rate was higher, but not significantly. In fact, it was lower 
than rates for a variety of other types of California licensed drivers with 
different medical conditions," Gengler said. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates for bioptic drivers say they are among the most careful people on the 
road. Bioptics say they know their limitations and won't exceed them. 
</P>
<P>
"We stress the safe-driving aspect as part of the privileges we get as 
drivers," said Marc Sessions, president of the 1,000-member American Bioptic 
Certified Drivers, based in Laguna Niguel, Calif. (He said the group's 
initials, ABCD, also stand for Always Be Careful Driving.) 
</P>
<P>
Teresa Canada, 34, of Jasonville, started driving at 16 but lost her license 
eight years ago because of poor eyesight. "I have to be more careful than 
others. If I feel I am not capable, I am not going to be on the roads," said 
Canada, driving through downtown Indianapolis after her road test in October. 
</P>
<P>
Until she got a bioptic license, Canada had to call her husband at work if an 
emergency came up at home with any of their four children. "It's been eight 
years since I've been able to drive, so I've been in a kind of a prison."
