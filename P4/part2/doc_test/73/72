 of the African violet family (Gesneriaceae) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a shrubby tree usually 10 to 20 ft (3 to 6 m) tall. The opposite, stalked, papery-textured, toothed leaves are usually
2.4 to 4.7 in (6 to 12 cm) long and 1 to 1.8 in (2.5 to 4.6 cm) wide and have a few tiny, coarse hairs on the upper surface. Clusters
of three to five flowers have a moderate amount of short brown hairs throughout the cluster, a main stalk 1 to 1.4 in (2.5
to 3.5 cm) long, two linear bracts about 0.25 in (6 to 7 mm) long, and individual flower stalks 0.6 to 1.2 in (1.5 to 3 cm)
long. The calyx, 0.1 to 0.4 in (3 to 9 mm) long, has an outer covering of short, soft brown hairs and is divided into five
narrowly triangular lobes. The corolla consists of five fused white petals about 0.5 in (12 mm) long, with lobes about
0.08 to 0.1 in (2 to 3 mm) long. Only immature berries have been observed, and they were white and about 0.4 in (1 cm) long.

 are distinguished from others of the genus and others on the island of Hawaii by a combination of the following characteristics:
The opposite, more or less elliptic, papery leaves; the presence of some hairs on the leaves and more on

the inflorescences; the presence of three to six flowers per inflorescence; and the size and shape of the flowers and
flower parts (Wagner

 was found on the island of Hawaii on the northeastern slope of Mauna Kea near Kilau Stream and south to the eastern slope
of Mauna Loa near Kilauea Crater. The 3 extant populations on State-owned land are located near Kilau Stream, Stainback
Highway, and Puu Makaala, extending over a distance of approximately 31 by 3 mi (50 by 5 km) and containing a total of
about 14 to 20 plants (HHP 1991j1 to 1991j5; W. Wagner, pers. comm., 1992). This species typically grows in shady koa-,
'ohi'a-, and tree fern-dominated Montane Wet Forests at elevations between 2,400 and 4,900 ft (720 and 1,500 m) (HHP

Cyrtandra tintinnabula

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the African violet family is a shrub 3.3 to 6.6 ft (1 to 2 m) tall with opposite, stalked, elliptical or oval, papery-textured
leaves 5 to 10 in (13 to 26 cm) long and 2 to 4.8 in (5 to 12.3 cm) wide. Leaves, especially the lower surfaces, have yellowish-brown
hairs. Flower clusters, densely covered with long soft hairs, comprise three to six flowers, a main stalk 0.4 to 0.7
in (1 to 1.8 cm) long, individual flower stalks 0.2 to 0.6 in (0.5 to 1.5 cm) long, and leaflike bracts. The green bell-shaped
calyx is about 0.4 in (9 to 10 mm) long and has triangular lobes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hairy white corolla, about 0.5 in (12 mm) long and about 0.2 in (5 mm) in diameter, is divided into five lobes, each
about 0.1 in (3 mm) long. Fruit and seeds have not been observed. This species differs from
