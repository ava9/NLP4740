<TEXT>
<P>
With Arthur Coladarci wielding his pen as academic secretary, the minutes from 
the 21st Senate of the Academic Council at Stanford University no longer 
consist of coma-inducing verbiage. 
</P>
<P>
Coladarci expunges dull minutes that begin "The meeting was called to order by 
. . . " Rather, he lifts the job of taking minutes to a new literary and 
comical plane. 
</P>
<P>
To wit: "(Chairman John) Kaplan rapped his gavel smartly at approximately 3:20 
p.m., and all but an impish chemist responded appropriately -- but he complied 
cheerfully with Kaplan's personalized invitation to join the otherwise 
respectful assembly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decided to Inject Fun 
</P>
<P>
Coladarci, 71, a professor emeritus of psychology and education, said that when 
he began writing the minutes last fall, he set out to inject some fun into the 
official record of a body that decides a variety of academic issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never been comfortable with the general assumption that minutes ought 
to be sober things," Coladarci said. "Meetings are not only sober occasions. 
People are people and even the most serious discussions have in them a little 
irony, a little humor." 
</P>
<P>
He said he's heard only compliments about his writing. 
</P>
<P>
He does have detractors, however, who nevertheless insist on remaining 
anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are flippant," one professor said. "Not that we have to take 
ourselves all that seriously . . . there's a great deal of his own 
editorializing about matters. A person who takes notes should maintain some 
distance." 
</P>
<P>
Coladarci also has supporters, such as university President Donald Kennedy, who 
called the minutes "wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose he tickles somebody the wrong way," Kennedy said. "The literary 
quality is very high, and he keeps high morale in the staff and Senate." 
</P>
<P>
Another longtime Coladarci supporter is Nel Noddings, a professor of education. 
</P>
<P>
"He did minutes for us at the school of education and they were even more fun," 
she said. "He was less restrained. The minutes were always read." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
They Were Always Read 
</P>
<P>
She noted that when Coladarci asks for additions, faculty members usually have 
suggestions, proving that the minutes are being read. 
</P>
<P>
Witness this paragraph from the Dec. 1 minutes: "The Senate tacitly gave its 
secular absolution to the academic secretary for the venial misspelling of 
'tendentious' in the draft version of the Nov. 10 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
When Coladarci was appointed academic secretary, he agreed to serve for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good arrangement for people in my age bracket," he said. "Otherwise, 
administrators are put in the uncomfortable position of telling someone he's 
decrepit." 
</P>
<P>
Excerpts from Coladarci's minutes: 
</P>
<P>
* "Confessing an ignorance probably held by many, Rebholz inquired about the 
meaning of the acronym 'pro fro' in the C-UAFA report. His intellectual hunger 
was sated by (Dean Jean) Fetter's response: 'prospective freshmen,' but it was 
re-generated and re-satisfied by her comment that the committee employs, but 
mercifully omitted from the report, an even more arcane acronym, 'Pro Fro Ho 
Pro,' which signals 'Prospective Freshman Host Programs.' Rebholz smiled in 
admiration and then retreated. Fetter, however, continued to advance 
mercilessly with an explanation of that operation in which she alchemized the 
acronym noun into an ear-catching and dangerously suggestive verb; e.g., 'We go 
Pro Fro-ing around the country.' " 
</P>
<P>
* "P.S. The reward for those who read to the end is a bit of intelligence about 
our theory-constructing and theory-driven Department of Sociology. The 1895-96 
catalogue includes the following course: Sociology 10. Principles of Household 
Management, 2 Hours, 2d semester. Lectures and assigned readings on domestic 
architecture, house decoration and furnishing, sanitation, food and dietaries, 
domestic labor, and household finance.
