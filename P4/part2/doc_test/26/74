THE GORBACHEVS IN CALIFORNIA;

<P>
GORBACHEV AT STANFORD: CALIFORNIA IS 'SPECIAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here is a partial text of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's address at 
Stanford University: 
</P>
<P>
Ladies and gentleman, I'm very pleased that within the framework of my state 
visit to the United States, I am here among you within the walls of (this) 
world-famous university. Thank you for your warm hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
I think that those who work or study in your university are doubly lucky it is 
in California. . . . California is a special place, even by international 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
And I'm saying this not just by way of a compliment and to say pleasant things 
to the governor of this state, who is here with his wife. I think I am just 
stating a fact. It is said that only five countries in the world produce a 
greater gross output than your state. The ideas and technologies of tomorrow 
are born here in California. California is closely linked economically with 
Europe, Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Role of the U.N. 
</P>
<P>
So, this is a good place to live and for me an appropriate place for discussing 
how the Soviet Union and the United States have positioned themselves on the 
dividing line between the centuries and the eras on the coasts of the Pacific . 
. . described as the Mediterranean of the future. It is appropriate now to 
ponder the destinies of the world, since it was here in San Francisco the 
United Nations was founded precisely 45 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
I think this is symbolic, that it is this sunny city that was selected as the 
place . . . to . . . proclaim the foundation, the establishment of this 
organization whose efficiency we all need very much. 
</P>
<P>
Let us look at the conclusions drawn that time, right after the horrible war. 
The United Nations was set up to . . . remove the political, economic and 
social causes of war . . . to promote relations among nations . . . on the 
equal rights and self-determination of peoples, with respect for human rights. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
It is only now that international politics is really starting to adjust itself 
to these ideologies and principles, and all of us felt how much we need the 
United Nations if we really are to move the world. . . . For a long time, the 
Pacific was a center of confrontations and the arms race. . . . Nations found 
themselves on the opposite sides of the barricades of ancient revolutions. But 
new winds are now blowing. . . . The Japanese and Koreans and Chinese and other 
Asian peoples have lessons for the entire world to learn. . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
After the Cold War 
</P>
<P>
Let us think about the future. . . . I am under no illusions regarding the 
possibility of faster convergence (of) societies . . . They probably will never 
be fully alike. There is no need for that. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Cold War is now behind us. Let us not wrangle over who won it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when military procurement orders were considered -- are still 
considered by some -- to be the best incentive for economic and technological 
progress. . . . (In the 1970s) Santa Clara County, which was first in 
per-capita military contracts, began to explore ways of demilitarizing the 
local economy. I hope that as Soviet-American relations improve . . . 
participation in the arms race will become a thing of the past . . . not only 
for your beautiful state but both our great powers. 
</P>
<P>
Science has played a major role in the arms race. Science was the first to seek 
out . . . and to look for a way out. . . . Here we have to give credit to the 
joint efforts of Soviet and American scientists, to which Stanford University 
scientists have made a very substantial contribution in their program for the 
development of the basic principles for such concepts as international security 
and strategic stability. 
</P>
<P>
Without a . . . similar and objective approach to defining strategic stability 
and national security, without a scientific analysis taking into account all 
factors -- economic, political, scientific, military, technical and 
political-military -- it is impossible to make the right decisions on . . . 
nuclear and conventional arms reductions. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists of our two countries worked together to make the necessary 
estimates and discussed them over and over again. They . . . put aside the 
political and military ambitions which had long stood in the way of a solution. 
Thus they have arrived at major political decisions, including those adopted 
over these days in Washington. . . .
