<TEXT>
Cantab Pharmaceuticals, the biotechnology company, has signed an agreement
with California's Stanford University that gives it an option to acquire
exclusive rights to a family of patent applications covering inventions by
Stanford's researchers.
The two will also collaborate on research into autoimmune and inflammatory
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis.
The deal signals Cantab's entry into autoimmune and inflammatory disease
areas.
The work is still at the research stage. Any product it isolated would have
to go through years of clinical trials before reaching the market.
