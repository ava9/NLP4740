As computer companies strive to develop virtual reality systems, researchers
in California are working on technologies that allow people to tap into the
virtual (or sub-conscious) reality inside their heads - namely, dreams.
The Lucidity Institute, a private organisation founded in 1988 by Stephen
LaBerge, a Stanford University researcher, has developed computer-based
electronic devices and training programmes that teach people how to
experience lucid dreams. In these, the dreamers are aware of their dreams;
they can participate consciously in them and control them for specific
objectives.
The methods developed by the institute promise users such possibilities as
indulging in adventures and fantasies, refining skills, finding solutions to
difficult problems, overcoming nightmares and discovering methods of
healing.
Executives have used lucid dreams to rehearse difficult presentations,
surgeons have practised complex procedures, and classical musicians have
rehearsed difficult passages. In most cases, the skills perfected in the
lucid dream have been transferred to the waking state.
There are also important therapeutic applications. Physically handicapped
persons can regain total mobility within the lucid dream state, and there
are some indications that lucid dreams can help boost the body's immune
response and increase the rate of healing.
As yet, though, evidence of lucid dreams' impact is anecdotal. Some
researchers are sceptical about their value. Also, some psychotherapists who
use dreams to treat neuroses are unhappy about lucid dreams, regarding them
as an interference with the sub-conscious.
Lucid dreams certainly offer a more effective virtual reality than is
achieved by computer systems. In computer-based virtual reality, the user
interacts with a computer-generated world by wearing goggles containing tiny
computer screens and a special electronic glove that detects hand movements.
Such systems have a long way to go in mimicking waking reality; the computer
graphics resolution is poor and the systems are slow and very expensive. But
in the virtual reality of dreams, the dreamer experiences a world almost
indistinguishable from waking reality. While lucid dreams sometimes happen
spontaneously, they are fairly rare for most people. This is why researchers
at the institute concentrate on developing electronic biofeedback devices
and programmes that help people achieve lucid dreams on a regular basis.
The most sophisticated device is called the DreamLight. This is a small
computer about the size of a hardback book with a one-line liquid crystal
display and four control buttons. It is attached via a wire to a lightweight
sleep mask worn by the user. Sensors in the mask detect body and eye
movements and contain two tiny lights. When the DreamLight detects rapid eye
movements and no body movements, it knows that the user is dreaming. It will
then flash the lights in the sleep mask in a specific sequence.
In the dream, the DreamLight user sees the flashing lights incorporated in
some way, such as the sun rising and setting, or car headlights flashing.
The flashing lights act as a signal to the dreamer that he or she is
experiencing a dream. By maintaining a balance between staying within the
dream and not waking, the dreamer can experience a lucid dream lasting up to
45 minutes or more.
LaBerge is also a co-founder of the Stanford University Sleep Research
Center, one of the few large research centres into sleep and dreams. LaBerge
He and his colleagues began developing the DreamLight technology in 1985.
'The first prototype looked more like a prop in a bad 1950s science fiction
film,' says LaBerge. But despite its crude nature, experiments showed that
it worked well.
The institute further refined this technology and now offers not only the
Dollars 1,200 (Pounds 822) DreamLight but also a less expensive version, the
Dollars 275 NovaDreamer.
'The NovaDreamer has the potential to reach a very large market and help
introduce large numbers of people to lucid dreaming,' says Craig Webb, one
of the NovaDreamer developers.
Webb adds that the institute is looking for investors and distributors to
help market its technology to the large potential market. It says the
technology has widespread applications - the storage capacity, up to 10
days, of a subject's dream cycles can help diagnose and treat sleep
disorders without requiring lengthy and expensive visits to sleep
laboratories. The institute claims it can also be programmed to sound an
alarm during or before a dream - useful in treating people with recurring
nightmares.
