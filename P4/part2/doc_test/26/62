Dead Barred From Maryland: A concert pavilion in Columbia, Md., is the latest 
to ban concerts by the Grateful Dead because of its fans. The 14,000-seat 
Merriweather Post Pavilion granted a police request to end scheduling of 
concerts by the veteran rock 'n' roll band and the Jerry Garcia Band, headed by 
the Grateful Dead's lead guitarist, said Jean Parker, general manager of the 
14,000-seat amphitheater. Several other venues, including Stanford University 
and the University of California at Berkeley, had banned the group in April 
because of recurring drug-related arrests at concerts. GREG BRAXTON

Not banned -- A Thursday Morning Report item inaccurately reported that the 
Grateful Dead had been banned from Stanford University and the University of 
California at Berkeley. In fact, the band and officials at those institutions 
mutually agreed that the band's popularity was drawing larger crowds than could 
be accommodated by the colleges.
