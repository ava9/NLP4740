LEADING HEART SURGEON TO JOIN STAFF AT UCSD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Internationally acclaimed heart surgeon Stuart W. Jamieson will join the staff 
at UC San Diego Medical Center, a move that promises to vault the Hillcrest 
hospital to the forefront of heart and lung transplant research and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Jamieson, 42, has accepted the position of professor of surgery and chief of 
the division of cardiothoracic surgery at the UCSD, Dr. Gerard N. Burrow, the 
dean of UCSD's medical school, announced Thursday. Final academic committee 
approval of Jamieson's appointment is expected within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
Jamieson has performed about 500 heart transplants and more than 50 heart-lung 
transplants -- a relatively new procedure first attempted only eight years ago. 
Jamieson, who trained with renowned heart surgeon Dr. Norman Shumway, claims a 
higher-than-average survival rate among his patients. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Jamieson is without question one of the leading cardiothoracic surgeons 
practicing today," Burrow said. "Under (his) leadership, the UCSD School of 
</P>
<P>
Medicine's division of cardiothoracic surgery will become one of the premier 
teaching and research programs in the country, and San Diego will become a 
national center for these specialized surgical procedures." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Stringer, director of UCSD's Medical Center, said the recruitment 
of Jamieson "sends one more signal that this region is a biomedical center of 
national importance." 
</P>
<P>
Jamieson, who is now at the University of Minnesota, plans to move to San Diego 
with his team of transplant surgeons and nurses by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Becoming a Magnet 
</P>
<P>
In addition, two agencies closely connected to the developing body of research 
in heart-lung transplants will relocate to San Diego to follow the 
accomplishments of Jamieson and his team. The International Registry for Heart 
Transplantation, which keeps records on heart and heart-lung transplants 
throughout the world, and the editorial offices of the bimonthly Journal of 
Heart Transplantation will move their offices here, according to officials at 
UCSD Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
For all of Jamieson's rave reviews, he has known controversy. A UCSD 
spokeswoman said he recently resigned after two years as the head of the 
University of Minnesota's highly successful cardiothoracic surgery program 
after several months of turmoil over administrative and personnel matters. He 
remained on the medical school faculty. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD Medical Center officials, however, do not seem to be worried about 
Jamieson's past problems, which were apparently the product of personality 
conflicts with some of the staff at the University of Minnesota, according to 
UCSD Medical Center spokeswoman Leslie Franz. "At no point was there a question 
over his capabilities as a surgeon or the success of his program," Franz said. 
</P>
<P>
There was "a great deal of discussion" among the administrators at UCSD Medical 
Center re 
</P>
<P>
garding Jamieson's turmoil-filled tenure at the University of Minnesota, Franz 
said, but no objections were raised to extending an invitation to Jamieson to 
come west. 
</P>
<P>
"The administration felt very comfortable that these were all very 
institutionally specific kinds of agreements and would not really have any 
impact on Dr. Jamieson's ability to do the job here," Franz said. 
</P>
<P>
"All surgeons somehow are controversial figures . . . and I think Dr. Jamieson 
is no exception," Burrow said. The academic program for heart surgery in 
Minnesota was "virtually nonexistent" at the time of Jamieson's arrival, he 
said. "Jamieson built the program from nothing, and he did it very quickly. 
It's hard to do that and not step on some people's toes, and I think that he 
simply stepped on too many toes, and I think he's aware of that. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked into this very carefully, and everyone we talked to has said he 
really is a brilliant surgeon." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looked at Jamieson 3 Months Ago 
</P>
<P>
Burrow said the administration decided within the past year to establish a 
major cardiovascular disease program and began specifically looking at the 
possibility of recruiting Jamieson about three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD Medical Center now operates the only kidney transplant center in San Diego 
County and plans to develop a pancreatic transplant program. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our key missions here is teaching and training, and in order to do it 
to our full capability, it's important that our department of surgery have a 
comprehensive transplant program," Franz said. "It's important to not only have 
a program like this so that young surgeons can be trained to do these 
procedures, but also a program where research is being done and the procedures 
can be perfected." 
</P>
<P>
Jamieson, born in Rhodesia and educated in London, took a fellowship at 
Stanford University in 1978 and helped develop the fledgling field of 
heart-lung transplantation along with pre-eminent heart surgeon Norman Shumway. 
In 1982, he was appointed director of Stanford's Heart-Lung Transplantation 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Jamieson took over as head of the University of Minnesota's heart 
surgery program, which quadrupled its surgical activity during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's heart surgery program has been directed for the past few years by Dr. 
Pat Daily, who is also head of the heart surgery program at Sharp Memorial 
Hospital. Daily will continue to work for Sharp Memorial Hospital and will 
remain on the clinical faculty at UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp Memorial is the only hospital in San Diego where heart transplants are 
performed. No lung transplants have ever been performed in San Diego County.
