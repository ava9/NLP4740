UCI'S BECKMAN INSTITUTE, USC TEAM UP ON LASER PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Beckman Laser Institute, a private medical research organization closely 
affiliated with UC Irvine, has entered into partnership with the University of 
Southern California to compete for a $15-million federal grant to develop a new 
laser technology. 
</P>
<P>
USC officials confirmed that there have been discussions about relocating the 
institute, which now leases property on the UCI campus, to Los Angeles. 
However, they said, institute work could continue at both sites if USC beats 
out six other universities seeking the U.S. Department of Defense grant. 
</P>
<P>
The Beckman institute's participation "helps tremendously" USC's chances of 
winning the grant, according to Pablo Valencia, a USC biomedical engineer and 
coordinator of the project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Premature Speculation 
</P>
<P>
UCI Chancellor Jack Peltason said, however, that speculation that the institute 
or its director, UCI medical professor Dr. Michael Berns, might move is 
premature. 
</P>
<P>
"We treasure the relationship with the Beckman Institute and anticipate that it 
would continue in the future," he said. "As far as I know, Dr. Berns is going 
to stay here." 
</P>
<P>
Berns declined comment Wednesday on negotiations for a move or a satellite 
operation at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a faculty member at UCI, and I'm not moving my program right now," Berns 
said. He said it is up to the nonprofit institute's board of directors "to 
decide whether it is in the best interest of the institute to move or to stay." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach board president Dr. Arnold Beckman were unsuccessful 
Wednesday. Beckman, the multimillionaire founder of Beckman Instruments, has 
contributed $5 million to the institute since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Star Wars Technology 
</P>
<P>
The proposed USC project is for a free electron laser, which operates at a 
higher intensity and broader frequency than existing ones, making a single 
laser potentially useful in treating a wide variety of illnesses, according to 
Robert Spears, assistant dean of clinical affairs at USC. The technology, which 
grew out of Star Wars weapons research, theoretically could be used to kill 
brain cancer cells without harming delicate surrounding tissue or to destroy 
the AIDS virus in the blood supply, according to USC officials. 
</P>
<P>
Research with the new technology at USC depends on funding, Spears said, and a 
decision on the federal grant is not expected for several months. 
</P>
<P>
UCI sources said USC's overture is aimed at recruiting Berns, and they 
expressed doubt that the institute or staff members would follow him. News 
leaks about the negotiations come at a time when Peltason has demanded an 
accounting of donations to the institute and compensation paid to UCI faculty 
and staff who work there. 
</P>
<P>
Berns, a nationally-recognized pioneer in medical use of lasers, is a professor 
of surgery and cell biology. He founded the Beckman Laser Institute in 1982 and 
remains the leading force there. The institute treats patients with cancer, 
vascular disease, eye problems and other ailments, and recently has performed 
widely publicized surgeries on exotic animals, including a boa constrictor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Donations 
</P>
<P>
Although the institute was built with private donations and is governed by its 
own board, it is staffed by UCI employees, and all research conducted there is 
done under the auspices of the University of California. Under a lease-back 
agreement with UCI, the institute must operate a research center on the Irvine 
campus for 30 years or forfeit its building and much of the equipment inside. 
The agreement, however, would not prevent the institute from operating a second 
facility elsewhere, UCI officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"From what we can tell, this is a serious recruitment by USC," according to one 
informed source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Michael (Berns) has 
threatened to leave a number of times before and never has. But the institute 
is another issue -- if they leave, they walk away from the building and the 
great majority of the equipment in it. If this is a bluff on Michael's part to 
get the chancellor off his back, then the bluff may be called." 
</P>
<P>
The source said that Berns recently angered Peltason when he formed a separate 
fund-raising group of wealthy supporters for the institute without UCI's 
participation. Peltason has proposed adding two paragraphs to the agreement 
governing the relationship between the university and the research center. The 
amendments would require financial reporting to the university, according to 
the source. 
</P>
<P>
The institute has raised $15 million over the last 6 years, including a 
$5-million endowment. Although Beckman is considered likely to take his dollars 
wherever Berns goes, university officials downplayed speculation that other 
donors would also be swayed. 
</P>
<P>
The only existing free electron laser is located at Stanford University, but 
USC officials said the addition of the Beckman Institute's technological 
expertise makes USC the West Coast favorite if federal officials mete out 
dollars with an eye to geographic balance. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to USC, finalists for the federal grant money are Duke University, 
which recently recruited the developer of the Stanford laser, the University of 
Utah, Northwestern University, Baylor University and Vanderbilt University.
