OSCARS: ACADEMY VOTERS SPLIT THEIR BALLOTS, BUT THEY FAIL TO DO JUSTICE. THEY 
OVERLOOKED THE DIRECTORS OF 'DAISY' AND 'GLORY' -- AND THOSE FILMS WON A 
COMBINED SEVEN OSCARS.

When they decided to move the Oscar show back to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 
we knew tickets would be tight; we didn't think they'd forget to invite the 
year's best directors. 
</P>
<P>
Where were Bruce Beresford and Ed Zwick? Where was Spike Lee? Beresford and 
Zwick, who were not nominated for best director, had their names mentioned in 
more "thank you" speeches than God, Michael Ovitz and best-director winner 
Oliver Stone combined, and their movies -- "Driving Miss Daisy" and "Glory" -- 
carted off a total of seven awards. And Lee cast a shadow over the stage 
without even being asked to come on down. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the auteur theory. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, "Driving Miss Daisy" was the evening's biggest winner, with four 
Oscars, including the one for best picture. But it will be a year with 
asterisks all over it in the record book. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Stone won as best director for a movie, "Born on the Fourth of July," 
that collected only one other award, for editing. "Driving Miss Daisy" won as 
best picture, making it the first film since the 1932 "Grand Hotel" to win best 
picture without even earning a nomination for its director. It was a night when 
an animated film swept the music awards, winning for its score and its calypso 
centerpiece, "Under the Sea." It was also a year when an industry audience rose 
to give a relatively unknown foreign actor -- Daniel Day-Lewis -- a standing 
ovation, proving to some cynics that -- on this occasion at least -- they know 
a little something about acting. 
</P>
<P>
The 62nd Oscar show was what it was billed to be, a wide-open race. Stone's 
"Born on the Fourth of July" was the only film given a chance at a sweep, and 
it got swept instead. It went two for eight. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the outcome was in doubt right to the end. "Driving Miss Daisy" had a 
3-1 edge on "Born" in their four previous head-to-head categories, but because 
best pictures and best directors are usually paired in the voting, no one would 
have been surprised to hear "Born" pulled out of the last envelope. 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty of this year's results may have made for livelier office pools 
and Oscar parties, and after years of boring one-picture sweeps, it's 
encouraging to know the voters can split their ballots. But what did the split 
mean? With a clear choice between a film that was full of warm intentions and 
gentle performances -- "Driving Miss Daisy" -- and one that had the anger of a 
decade crammed into little more than two hours -- "Born on the Fourth of July" 
-- the voters teetered back and forth then settled on the gentle number. 
</P>
<P>
The academy blew its opportunity for a compromise when it failed to nominate 
for either best picture or best director Ed Zwick's fine Civil War epic 
"Glory," probably the most Oscar-like film released during the whole year. What 
held it back? The performance of Matthew Broderick? Zwick's TV background, 
which had some people calling "Glory" "eighteensixtysomething"? 
</P>
<P>
We'll never know, but when it came time to cast their final ballots, the 
general membership was definitely in a "Glory" mood. It won in three of the 
categories for which it was nominated. 
</P>
<P>
Beresford's absence from the formal program was certainly noted. Billy Crystal, 
calling "Driving Miss Daisy" the "movie which apparently directed itself," made 
the first reference during his opening monologue, then the parade of "Driving 
Miss Daisy" winners further drove home the point. Four times, the academy's 
live orchestra broke into that catchy "Miss Daisy" theme while winners worked 
their way to the podium to thank -- among others, but never forgetting -- their 
Australian director Beresford. 
</P>
<P>
G'day mate. 
</P>
<P>
If "Driving Miss Daisy" was the best film of the year -- if it was just one of 
the five best -- Beresford should have had a formal invitation. 
</P>
<P>
The academy didn't make a statement this year, it surrendered to the times. 
During the Reaganized '80s, while only one irreverent political film (Stone's 
"Platoon") was making it to the winner's circle, Hollywood and the academy were 
tamed by supply-side economics and the irreversible thawing of the Cold War. 
The victory by "Driving Miss Daisy" -- at both the box office and in the Oscar 
contest -- suggests that gentle we go into the '90s, as well. 
</P>
<P>
If the country was in an introspective mood, Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing" 
would have at least been in contention. 
</P>
<P>
Lee was there, as a nominee for best original screenplay, but it proved just 
one more disappointment for supporters of the year's most critically-acclaimed 
film. Several people mentioned the film's Oscar snub during arrival interviews 
on local TV, and Kim Basinger -- in what qualifies as a tense moment in the era 
of the 45-second clock -- chided the academy for overlooking the film that told 
"the greatest truth of all." 
</P>
<P>
If Lee was the victim of a backlash, so might Stone have been. Late-in-the-race 
assaults by right-wing political pundit Patrick Buchanan -- along with nay 
saying critics who repeated Buchanan's charges that Stone and co-screenwriter 
Ron Kovic had revamped history to suit their own political agenda -- didn't 
help. Similar criticisms leveled against Michael Moore's "Roger &amp; Me" are 
thought by many to have buried that movie with the academy's documentary 
nominations committee. 
</P>
<P>
Stone said Monday afternoon that the press had blithely accepted Buchanan's 
charges without giving him or Kovic a chance to respond. "I have not been 
contacted by anyone about playing 'fast and loose' with the facts," Stone said. 
"I always said these were composite characters . . . This has been an attack on 
(Kovic) that was inspired by the right wing." 
</P>
<P>
The feature documentary Oscar to the makers of "Common Threads: Stories from 
the Quilt" may ease some of the pressure on the academy's documentary 
nominations committee. The group was excoriated by critics this year for 
omitting "Roger &amp; Me" from the final ballot. Last year, the group was 
excoriated for overlooking Erroll Morris' "The Thin Blue Line." In both 
instances, committee members defended themselves by saying there were five 
better candidates than either "The Thin Blue Line" or "Michael &amp; Me." 
</P>
<P>
That argument doesn't stand up to the scrutiny of the nominees. There was not a 
better documentary in 1988 than "The Thin Blue Line," and "Roger &amp; Me" -- 
whatever its maker's lapses -- is certainly better than most of this year's 
choices. But it isn't better than the actual winner. "Common Threads," made by 
the producers of the Oscar-winning "The Times of Harvey Milk," took five names 
from the AIDS quilt and examined the impact of the lives and deaths of those 
people on loved ones left behind. It was exceptionally well-made and almost 
overwhelming in its indictments of the plague's myths and the federal 
government's lethargic response to it. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if the academy is serious about maintaining an image of integrity in its 
nominations process, it must overhaul its documentary committee format and put 
the fate of documentary filmmakers in the hands of their peers.
