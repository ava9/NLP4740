Disney's plans to reinvigorate the cinema cartoon / Screen

THE RENAISSANCE started with a rabbit called Roger. Although a little slow
and rather clumsy, Roger has reinvigorated the world's appetite for an art
form that 10 years ago was said to be facing extinction - the cinema
cartoon.
Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, released by Touchstone in 1988, won critical
acclaim and a couple of Oscars; more importantly, it grossed Dollars 154m
and persuaded Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, there was money in
feature-length animated films.
Disney, concerned at the losses on its theme park investment in Europe, has
decided to increase production of its profitable feature films. In the past,
movies were released at a rate of one every three years; that gap narrowed
last year with Aladdin, Disney's latest offering, following the success in
1991 of Beauty and the Beast. The company now to plans to produce two
feature-length animated films a year and is banking on European expertise to
help draw them.
The US company regards Europe, and London in particular, as a centre for
excellence in modern animation. So the skills which first gained
international recognition with the antics of Roger Rabbit are now being
actively pursued by the most famous studios of them all.
A senior executive from Walt Disney this week arrived in London to recruit
artists for a new generation of animated films. Unlike classics such as Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs, these productions will not be years but months
in the making. Max Howard, vice president of Walt Disney Animation in
Florida, thinks European animators are the ones to make it happen.
Walt Disney, he says, is keen to produce more animated features because,
against all the expectations of the early 1980s, they are proving wildly
popular. Attracted by the new dimensions of Who Framed Roger Rabbit? - the
first widely-distributed feature to use computer technology - cinema
audiences have flocked to see Beauty and the Beast, which grossed Dollars
147m in the US and Pounds 94m in the UK.
In Aladdin, due to be released in the UK later this year, one of the
characters is entirely computer driven. A magic carpet - hand drawn and then
committed to a computer's memory - moves around the screen in a way few
artists could emulate. It turns and twist in three dimensions, offering the
directors camera angles which where previously only available to live film
features.
Howard, who ran the Walt Disney studio in London where Roger Rabbit was
made, believes computers now allow an audience to enter the world of the
cartoon characters. That faith has paid off handsomely. Aladdin has grossed
more than Dollars 212m in the US and Walt Disney expects that figure to
double after its international release.
Audience demand for such special effects has been a major catalyst for
Disney, which intends to employ some of Britain's best animators on future
production such as The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Pocahontas, both
scheduled for release in 1995. There has also been a lucrative spin-off for
other UK talent including lyricist Tim Rice, who is currently working on The
Lion King, Disney's animated African tale, along with actor Jeremy Irons and
rock star Elton John.
At the company's studios in Glendale and Orlando, however, the contribution
of these famous names pales against that of James Baxter, a London art
school graduate recruited by Disney after working on Roger Rabbit. Baxter
went on to create Belle, the feisty heroine of Beauty and the Beast.
The US group's willingness to import overseas talent, however, masks a
growing frustration in the UK that there are no backers willing to
underwrite a home-produce animation feature. Richard Williams, the creator
of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, has failed to complete his long-awaited Thief
and The Cobbler and has returned disillusioned to his native Canada.
Only on television, where Channel Four and SC4 in Wales have invested
heavily in animation, is there a growing market. But even so, many
independent producers feel acclaimed outside the UK and ignored at home.
David Sproxton, co-director of Aardman Animation in Bristol, which last year
won an Oscar for best animated short film, says, 'The fact that Disney can
come here reflects that we do not have resources. We have skills and ideas
but not finance.' He fears that overseas studios are snapping up UK
animators because there is not enough work at home. Without substantial
financial backing, he predicts most animation studios will go on doing what
they do best - making TV commercials.
At Disney, Max Howard admits that funding has been the main brake on UK
animation but suggests that the industry may also have been hindered by the
stories it decided to bring to the screen. Walt Disney is not taking that
kind of risk. It plans to serve up more favourite dishes - fairy tales and
fables. Howard says the productions coming across the Atlantic now contain
fewer spoonfuls of sugar than in the past, but Disney is determined to pour
in enough syrup to keep hold of its biggest audience, the young teenagers.
'Great quality animation won't make a film a success,' he says. 'Look at
Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast. There has been a renaissance, but it's
still about finding the right stories to tell.'
