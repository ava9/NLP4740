There wasn't a spot of garden space vacant at the fete honoring the Ambassador 
of the Republic of Turkey to the United States, Nuzhet Kandemir, and his wife, 
Sadiye. Turkish Consul General Mehmet Emre and his wife, Sema, were exuding 
smiles and directing the crowd to the cerkez tavuk (chicken with walnuts), 
doner (beef on a spit), patlican kizartma (eggplant with green chiles), borrek 
(fried pastry) and rice pilav. 
</P>
<P>
Prominent were Mission Viejo real estate broker Vasif Canli, Los Angeles 
developer T.K. Kutay, civil engineer Nezih M. Gunal, Chasen's assistant manager 
Orhan Arli and Turan and Judy Kahraman.

Why the visit? Explained the ambassador: "To explain the business opportunities 
that exist in Turkey." J. Jamison Moore, who owns Atlantis Inc., already knows. 
He and his wife, Mara, have sold their house and will live abroad for the next 
five years to oversee his $552-million resort development near Izmir. Yachting 
was on the minds of Bud and Virginia Carpenter. He's in charge of the Los 
Angeles Yacht Club plans for 75 Southland sailors to sail on seas off the coves 
of Turkey next year.

co-chairs Carol Mancino and Donna Kamin and co-presidents Donna Wolff and 
Bridget Martens. They also chose famous gardener Georgie Van de Kamp (mother of 
gubernatorial candidate John Van de Kamp) for honorary chair.

WOW! It helps to have former President Ronald Reagan joining entertainers Jose
