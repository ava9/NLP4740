Jack Hennessy always comes up with an opener for the Confrerie des Chevaliers 
du Tastevin white-tie dinner. This year, le grand senechal said, "Bless this 
dinner in which we share a delectable cuisine beyond compare." He also 
implored, "May the bubbles, the whites and burgundy reds enliven our hearts, 
not lighten our heads." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Magnin, owner of Ralph Lauren in Beverly Hills, chaired the festivities 
at the Beverly Wilshire, home of the late hotelier Hernando Courtright, a 
Chevaliers founder. Before dinner, Magnin and William L. Martin II (l'officier 
cellier of Chevaliers) inspected the wines to be served. Grand Connetable 
Louis-Marc Chevignard flew in from France for the occasion to oversee with 
Thomas W. Trainer (la commanderie d'Amerique) and John H. Hadley and Hubert F. 
Laugharn Jr. (la sous commanderie le Los Angeles) the grand inductions of les 
candidats Robert C. Boffa, Lee Danielson, Peter J. Doumani, Clifford A. Miller, 
Peter W. Mullin and Nelson C. Rising. They swore "to lead a good gastronomic 
life." 
</P>
<P>
For the night, cares were shrugged off in favor of the grape vine. Having a 
jolly time in La-La Land were many, including Hadley and his wife Barbara, 
honored for 33 years of leadership in the group. Cheering him -- Roger and 
Billie Converse, Z. Wayne and Cynthia Griffin (down from Sun Valley) and 
Chevaliers Jon Masterson, John Maher, Henry Singleton, Donald Crowell, Stephen 
Griffith, Desmond Hinds and Daniel Ridder. 
</P>
<P>
MILE HIGH: Bill Shoemaker stood a mile high for the tributes Santa Anita Park 
bestowed the night before "The Legend's Last Ride." Santa Anita chairman Robert 
Strub called the evening "a once-in-a-lifetime occasion" and spent a pretty 
penny to honor the Shoe. 
</P>
<P>
What made it nice were all the tender kisses wife Cindy bestowed on her husband 
and the quips from Amanda, their 9-year-old daughter, who was one of the stars 
on the Ralph Edwards' "This Is Your Life" production put on at the affair for 
Shoemaker. Amanda appeared on stage in racing colors and broke up the audience 
when she commented, "When my mother and I go shopping for my dad, she always 
tells them he's 4 feet, 11 inches, but he's well-built in the shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Robert and Betty Strub and some greats of racing -- trainer Charlie 
Whittingham, jockey Johnny Longden, Dr. Robert Kerlan -- sparked the night 
along with videos of the great scenes of racing. Applauding were Frank and 
Margarita Kanne, and Felix and Barbara McGinnis, among others. 
</P>
<P>
VITAL NEEDS: Many of the city's most prominent Catholic families turned out for 
Archbishop Roger M. Mahony's award dinner at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.

were long-time philanthropists Sir Daniel Donohue, Mrs. G. Allan (Marian) 
Hancock, William Hayden, Mrs. Thomas (Dorothy) Leavey and Cyril Nigg. Hancock 
and Hayden were unable to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the affair will go to DARE (the LAPD's Drug Abuse Resistance 
Education) in Catholic Schools and for aid to archdiocesan homeless shelters -- 
the Long Beach Family Shelter, the Good Shepherd Center for Homeless Women and 
the St. Vincent de Paul Men's Center.
