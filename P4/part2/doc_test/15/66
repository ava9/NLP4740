ALFRED WOODFORD; GEOLOGY TEACHER AT POMONA COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alfred O. Woodford, founding director of the Pomona College geology department 
nearly 70 years ago and a teacher who trained many of the best-known geologists 
on the West Coast, has died at a retirement community in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
Don Pattison, a spokesman for the college, said Woodford, known to his 
colleagues and students as "Woody," was 100 when he died Friday. He had retired 
in 1955 after an affiliation with Pomona that began in 1909 as a student. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Upland, his father, Butler A. Woodford, was manager of the Sunkist 
Orange Assn., while his grandfather, Alfred P. Harwood, was a member of the 
Chaffey Land Co., which began developing the area that today is Ontario and 
Upland. The Harwoods were among the earliest supporters of Pomona College. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Woodford, who graduated from Pomona in 1913, enrolled there to become a 
soil scientist. But the embryonic oil boom then under way led him into geology. 
He began teaching geology in 1919 while taking graduate classes at UC Berkeley. 
After receiving his doctorate three years later he founded a one-man 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years its students came to include Rollin Eckis, former executive 
chairman of the board of the Atlantic Richfield Co., Roger Revelle, former 
director of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography for whom UC San Diego's 
Revelle College is named, and C. A. Anderson, former head of the U.S. 
Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
Woodford's special field of study included the rocks and minerals of Southern 
and Baja California, stream hydraulics and the history of geology. 
</P>
<P>
When he retired he was given the Neil A. Miner Award, the highest award of the 
National Assn. of Geology Teachers. In 1963, to commemorate the 75th 
anniversary of the Geological Society of America, Woodford and some of his 
former students wrote "The Fabric of Geology." 
</P>
<P>
A widower, Woodford is survived by two daughters, six grandchildren and five 
great-grandchildren.
