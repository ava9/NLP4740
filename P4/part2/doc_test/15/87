FT  14 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Board unlikely to approve CDollars
2.8bn bid - Maclean Hunter/Rogers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Maclean Hunter, the Canadian publishing and broadcast group,
will meet this week to consider its response to a takeover bid worth at
least CDollars 2.8bn (Pounds 1.42bn) from Rogers Communications of Toronto.
Rogers, which is Canada's biggest cable TV distributor, ended two weeks of
speculation last Friday by offering CDollars 17 per share, plus a portion of
the proceeds from the sale of MH's US cable TV franchises if they realise
more than CDollars 1.5bn after expenses. Rogers has already bought an 8.3
per cent stake in MH on the open market.
MH is unlikely to give its unqualified approval. Expectations that the
Rogers offer is not the last word were reflected in a 38 per cent rise in
MH's share price last Friday to CDollars 17.38. But Mr Ted Rogers, Rogers'
chief executive, has insisted the bid will not be raised.
The alternatives being explored by MH include alliances with other
companies, a recapitalisation and the sale of its Canadian cable TV
business.
Among the uncertainties facing Rogers is whether the MH board will allow the
bid. MH's shareholder rights plan makes a takeover all but impossible unless
it is permitted by the board.
Mr Rogers claims the merger is needed to create a Canadian multi-media group
powerful enough to stand up to big foreign predators and the domestic
telephone industry.
