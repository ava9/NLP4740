It is ironic that Capt. Will C. Rogers III has been awarded a top military 
honor (Part I, May 28) for his command of the guided-missile cruiser Vincennes, 
which became the focus of international controversy last July when it 
mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner in the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 
people aboard.

<P>
What is the rationale for such a public display by the Navy? Could this event 
not have taken place at a private ceremony?
