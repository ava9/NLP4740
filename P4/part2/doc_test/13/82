SUPERSTITION? IT'S ALL A PART OF THE BALL GAME; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: IN THE WORLD OF SPORTS, THE BOYS OF SUMMER ARE ESPECIALLY PRONE TO 
PERSONAL VOODOO.

The Baltimore Orioles wear black stirrups instead of orange . . . and win a 
game. Slugger Mickey Tettleton puts on a Dick Tracy T-shirt . . . and breaks 
out of a slump. Relief pitchers pose like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle figures, 
hop over white foul lines or sing on the mound . . . and save games. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidence? You decide. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball players have long been a superstitious lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone believes in their own way," Tettleton says with a smile that 
barely cracks a jaw as square as Dick Tracy's own. 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton gave an inadvertent boost to the big upcoming flick by letting on 
that he was wearing a Dick Tracy T-shirt under his uniform when he recently 
emerged from a frustrating slump at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"I got it in the mail, I don't even know where it came from," he demurs. 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton probably isn't the most superstitious Oriole -- despite his current 
streak, he hasn't even decided whether to keep wearing the T-shirt. But he's 
the most highly publicized one when the subject comes up. During a hot streak 
last year, for example, it was Froot Loops: His wife revealed that the cereal 
was the breakfast of this particular champion, and a legend was born. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes, and baseball players in particular, can be more prone to 
superstitions than the rest of us, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"There is such an element of chance in baseball, it makes it vulnerable to 
magical thinking," says Jim McGee, the Orioles' former team psychologist. "And 
there may be the sense that baseball, compared to other sports, is 
extraordinarily traditional. They still do things in 1990 that they did in 
1890." 
</P>
<P>
And who's to argue with someone like Joe Orsulak? His team-leading batting 
average -- for the third straight year -- lends credibility to his particular 
superstition. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like pitchers touching my bat. It's bad luck," the outfielder says. "I 
won't use it if a pitcher's touched it." 
</P>
<P>
Orsulak has also used a sort of personal voodoo to psyche out a pitcher who has 
caused him difficulty in the past: He wore a T-shirt with the pitcher's name 
and face on it the next time he had to face him. 
</P>
<P>
"I got hits off him," he reports. 
</P>
<P>
But certainly the most superstitious player award on the team goes to Brian 
Holton. Hey kids, you, too, can be a major league relief pitcher! Clip and 
save: 
</P>
<P>
"I get dressed the same way every day. Then I button just three buttons of my 
warm-up jacket. I go and get a towel and wrap it around my neck, and the tag 
always has to be on the right side," Holton says. "I put two cans of Copenhagen 
(smokeless tobacco product) in my pocket, one from spring training and a new 
one. In my left pocket I carry a lasso. . . . I found a piece of rope in San 
Diego once (in 1988) and made a lasso out of it and we went on a winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
"I always sit in the same seat in the bullpen and in the dugout," he continues. 
"I come up on the mound from the first base side. I wipe the (pitching) rubber 
four times with each leg and spin around clockwise. I catch the ball with one 
foot on the dirt and one foot on the grass. I never change catchers. If he's 
not ready (after batting in the last inning), I wait for him, I don't throw to 
anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"I always sing on the mound to myself, whatever they're playing," Holton adds. 
"If they're not playing anything, I'll sing, 'You take the high road, I'll take 
the low road.' " 
</P>
<P>
Relief pitchers, says McGee, who was team psychologist from 1980 to 1986, may 
need such rituals more than other players because of the unique nature of their 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
"Their tension level is always high, they can't tell when they're going in," he 
says. "If they don't perform their rituals, they feel anxious."
