Fountain Valley High School, turning the Sunset League title chase into an arms 
race, continued to get impressive pitching Tuesday in a 2-0 victory over Ocean 
View at Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Senior right-hander Steve Montgomery allowed only two hits and struck out five 
as Fountain Valley (10-4, 5-1) gained sole possession of first place in the 
six-team league. Montgomery (4-1) gave up a bloop single in the first inning 
and a single that glanced off his glove in the seventh in completing his first 
game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
It was Fountain Valley's third shutout in its past six games and marked the 
third time an opponent has failed to advance a runner to third base against the 
Barons. What's more, Fountain Valley has allowed only four earned runs in its 
past six games. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been around baseball a long time, and I've never seen pitching like 
this," said Ron LaRuffa, Fountain Valley's coach. "I knew pitching would be one 
of our strengths, but I never expected anything like this. 
</P>
<P>
"They hit a couple of fisted balls or Montgomery could have had a no-hitter. 
Steve's fastball had good pop, and he was jamming people all day." 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery retired 14 consecutive batters after giving up a scratch single to 
Dan Hernandez in the first inning. Gary Christopherson collected Ocean View's 
other hit, a hard-hit grounder that glanced off Montgomery's glove. 
</P>
<P>
"Our bats are laying in the rack right now, we're not getting any production 
from the top of our lineup," said Steve Barrett, Ocean View coach. "We didn't 
hit the ball hard all day. Montgomery ate up some pretty good hitters today." 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View (12-5, 4-2) has found it difficult scoring runs on the road. Last 
week, the Seahawks lost to Edison, 1-0, on a disputed home run. But the team's 
best pitcher, Randy Karliner, is expected to return Saturday after a groin 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley scored the only runs of the game in the second inning when 
LaRuffa sent Steve Lancaster home from first base on a double by Mike Walcott. 
Ocean View shortstop Dan Hernandez appeared to have Lancaster out at the plate, 
but Hernandez's throw glanced off Lancaster's helmet and sailed to the backstop 
as Lancaster scored. 
</P>
<P>
Walcott moved to third on Hernandez's throwing error and scored on an infield 
out by Garren Ito that moved Fountain Valley ahead, 2-0. Later, LaRuffa 
admitted that sending Lancaster home was a big gamble. 
</P>
<P>
"If they make the play, he's out by a mile," LaRuffa said. "My philosophy has 
always been to force an opponent to make the plays. We put the pressure on 
them, and we were fortunate to get two runs." 
</P>
<P>
Westminster 8, Marina 3 -- Chris Larson and Ryan Klefko each had three hits, 
including a double, scored two runs, knocked in two runs and stole a base for 
host Westminster (10-6-1, 2-4). Pitcher Mark Murphy got the victory and Brett 
Grebe the save. Marina is 9-8, 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach 3, Edison 2 (8 innings) -- Brian Wright, who had three hits, 
scored the winning run on a passed ball. Pitcher Josh Faur came on in the sixth 
inning to get the victory for visiting Huntington Beach (6-10, 2-4). Edison's 
only score came on J.J. Thobe's two-run homer in the first inning.
