Whether he's crouched behind the plate or streaking through a secondary on a 
post pattern, Steve Friedrich of Troy High School has a knack for catching a 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
Friedrich helped Troy win the Freeway League baseball championship this past 
spring by moving from the outfield to catcher and batting .353 with 26 hits. 
Friedrich, a natural outfielder with speed, had caught only three junior 
varsity games as a sophomore but earned all-league honors as a catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Friedrich caught 36 passes for 633 yards and six touchdowns to lead 
Troy to a Division VI playoff berth. He already has 18 receptions for 218 yards 
and four touchdowns in three games this season. Tonight, Troy faces Valencia at 
Placentia's Bradford Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen him play twice and it's pretty obvious the guy has very good 
hand-eye coordination," Valencia Coach Mike Marrujo said. "He does things on a 
football field that you can't teach. I saw him catch a (long pass) against El 
Dorado two weeks ago and I was very impressed." 
</P>
<P>
Said Troy Coach John Turek: "He seems to catch anything. He never seems to 
worry about getting hit, and when the ball is up for grabs, he seems to win the 
majority of the battles with defensive backs." 
</P>
<P>
Friedrich had never played organized football before high school. He was a 
third-string tailback and started at free safety on the Troy freshman team, 
then was promoted to the varsity as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
After a year of watching from the sideline, Friedrich established himself as 
one of the county's top receivers in 1989, teaming with quarterback Greg Windle 
to lead Troy to a second-place finish in the Freeway League. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran mostly post patterns last year, but this year Greg and I haven't really 
used any set patterns," Friedrich said. "Our passing game is a lot more 
complicated than last year." 
</P>
<P>
Friedrich had the best game of his career last week in a 26-16 victory over 
Brea-Olinda. He caught nine passes for 93 yards, including touchdowns 
receptions of 25 and 12 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his success on the football field, Friedrich's future appears to be in 
baseball. He attended the Stanford baseball camp last summer and is 
anticipating a big senior season. 
</P>
<P>
"My size (5 feet 10, 170 pounds) has a lot to do with my future," Friedrich 
said. "My future is probably in baseball. I've been playing baseball since my 
dad taught me how to play catch when I was 2 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Friedrich played in the Yorba Linda Little League and was a starting left 
fielder for Troy's junior varsity team as a freshman. He had played shortstop 
and in the outfield when Troy Coach Dane Illertsen asked him about catching 
before last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone said it looked weird seeing someone with speed catching," Friedrich 
said. "But I really enjoyed catching. I liked the challenge of holding 
baserunners and I liked being in control of the pitchers and setting the 
infield." 
</P>
<P>
Friedrich, who is projected as a collegiate outfielder, continued to polish his 
catching skills at the Stanford camp with 110 players from throughout the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a lot about hitting at the camp," Friedrich said. "I corrected a 
flaw in my swing, and I'll start working in the cages the day after football 
ends." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Friedrich will continue to torment secondaries as Troy hopes to end 
the eight-year reign of La Habra and Sunny Hills as champion of the Freeway 
League. Troy was ranked among the county's top teams in most preseason polls, 
but the Warriors fell from the top 10 after their loss to Rancho Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad we're not rated," Friedrich said. "Last year we stayed away from 
publicity and had a good season. We had a good spring and everyone was excited 
going into this season. But for some reason, we weren't mentally ready for 
Rancho. 
</P>
<P>
"The loss was probably good for us. It made us realize we can lose any time 
we're not ready to play. All along, our goal has been to win the league title." 
</P>
<P>
Turek, who has led Troy to six consecutive playoff berths, expects Friedrich to 
play a key role in the team's drive for a league title. 
</P>
<P>
"I anticipate Steve breaking the school records for receiving if he stays 
healthy," Turek said. "He's getting more double coverage than we've seen in 
awhile, but he's still averaging six catches and has scored in every game."
