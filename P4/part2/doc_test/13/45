DODGERS COULD HAVE RECURRING DREAM OR TERRIBLE NIGHTMARE IN '89

It is late on a Monday afternoon, Oct. 2, 1989, and Dodger Stadium is shrouded 
in shadows. It is the top of the ninth inning of a one-game playoff between the 
Dodgers and San Diego Padres to determine the champion of the National League 
West. Jay Howell, the Dodger reliever, is attempting to protect a one-run lead. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two outs. Roberto Alomar is on third, Tony Gwynn is on second. First 
base is open. The batter is Jack Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Scioscia, the Dodger catcher, looks into the dugout for a sign. Tom 
Lasorda, the manager, gives him the go-ahead to pitch to Clark. In the Padre 
dugout, Manager Jack McKeon flashes a wicked grin. Howell checks the runners, 
then delivers his pitch. It's a fastball, belt-high, headed for the middle of 
the plate. Clark swings, and . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Lasorda should have his share of nightmares this summer. This business 
of repeating as champions of big-league baseball is no stroll through the park 
-- no revelry in Riverfront, no soiree in Shea, no carnival in Candlestick, no 
barbecue in Busch, no whimsy in Wrigley. 
</P>
<P>
Has anyone heard Lasorda popping off this spring, guaranteeing back-to-back 
titles like his basketball counterpart, Pat Riley of the Lakers? Well, yes, 
actually, when Lasorda spoke in Vero Beach, Fla., at the 30th reunion dinner of 
the 1959 Dodgers, the first L.A.-based Dodger team to win a World Series. But 
the next day, Lasorda hastened to amend his remarks to a reporter. What he 
meant to say, Lasorda insisted, was that he hoped this team would become the 
first Dodger team to repeat, and the first in baseball since the New York 
Yankees whipped Lasorda's Dodgers in 1977 and '78. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers of the Duke and PeeWee, Jackie and Skoonj, Newk and Campy, never 
won two Series in a row. The Dodgers of Koufax and Drysdale, the Davis boys, 
Wills and Roseboro? Nope. Garv and the Penguin, Fergy and Reggie, Lopes and 
Russell? Uh-uh. 
</P>
<P>
So, the wise guys are looking pretty smug these days when they peg the Dodgers 
to take a classic fall, rather than wind up in the Fall Classic, again this 
season. Of course, these are the same wise guys who picked the Dodgers to 
finish no better than fourth in 1988, so go figure. 
</P>
<P>
What do we think? That not even Sylvester Stallone would dare to write a sequel 
to match last year's Orel IV, which co-starred Kirk Gibson as The Natural and 
featured a bunch of scene-stealers called Stuntmen. 
</P>
<P>
But scanning a diamond full of Dodgers, it's relatively easy to project a 
season of Lasorda's fondest dreams, or most terrifying nightmares. Herewith, 
position by position, are best-case and worst-case (in italics) scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
First base -- Eddie Murray returns to the city of his birth, Los Angeles, and 
terrorizes the National League the same way he tore up Little League in South 
Central Los Angeles. The switch-hitter shatters the club record for home runs 
of 33, held by Steve Garvey and Pedro Guerrero, drives in more than 100 runs, 
wins another Gold Glove, and is voted the team's "Good Guy" award by reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Murray is a $2-million bust, his once considerable skills continuing an 
erosion that began in Baltimore last season, when he was hitting .231 with four 
home runs in June and didn't recover until Frank Robinson, the manager, made 
him a designated hitter. New contact lenses don't help, his fielding reminds 
people of Pedro Guerrero, and he adds L.A. reporters to his hit list of media 
he won't speak to after someone reminds him that he batted just .228 with 
runners in scoring position last season, compared to his career average of 
.305. 
</P>
<P>
 Second base -- Willie Randolph, who didn't get as much as a phone call from 
the New York Yankees when he no longer figured in their plans, has the last 
laugh at the expense of George Steinbrenner. While Steve Sax yearns to break 
out of the Bronx Zoo, Randolph shows the same skills that made him a five-time 
All-Star, hitting close to .300, scoring nearly 100 runs, walking almost 80 
times and making Dodger pitchers wonder how they ever got by without his 
double-play touch behind them. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Randolph, who missed 52 games in 1988, breaks down a month into the 
season as either his a) knees, b) wrist or c) rib muscles give out on him. 
Randolph, who no longer can run, proves completely unsuited for the role of 
Dodger leadoff man, especially because he is hitting no higher than the .230 
average he finished with in 1988 and doesn't steal a base until just before the 
All-Star break. By July, when he turns 35, Randolph is replaced in the lineup 
by Mariano Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop -- Alfredo Griffin proves that 1988 was an aberration, when he hit 
.199 and couldn't avoid being hit by Dwight Gooden's fastball, which fractured 
his right hand and caused him to miss 57 games. Griffin's average returns to 
the .258 range, which is what he hit in 12 seasons in the American League, and 
his play at short ranges from the steady to the spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Griffin, whose .141 average in day games last season was the worst in 
the National League, proves his performance was no fluke as his average drops 
below his playing weight. By July, Griffin is so bewildered at the plate that 
Lasorda contemplates replacing him with Mariano Duncan, except Duncan has 
already replaced Willie Randolph. So, Lasorda calls on Dave Anderson, the only 
National League player with 200 or more at-bats in each of the last four 
seasons to fail to hit .250 or better in any of those seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Third base -- Jeff Hamilton, finally providing stability at a position that 
has been tried by 22 Dodgers during the '80s, justifies Lasorda's description 
of him as the best third baseman in the league by batting a respectable .250, 
reaching double figures in home runs, and by showing off his bazooka for an 
arm. All of the above show why the Dodgers were 50-29-1 in his 80 starts last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hamilton, given the starting job in spring training even though he has yet 
to convince skeptics he can hit big-league pitching, falters badly at the 
plate. He fails to match his 1988 ratio of one home run per every 50 at-bats, 
which is how he finished with six home runs. Afield, he continues a trend he 
began in Florida, when he made eight errors. By July, Hamilton is in 
Albuquerque and Tracy Woodson is the third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
Left field -- Kirk Gibson, ignoring his sore right knee, improves all of his 
numbers with Eddie Murray hitting behind him in the Dodger lineup and becomes 
the first National League player to win back-to-back MVP awards since Atlanta's 
Dale Murphy (1982-83). Gibson hits dramatic home runs, scores from second base 
on wild pitches, and terrorizes his teammates into winning. Even Orel Hershiser 
adopts his spiked-hair look. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson, who has averaged just over 100 games in his 10 big-league seasons, 
becomes a regular on the Dodger disabled list, as his right knee fails to hold 
up under the strain Gibson places on it. Gibson tries to play through the pain 
and tries every possible cure. With the pennant on the line in September, 
Lasorda reluctantly sends up Dave Anderson to pinch-hit for the crippled 
Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
Center field -- John Shelby. One of the most underrated Dodgers, Shelby quietly 
strings together another season like 1988, when he set career highs in games, 
at-bats, runs and triples, batted .263 and had a league-best 24-game hitting 
streak. After hitting only 10 home runs in 1988, Shelby returns to his 1987 
form, when he hit 21 homers for the Dodgers in just 120 games. 
</P>
<P>
 John Shelby, the easiest player to strike out in the league last season -- he 
averaged one strikeout for every 4.3 plate appearances -- continues the slump 
that began in the postseason, when he struck out 19 times in 12 games against 
the New York Mets and Oakland A's and batted .190. By July, Lasorda is forced 
to try Mike Davis in center. 
</P>
<P>
Right field -- Mike Marshall, a picture of contentment after signing a 
three-year deal with the Dodgers, makes a mockery of opposition attempts to 
pitch around Eddie Murray by driving in more than 100 runs to lead the team in 
RBIs for the second straight season, and hits more than 20 home runs for the 
fourth time as a Dodger. He also plays in 140-plus games for the third time in 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Marshall, caving in under the pressure of being the hitter opponents dare 
to beat them, strikes out more than 135 times, his most since he went down 137 
times in 1985. Back problems return to haunt him, limiting him to the 104 games 
he played in 1987. Before the end of the season, Lasorda is platooning him with 
Mike Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher -- Mike Scioscia, in the last year of his contract, responds by hitting 
.296, matching his career best in 1985. He also shows his home run off Dwight 
Gooden in the playoffs was no fluke by reaching double figures in home runs for 
the first time in his career. And, of course, he remains the world's foremost 
plate-blocker. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Scioscia fouls up his swing by trying to prove his home run off Dwight 
Gooden was no fluke. Fears about his marketability next winter, when the threat 
of a player strike will overshadow all negotiations, make him reluctant to risk 
an injury. That becomes apparent when 5-foot-6 Rafael Belliard runs over 
Scioscia at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching -- Orel Hershiser, in the prime of his career at age 30, becomes the 
first pitcher to go through a season unscored upon. Tim Leary split-fingers his 
way to another half-dozen shutouts, Tim Belcher beats Tom Browning with a 
perfect game, Fernando Valenzuela revives Fernandomania, John Tudor reprises 
Tommy John, and Ramon Martinez -- recalled in July -- wins 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
In the bullpen, Jay Howell and Alejandro Pena record more KOs than Tyson, and 
Tim Crews, who was left off the postseason roster, and Ricky Horton make Brian 
Holton the answer to a trivia question. 
</P>
<P>
 Orel Hershiser strains his vocal cords with one too many interviews. His 
personal computer erases its memory. He loses the cheat sheet he carries with 
him to the mound. He needs therapy after giving up a home run to Ozzie Smith. 
Tim Leary shows why his teammates call him Norman Bates. Tim Belcher succumbs 
to the sophomore jinx. Fernando Valenzuela, his shoulder shot, causes Lasorda 
to curse the day he ever let Fernando throw 160 pitches in a single game. John 
Tudor, despite a gallant comeback attempt, chooses to retire. Ramon Martinez 
can't learn how to throw a curveball. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bullpen, Jay Howell is discovered to have tobacco juice stains on his 
glove, and is suspended by Bart Giamatti. Alejandro Pena takes too long between 
pitches, and is suspended by Giamatti. Tim Crews is inadvertently left off the 
regular-season roster. 
</P>
<P>
Bench -- Just as in 1988, the Stuntmen regularly save the day. 
</P>
<P>
No one thinks Mickey Hatcher is funny anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager -- Tommy Lasorda, a happy winner, gains 30 pounds by October.

 Care to wager which scenario will come closer to being the truth in 1989?
