<P>
Trading in baseball is almost a lost art. But even in its heyday, it used to be 
axiomatic that the best trades are often the ones you never make. 
</P>
<P>
This is because the worst ones are so highly visible. And humiliating. They 
haunt the general manager for the rest of his baseball life. 
</P>
<P>
The worst trade in the history of the major leagues is a matter of subjective 
evaluation, but in the hunt has to be the dealing of Frank Robinson to the 
Baltimore Orioles for right-handed pitcher Milt Pappas. A baseball rule of 
thumb is, never trade a pitcher unless you get plenty. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles got plenty. Robinson not only became one of only 13 players in the 
modern history of the game to win the triple crown (batting average, home runs, 
runs batted in), but he was the catalyst in leading Baltimore to a succession 
of pennants, World Series victories and chronic contending position. Robinson 
made the Hall of Fame. Pappas went 46-47. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis appeared to be violating the never-trade-a-pitcher principle when 
they sent right-hander Ernie Broglio to the Chicago Cubs for outfielder Lou 
Brock. Broglio was an 18-game winner the year before. But he went 14-31 for his 
career at Chicago and was out of the game in three years. Brock went on to the 
Hall of Fame, set the major league stolen base record and helped the Cardinals 
to several World Series, where he usually batted .400 and set stolen base 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Those trades were bad. But how about trading Grover Cleveland Alexander in his 
prime for -- are you ready? -- Pickles Dillhoefer?! Alex had only won 30 games 
that year and was to win 373. The immortal Pickles, a catcher, went on to bat 
.123, .091 and .213 in his next three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
It's a risky business. It used to be the only way a player could travel from 
one club to another. Player movement today is dictated by the player. He goes 
when he wants, where he wants, and he gets the money, not the seller, the club 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
A general manager, however, still has to be nervous approaching a bargaining 
session. Dennis Eckersley went to Oakland for three minor league players three 
years ago -- the immortal David Wilder, Brian Guinn and Mark Leonette. 
Philadelphia got Steve Carlton (and two pennants) for Rick Wise. 
</P>
<P>
The "trade that will help both clubs" exists only in the team's publicity 
handout. The trade that helps neither club is the more likely . 
</P>
<P>
The "throw-ins," i.e., players considered of no importance but put in to 
sweeten the attraction, and the "player to be named later" have sometimes 
enjoyed a significant role. Sid Bream, an afterthought in the deal that sent 
Bill Madlock from Pittsburgh to the Dodgers, is enjoying productive years with 
the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
So, when Dodger General Manager Fred Claire approached the negotiating table 
with the Cincinnati Reds last summer, he knew he had to keep one hand on his 
wallet and the other on a Bible. The worst thing you can do is make a mistake 
trading with a team not only in your league but in your division -- the team 
you have to beat. He knew what he needed. He wanted another bat in the lineup 
-- Kal Daniels, a natural .300 hitter with good power, was perfect for his 
purposes. He knew what Cincinnati needed -- a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Claire offered Tim Leary, a right-hander of great promise who had one 17-game 
season with the Dodgers but had struggled to achieve consistency much of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds countered they would need something else. The Dodgers threw in Mariano 
Duncan, a sometimes brilliant but erratic shortstop who had trouble hitting the 
major league curveball. When Cincinnati acquiesced, Claire pressed his luck. He 
wondered whether he shouldn't have a throw-in of his own. He got Lenny Harris, 
a good-enough ballplayer but one who found it so difficult to find a spot to 
break in the lineup that he took to wearing four gloves. To stay in the big 
leagues, he found he had to play wherever a spot opened up, either through 
injury or poor play on the part of the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
It's a tough way to launch a career, but Harris had the perfect temperament for 
it -- uncomplaining, cheerful. A utility infielder has to be like a butler. 
Ready to serve wherever he's needed. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers were delighted. On a team where cheerful acceptance is not in 
abundance, Harris was a breath of fresh air. Or at least, fresh attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Not since Jim Gilliam, have the Dodgers had a player who could roam between the 
infield and outfield and play either position with equal skill and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an outstanding young man," insists his manager, Tommy Lasorda. "He's a 
Dodger! I platoon him with Mike Sharperson, that's OK. I need him at second 
base, that's OK. We need him in the outfield? Lenny runs out there. When Fred 
Claire called me and said, 'We have a chance to get Lenny Harris,' I said, 'Get 
him!' I remember one game against us, he went after a foul ball and he slammed 
clear into the fence. But he caught it." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels is hitting a predictable -- and satisfactory -- .290 with 19 home runs 
and 62 runs batted in. Tim Leary, after a disappointing season, was traded to 
the New York Yankees, with whom he is having a mediocre year. 
</P>
<P>
But the throw-ins are prospering. Duncan is batting a rarefied .327, almost 100 
points above his lifetime average. 
</P>
<P>
And Harris is hitting a robust .296 after hovering around .300 most of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Harris is even content with his stand-in role. "I try to keep myself ready, 
keep myself concentrated. I play where I'm needed. If they need a leadoff man, 
I hit leadoff. When I knew they wanted me to lead off, I went to Brett Butler 
(of San Francisco) and asked him for some pointers on how to play it. He told 
me what you need is patience." 
</P>
<P>
Harris has that. He is patient, low profile. On a recent evening, he was found 
patiently standing at the fence signing baseballs and gloves for a line of 
young fans. 
</P>
<P>
He won't even bad-mouth a system that has scarcely let him get a full season 
under his belt to learn his trade the only place you can -- on the field. "Oh," 
he says, "Pete (Rose) played me whenever he could, whenever he had a place for 
me. I couldn't complain." 
</P>
<P>
He could have. He just didn't. 
</P>
<P>
A baseball trade is like any other business merger. You have to wait a while 
for the bottom line. So far, Lenny Harris has made the Dodgers look as if 
they've made the best deal since Wally Moon for Gino Cimoli. Or maybe since 
Grover Alexander for Pickles Dillhoefer.
