Was Kirk Gibson's "Roy Hobbs" homer in the bottom of the ninth for the Dodgers 
in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series the Greatest Moment in Baseball History? 
</P>
<P>
Or was it Babe Ruth "calling his shot" in the '32 classic? Maybe it was Bobby 
Thomson's pennant-winning blow for the New York Giants in the '51 playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you like pitching. How about Johnny Vander Meer's back-to-back no-hitters 
for Cincinnati in '38? Don't wait up to see that again. 
</P>
<P>
They're having a banquet in New York Monday night to determine which of 20 
highlight moments in baseball is the game's all-time thriller. The credit card 
company, MasterCard, polled fans and sportswriters for a promotion in which the 
proceeds will go to combat ALS, the disease that cut short the life of Lou 
Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
The promotion is all right so far as it goes. But it deals in happy moments, 
save for Gehrig's farewell ceremony at Yankee Stadium in '39. 
</P>
<P>
Now, you and I know baseball isn't all moonlight and roses, right? Baseball is 
suffering. Every home fan knows that. Consider the most famous piece of 
baseball literature of all time, "Casey at the Bat." Is that about the pitcher 
who struck him out? Is there one mention about the team that won? No, we are 
concerned here only with the fact there is no joy in Mudville. Never mind where 
there is joy. 
</P>
<P>
Take the game's anthem: "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." What's the key line? 
"If they don't win it's a shame." The guy who wrote that knew baseball. 
</P>
<P>
So, I wouldn't consider most of MasterCard's list as representative of the 
grand old game as you and I know it. I would prefer an alternate list. Such as: 
</P>
<P>
1. You say you saw Koufax pitch? Well, I saw Koufax bat. Never mind the four 
no-hitters, the strikeouts, the shutouts. The definitive memory I have of Sandy 
Koufax is in 1962 when he hit a home run off -- get this -- Warren Spahn! Now, 
Sandy was a lifetime .097 hitter with the Dodgers (he hit over .100 only once 
in his career, .177) and when he hit that home run, Spahnie chased him around 
the bases with cords standing out in his neck, calling Sandy every name he 
could think of (and, with Spahn, there were a lot of them). As Sandy rounded 
third that day, Milwaukee's Eddie Mathews growled, "You're making a sick joke 
out of this game!" A Koufax homer off Warren Spahn makes my highlight list 
hands down. 
</P>
<P>
2. You can talk of Carl Hubbell's five Hall of Famer strikeouts in an All-Star 
game, but how about Stan Williams walking in the 1962 pennant for the Giants? 
How about Manager Walt Alston ordering an intentional base on balls to the 
previous batter (Ed Bailey) to load the bases and set up the tragedy? The 
circumstances were these: The Dodgers carried a 4-2 lead into the final inning 
of the playoffs. As the disastrous inning unfolded, the Giants tied the score 
and had the bases loaded with two out when Williams walked Jim Davenport. Run 
up the pennant for San Francisco. The fateful inning saw the Dodgers 
contributing four bases on balls, an error and a wild pitch. The Giants got 
four runs -- and a pennant -- on two hits, including one in the infield. 
</P>
<P>
3. You can home in on Bill Mazeroski's home run in the bottom of the ninth that 
won the 1960 World Series over the New York Yankees, if you like. But come with 
me to the eighth inning of that game. The Yankees were leading, 7-4, as 
Pittsburgh came to bat. Gino Cimoli singled to open the inning. Then came the 
routine double-play ball that probably decided the Series. It was what Joe 
Garagiola would describe as "a room-service double play." Except that the ball, 
off the bat of Bill Virdon, hit the infamous surface of Forbes Field's infield, 
known throughout the National League as "the coal mine." It bounced off an 
outcropping of anthracite, came up and hit Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek in the 
throat. It almost cost him his voice. It cost his team the World Series. A 
short time later, a backup catcher, Hal Smith, hit a home run with two on to 
put the Pirates ahead, 9-7. He never would have gotten to bat if the ball to 
Kubek hadn't found a rock. Mazeroski's homer in the ninth would have been 
merely interesting. 
</P>
<P>
4. Some people gave some consideration to the comeback of the New York Mets in 
Game 6 of the 1986 World Series as the definitive one, and that would make our 
pantheon, too, because of the ball that trickled through Red Sox first baseman 
Bill Buckner's legs. But our vote would have gone to the 10-run seventh inning 
posted by the Philadelphia Athletics over the Chicago Cubs at Philadelphia in 
1929. Not for the comeback, for the collapse. The Cubs had an 8-0 lead at the 
time. What mades this collapse memorable was that the Chicago center fielder, 
Hack Wilson, misjudged two fly balls in the inning. One of them went for an 
inside-the-park home run and scored three runs before he could run it down. 
Now, Slugger Hack was as famous for rum as runs. With runs, he either drove 
them in -- or let them in. In this inning, he let in five runs. Years later, 
teammate Pat Malone put the right note on it: "Hack did all right for a guy who 
saw three balls." 
</P>
<P>
5. One of the early eliminations in the balloting (62 moments were originally 
cited, then culled to 20) was a relief-pitching stint of 17 innings by Ed 
Rommel of the Athletics in 1932. It was not exactly Goose Gossage stuff. Eddie 
gave up 29 hits (and 14 runs) in that stint. He gave up eight hits to one 
batter alone, Cleveland shortstop Johnny Burnett, who set a major league record 
of nine hits in a game that day. That's one game I wish I'd seen. 
</P>
<P>
6. You can cite Nolan Ryan's five no-hitters, Koufax's four or Vander Meer's 
two straight, but let's have a moment of silence for Harvey Haddix, who pitched 
the longest no-hitter in baseball history. And lost. He pitched a perfect game 
for 12 innings for Pittsburgh against Milwaukee in 1959. His opponent, Lew 
Burdette, had a 12-hitter. Haddix lost the perfect game to an error and the 
no-hitter (and the game) to a home run in the bottom of the 13th. Actually, he 
almost didn't lose the game. When Joe Adcock hit the bottom-of-the-13th home 
run, there was one out and teammates Henry Aaron and Felix Mantilla on first 
and second. When the home run cleared the fence, Aaron cut for the dugout at 
second base instead of continuing on to the plate. Adcock was declared out for 
passing him. Mantilla was called back on the field to score. Had there been two 
out, the game might have gone on. The final score went into the record book as 
1-0. Haddix lost his no-hitter, Adcock lost his home run and baseball lost a 
legend. 
</P>
<P>
You see, baseball is not all ticker-tape parades to City Hall. Baseball is 
about losing. The poet, Aeneas, wrote about "the sense of tears in mortal 
things." Baseball fans know where he's coming from. You're not a fan till your 
favorite pitcher walks in the winning run, your favorite hitter pops up with 
the bases loaded, your favorite team blows an 8-0 lead in the eighth inning. 
That's when baseball finds out who its friends are. Those are the real 
highlights. The might-have-beens.
