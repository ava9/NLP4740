QUAYLE SEES 'BRIGHT FUTURE' FOR AEROSPACE 
</P>

Vice President Dan Quayle, touring an Orange County laboratory where scientists 
simulate conditions in space, criticized on Monday a loss of national zeal 
toward space exploration but assured aerospace workers that their industry 
"does indeed have a very bright future." 
</P>
<P>
After getting a firsthand look at the "zero-gravity" lab at the McDonnell 
Douglas aerospace plant in Huntington Beach, Quayle spoke briefly to employees 
and school-age visitors as part of a four-day tour around the state. His wife, 
Marilyn, also took part in a mock disaster drill in Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
The focus on space during the vice president's visit came three days before the 
20th anniversary of astronaut Neil Armstrong's historic moonwalk and formed a 
prelude to what is expected to be a major policy statement on the issue by 
President Bush later this week. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of employees at McDonnell Douglas jammed the plant's courtyard to 
catch a glimpse of the vice president. Many were hoping that he "might give us 
some insight into what the future holds for us" at a time when federal funding 
for space programs has appeared uncertain, said Troy Richardson of Garden 
Grove, a procurement worker who attended the talk. 
</P>
<P>
But Quayle, chairman of the newly re-established National Space Council, which 
advises the Administration on space policy, shied away from discussing specific 
programs and directions. He did, however, make clear that the Bush 
Administration "is committed to a vigorous and energetic space program for 
America." 
</P>
<P>
Suggesting several times that past policies in space have fallen short, he said 
the Administration intends to see that the United States "gets back into the 
space business." 
</P>
<P>
At a talk earlier in the day in Long Beach before the Western Governors' Assn., 
Quayle expanded on his criticism of past policies, saying the government's lack 
of financial commitment and direction in the space program has created a 
"dramatic decline" in the numbers of aerospace scientists, engineers and others 
in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing later to the hundreds of "future scientists" from local schools and 
youth groups who heard him talk at the McDonnell Douglas plant in Huntington 
Beach, Quayle said the presence of the children marked "a very good sign that 
the space program is on its way to recovery." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Olin of Laguna Niguel, who brought her Girl Scout troop to hear the 
vice president, said: "It was absolutely thrilling for all of them, an 
opportunity to be so close to someone of such national importance." 
</P>
<P>
Excited schoolchildren from the summer program at Sowers Middle School in 
Huntington Beach shouted, "I shook his hand! I shook his hand!" after the 
appearance. But several in the group, professing no interest in space, said 
they were disappointed that Quayle had not told them much about what it was 
like to be vice president of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle also faced an occasionally tough audience at a morning breakfast with 
reporters in Los Angeles. Asked about his apparent penchant for verbal gaffes, 
Quayle blushed deeply, fiddled with his coffee cup and said: "Well, everybody 
can make a mistake. . . . If that's the worst thing I do in the next six 
months, then the first six months will be in pretty good shape." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier this week about the anniversary of the moonwalk, Quayle 
mistakenly referred to former astronaut Buzz Aldrin of Laguna Beach as "Buzz 
Lukens." Donald E. (Buz) Lukens was the Ohio Republican congressman who was 
recently convicted of having sex with a minor. 
</P>
<P>
And in a recent talk to the United Negro College Fund, he said, "What a waste 
it is to lose one's mind," a confusion of the group's slogan, "A mind is a 
terrible thing to waste." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the slip-ups, Quayle told reporters that he is winning over those who 
doubted his abilities to handle the vice presidency and has learned to trust 
his own judgment after a draining political campaign that made him the target 
of intense criticism over his National Guard service and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of skeptics during the campaign about how I would work out, 
but now they're seeing it work out in a very normal, comfortable way," he said. 
"I think I'm being reviewed well as vice president because people see how I am 
performing -- the responsibility I have, the working relationship I have with 
the President." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "When you go through that kind of day-in and day-out barrage, you 
really have to dig down deep inside and ask yourself what you're made of. 'Do 
you have it?' . . . When you looked at yourself in the mirror in the morning 
you had to realize that what had gotten you to the place you are is yourself. 
And the one critical mistake that I made was to rely on the advice of others. 
If I had it to do over again, I'd do it differently." 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday morning, Marilyn Quayle trumpeted one of her own special causes 
during a visit in the county. At the Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center, 
she got a demonstration of an Orange County-based program that trains 
volunteers to respond to emergencies and disasters nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The local program of the National Disaster Medical System, run jointly by 
various federal agencies in conjunction with the local chapter of the Red 
Cross, is one of only a half-dozen like it in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Quayle, an advocate of greater emergency preparedness, asserted the 
need for greater coordination and attention to the program but backed away from 
the issue of direct federal funding. "Just don't ask me for money," she joked 
to the group of volunteers who attended the visit.
