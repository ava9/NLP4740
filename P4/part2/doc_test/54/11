Photo, One good click deserves another -- Fans flock to photograph entertainer 
Donny Osmond as he and former astronaut Buzz Aldrin become inductees Wednesday 
at the Orange County Walk of Stars in Anaheim. Then Osmond, who lives in 
Irvine, returned the favor, saying: "I've never been bronzed before. This is 
really an honor." Aldrin was on Apollo 11 crewman in July, 1969, and became the 
second man to walk on the Moon. He lives in Laguna Beach. KEN HIVELY / Los
