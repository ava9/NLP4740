The Soviet Union lost "stable radio contact" with its backup space probe to the 
Martian moon Phobos, possibly dooming an ambitious program to scout out 
possible landing sites for a manned expedition to the planet, Tass said today. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, the Soviets lost contact and abandoned the first of the twin 
Martian probes, Phobos I, but space engineers redoubled efforts to ensure 
success of the sister probe, Phobos II, to Mars and the Martian moon Phobos. 
</P>
<P>
Tass reported that contact with Phobos II was lost on Monday when the probe 
focused its cameras to take pictures of the tiny Martian moon, which is 17 
miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
"After these operations were completed, the information was to be sent back to 
Earth, but Mission Control was unable to establish stable radio contact with 
the probe as scheduled," Tass said.
