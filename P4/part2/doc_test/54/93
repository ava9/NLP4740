With Buddhist blessings and bittersweet memories, a 27-foot-long replica of the 
space shuttle Challenger was unveiled in Little Tokyo on Friday in honor of 
Col. Ellison Onizuka, one of seven crew members who died in the shuttle 
explosion more than four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
One-tenth the size of the Challenger, the memorial stands in the middle of a 
plaza named after Onizuka, the first Asian-American in space. 
</P>
<P>
"With this project now fixed to the street that bears his name, all of you have 
given my husband, Ellison Onizuka, a very proud sense of permanence here in the 
City of Angels," said his widow, Lorna, before she pulled a cord unveiling the 
fiberglass model with the help of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and several 
astronauts from the American and Japanese space programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you for remembering with me and my children and my family a man who 
gently touched our lives in very special ways and then went away," said 
Onizuka. 
</P>
<P>
So true in detail is the monument that astronaut Col. Loren Shriver quipped 
that "if we have too many more problems with (the space shuttle) Columbia and 
hydrogen leaks, we may come and ask the committee if we can borrow this shuttle 
and use it for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Money for the $250,000 memorial is being raised by the local Japanese-American 
community. The replica sits atop a black granite base with a bronze plaque, 
bearing a large relief bust of Onizuka, and an inscription in English and 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"Born and raised in a simple rural community, he walked a remarkable path that 
led from the coffee fields of Kona, Hawaii, to miles above the earth," reads 
part of the inscription. 
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated Challenger launch was the second space flight for the 39-year-old 
Onizuka. Less than two minutes after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986, the Challenger 
exploded, killing all seven aboard.
