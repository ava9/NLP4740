Beam Me Up, Admiral: The nation's top military man was on the bridge of the 
Enterprise Monday. Adm. William J. Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, was at Paramount to do a cameo in "Cheers," and asked to visit the 
nearby set of "Star Trek: The Next Generation." Knowing when he was outranked, 
the head man of the Enterprise, Capt. Jean Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), 
graciously relinquished his chair to the admiral during the brief visit. ALEENE
