"Loose Cannons" (citywide) is yet another mismatched buddy-buddy cop movie. 
Even though director-co-writer Bob Clark has a bright, genial style, there's a 
foredoomed feel about it all. Gene Hackman is the tough, irreverent old pro, 
Dan Aykroyd is his overly sensitive, on-the-edge partner and, once again, they 
battle their way through a screaming maze of psycho criminals, car-chases and 
wisecracks to find happiness. 
</P>
<P>
As a buddy couple, Hackman and Aykroyd are not bad. Hackman's shaggy realism 
rubs up nicely against Aykroyd's nervous artifice, and they get some nice, 
relaxed badinage together. But the movie is like another race at the dog track, 
with the script as the mechanical rabbit. The writers, Clark and the father-son 
team of Richard and Richard Christian Matheson, must feel people are tired of 
drug czars. Here, their villains are Nazis, and the Macguffin at first seems to 
be a porno movie involving Hitler. Since Dom DeLuise is also in the cast -- as 
Gutterman, an S&amp;M impresario -- you might imagine Mel Brooks lurking behind 
this somewhere. No such luck. 
</P>
<P>
The main gimmick is built around Aykroyd's virtuoso mimicry. His character, 
Ellis Fielding, suffers from a personality disorder that makes him break out, 
under stress, into multiple TV and movie star impressions -- as if Rich Little 
were playing "The Three Faces of Eve." At odd moments, Fielding becomes Popeye 
the Sailor, The Roadrunner, Dirty Harry, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and 
most of the casts of "The Wizard of Oz" and "Star Trek." 
</P>
<P>
The movie keeps dropping its own balls. Fielding is introduced as a Sherlock 
Holmes-style deductive whiz, a quality that never resurfaces for the rest of 
the movie. Instead, we get the "Odd Couple" with "Lethal Weapons." Prissy 
Fielding has just emerged from a Benedictine monastery with monk psychiatrists 
and he lives in a white-on-white apartment with tapes of beach sounds. Slob Mac 
has just had his apartment burned down and he lives in his station wagon, with 
his possessions, his cat and a leaky bag of cat litter. Instead of parking this 
mess somewhere, he goes on duty with his possessions strapped to the roof, even 
getting into high speed chases with them. 
</P>
<P>
So there we are: crazed Nazis fighting odd-couple cops, one of whom suffers 
from TV schizophrenia. The FBI gets into the tangle too, along with the Israeli 
Secret Service, led by Riva (Nancy Travis) a Cosmo cover-girl type in an partly 
unbuttoned blouse. 
</P>
<P>
There are moments when Aykroyd goes into one of his impressionist attacks, or 
when Hackman looks around him with one of his crinkled "Can you believe this?" 
grins and you realize how good they both can be. But, despite them, "Loose 
Cannons" (MPAA rated R, for violence and language) is a movie without ideas, 
armament without much ammunition. Like most Buddy-buddy cop movies it plays 
like Sisyphus and his rock; crashing back down the hill almost before you can 
roll it up.
