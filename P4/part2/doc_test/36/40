PARAMOUNT Communications, the US entertainment group which is the subject of
a bidding war, yesterday announced a joint venture with television group
Chris-Craft Industries to launch a new US broadcast TV network.
The network, due to come into operation at the start of 1995, would
initially present four hours of original pro gramming over two nights a
week.
Paramount yesterday described the venture as a 'fifth national network',
though its original programming would initially fall far short of the
existing four - ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox.
The Paramount and Chris-Craft stations which will comprise the core
affiliates of the new network reach some 27 per cent of US television
households.
Wall Street analysts said attempts to establish a fifth network were hardly
new, and Paramount would face an extremely hard task in a very competitive
environment. 'It will be the 15th fifth network,' said one.
Some analysts were also surprised by the timing of the move, in the middle
of a takeover contest.
The deal does not impinge directly on the battle between Viacom, the cable
company making a friendly Dollars 9.5bn bid for Paramount, and QVC Network,
which has launched a hostile offer worth the same amount.
Viacom yesterday welcomed the fifth channel project, which it described as
'one more example of the limitless potential that makes the future for
Paramount-Viacom so exciting'. However, QVC has indicated that it would sell
Paramount's television stations if it took the company over.
The new network would be jointly owned and operated by Paramount and
Chris-Craft, which holds 70 per cent of BHC Communications, owner of a group
of eight TV stations.
Paramount's television group is a leading producer of programmes for the
existing television networks and for first-run syndication. It also owns
seven television stations.
The network's four hours of original material would feature 'Star Trek:
Voyager', a new series developing Paramount's 'Star Trek' science fiction
programme.
It would acquire additional original programmes from Paramount and other
producers, but has yet to decide on news programming.
Paramount said affiliated stations carrying the introductory, prime-time
blocks of programming would include the six Chris-Craft stations which are
independent of the existing networks and Paramount's four independent
stations.
The Chris-Craft stations include WWOR, which serves the large New York
market, and KCOP in Los Angeles.
