"Harlem Nights" is the first movie to co-star Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor. 
Watching the sorry, unfunny mess that has resulted is like witnessing a highly 
touted heavyweight title bout that inexplicably turns into a pat-a-cake session 
between cruiserweights. Even those of us who have just about given up on Murphy 
hoped the pairing with Pryor would snap him to attention. But it's been a long 
stretch since either Murphy or Pryor has thrilled audiences with anything more 
than their star power. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time -- say, seven or eight years ago -- when such a confab would 
have raised the rafters. Murphy began his four-year stint at "Saturday Night 
Live" during the 1980-81 season, and his appearances on that show, with his 
impersonations of pimps, jailbirds, Gumby, Buckwheat and Bill Cosby, are still 
his comic high point. He could create characters that had the whole country 
talking about them the next day. Pryor, of course, had a thriving if uneven 
movie career in the early '80s. His glory, however, was his stand-up comedy 
films, particularly the 1978 "Richard Pryor Live in Concert" and the 1982 
"Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip." They were the movies in which Richard 
Pryor could be Richard Pryor. 
</P>
<P>
In the intervening years, Murphy has become a major movie star largely at the 
expense of what made him a TV star. He has moved away from the quicksilver, 
revue-sketch humor and the edgy playfulness of his "SNL" days and turned 
himself into a commodity. His comic facetiousness has turned stone-cold. 
Whereas he once professed his idol to be Richard Pryor, his movies suggest 
another deity: Sylvester Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy is a movie star because his films make fortunes, but is there anything 
stellar about his work as a '30s nightclub dandy in "Harlem Nights," a movie in 
which his character's homicidal streak is played for cheap laughs? Is there 
anything anointed about his work in such films as "The Golden Child," "Coming 
to America" or "Beverly Hills Cop II"? His reprehensible 1987 stand-up comedy 
film "Raw" begins when, leather-suited, he strides on stage amid hoopla not 
inappropriate to the Second Coming. The film was a real potpourri of hatred. In 
it, his free-floating hostilities descend on women, gays, whites, blacks -- 
take your pick. To review it was to leave the domain of criticism for 
psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
Stardom can sometimes enlarge an actor's possibilities and bring out what was 
nascent, and best, in his talents. The reverse seems to have happened to 
Murphy. In "SNL," he was part of an ensemble; he was challenged by the other 
performers. In his movies, starting with his first (and still best) film, "48 
HRS," where he co-starred with Nick Nolte, Murphy has essentially been 
performing solo. He works with such crackerjack precision that sometimes he 
doesn't need anybody else around; he can be his own most appreciative audience. 
</P>
<P>
But Murphy desperately needs to be challenged in the movies. Yet, given the 
fact that he controls them so completely -- he is writer, director and 
executive producer of "Harlem Nights" -- how will that ever happen? His clout 
has allowed his worst instincts to come through. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Pryor is playing his surrogate father in his new film, but there's an 
element of condescension in the casting. Pryor is positioned as Murphy's wise 
and cautious mentor, an elder statesman. It's the kind of "tribute" that's 
indistinguishable from neutering. 
</P>
<P>
If Eddie Murphy's star power has allowed him all too successfully to tincture 
his films with the poison of his stand-up-comedy attitudes, then Richard Pryor 
has the opposite problem. His box-office clout has allowed him the opportunity 
to make a series of marginal movies with virtually no connection to his great 
stand-up persona. In films ranging from "The Toy" to "Bustin' Loose" to 
"Brewster's Millions," Pryor has opted for the cushiony comforts of family 
entertainment. With his pick of writers, directors and co-stars, he has 
nevertheless willingly led himself into creative oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
It's never been easy for a volatile talent to score in the movies; the 
commercial demands of the business are invariably at odds with true 
subversiveness. But Pryor has the kind of control that might have preserved his 
rawness on film, not only in his concert movies, but in his dramatic films too. 
The cuddliness of his screen image is a sick joke. It might seem like a put-on 
if only Pryor showed some sign that he was in on the con. But he is resignedly 
bland in his movies; anything malign or threatening has been bleached out. 
</P>
<P>
With an artist as troubled and complicated as Pryor, it's difficult to assign 
motivation. Does a film like "Bustin' Loose," where he plays a good-natured 
grump to a busload of kids, represent what Pryor thinks the movies deserve? 
Does he think such movies represent what he deserves? Obscenity has always been 
the fuel of Pryor's art, and these roles can't accommodate it. 
</P>
<P>
He has never quite given up entirely, though. Bad as it was, his 1986 
autobiographical film "Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling," which he also 
directed, was at least an attempt to scour the treacle from his image. In films 
like the 1972 "Lady Sings the Blues," playing Piano Man to Diana Ross' Billie 
Holiday, the 1978 "Blue Collar," where he played a Detroit auto worker, and the 
1981 "Some Kind of Hero," where he played a POW returning from Vietnam, he gave 
indications of wanting to do more as an actor than just make nice. For years 
there was talk that he was preparing a biography of Charlie Parker. 
</P>
<P>
The problem may be that Pryor believes that, in order to quell his demons, he 
can't draw on anything in his life that means anything to him. In "Live on the 
Sunset Strip," talking about his recuperation after his free-basing accident, 
he says, "Maybe I ain't funny anymore. Maybe I ain't hungry at nothing for real 
in my heart." But the triumph of that film was that Pryor demonstrated he could 
be an artist without working up a fount of rage. Pryor has been funnier than he 
was in that film, but he was never as mysteriously moving, or as fragile. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Pryor has always been mischaracterized as a riotous comic. He was 
never really a social-activist crusader; his stand-up riffs exposed racism, but 
his humor was deeply personal, screwed up, aloof. The Get Whitey agenda of the 
early '70s never quite played for Pryor as it did for the other black comics 
and actors because Pryor was after private demons, not white demons. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding whites, he went beyond rage and into stupefaction. (That's what made 
the scene in "Silver Streak" where he attempts to teach Gene Wilder how to be 
black such a howl.) His landscape was ultimately interior. He could split 
himself into an entire gallery of characters: winos, junkies, hustlers, movie 
executives, ex-wives. He could animate inanimate objects, like, most memorably, 
his cocaine pipe in "Live on the Sunset Strip." The only thing Pryor can't play 
is normal, and that, ironically, is what he's set out to be in movie after 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
The history of black performers in the movie business is such a trail of waste 
and despair that the ascension of Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor has symbolic 
value out of all proportion to their actual achievement. With few exceptions, 
black actors have only been accepted as stars when they are comics. 
</P>
<P>
This must explain some of Eddie Murphy's rage. Deprived in his early movies of 
any love interest with his white female co-stars, straitened into situations 
where he played the black sidekick joker to white actors, he has 
overcompensated by shunting his creative energies into a makeover that probably 
means a lot more to him than it does to audiences. His attempts to promote 
himself as a stud action-hero with a curdling cruel humor must function as a 
kind of retribution for him. For some of us, it's a punishment.
