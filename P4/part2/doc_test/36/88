BIRATNAGER, Nepal 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was February, and Katmandu was filled with sturdy-legged trekkers. "When you 
get to San Diego we'll show you a good time," I overheard one American tell a 
Sherpa during breakfast at Mike's, the charming garden restaurant where 
Westerners gather daily for a $2 omelet-and-muffin feast. 
</P>
<P>
It was my final city meal before starting an eight-day trek. I didn't know it 
then, but those trekkers were the last I would see until my return to Katmandu. 
Despite the surging popularity of hiking in the Himalayas, 50,000 of the 54,000 
trekkers in Nepal in 1988 headed for just two destinations -- the Everest or 
Annapurna regions. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid the hordes, six writers were joining Steve Conlon, head of Above The 
Clouds, a Massachusetts-based adventure travel company, to try a new route 
along a ridge called Milke Danda in eastern Nepal, a region just recently 
opened to trekkers by the government. 
</P>
<P>
As we flew to the city of Biratnager, from which a bus was to drive us six 
hours north to our starting point, I could not take my eyes off the thrilling 
view from the airplane window. Cho-Oyu, Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Kanchenjunga 
-- the snowy tips of some of the highest peaks on the planet poked through the 
cloud bank below us. 
</P>
<P>
I had waited 12 years to see these majestic mountains again. In 1978 I had done 
an exhausting trek. Now my excitement at returning to the Himalayas was tinged 
with nervousness. Had I trained hard enough? Would I be able to enjoy the 
views, rather than slog along, panting, my eyes staring down at my boots as I 
had the time before? 
</P>
<P>
It was night when our bus dropped us off at the end of the paved road. We had 
climbed from near sea level to 7,000 feet -- still the "hills" by Himalayan 
standards. A row of green tents beckoned. We ate a quick traditional dinner 
(including daal bhat, the rice dish that is the staple of the Nepalese diet) 
inside a candle-lit dining tent and crawled into our sleeping bags. 
</P>
<P>
Morning dawned clear and cold. Far in the distance, across row after row of 
brown hills, we could just make out the tops of Makalu and Everest. I peeked at 
the itinerary: This day would be "an easy one," Steve had written, "gentle 
uphill along the ridge . . . with the Himalayas always before us. . . ." I was 
so eager for a closer look at the mountains that I hardly noticed how steep the 
"gentle uphill" was. 
</P>
<P>
But for Nepal it was fairly easy. That's because the Himalayas are so vertical 
that they make hiking in the Sierra or Rockies seem like a stroll in Central 
Park. Nevertheless, my physical fears were unfounded. Smart companies realize 
that not everyone wants to emulate Sir Edmund Hillary; a growing number of 
treks require less than two weeks of walking and skirt the vertical climbs via 
ridge trails. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the burgeoning number of adventure travel outfits are competing to 
lure the experienced trekker back for a second or third Himalayan experience. 
Thus, unusual routes in out-of-the-way places such as Milke Danda, the 
primitive Dolpo region and the neighboring country of Bhutan, are showing up in 
more and more trekking catalogs. 
</P>
<P>
We climbed a rocky but well-worn path bordered by strands of huge rhododendron 
trees. "In the spring the whole place is red with their blossoms," remarked 
Maitalal, a Nepalese friend of Steve's. But it was not yet spring. Well before 
our lunch stop, an ominous, clammy fog rolled in, obscuring everything more 
than three feet in front of us. 
</P>
<P>
And so began what we dubbed our "In the Clouds" trek. For the next eight days 
the fog, unusual for February, enveloped the east Nepal Himalayas. It was just 
our bad luck. October through April is considered prime time, weatherwise. But 
the January "mini-monsoon," which causes fog and rain for a few days throughout 
the country in mid-winter, had arrived late. It seemed as if the mountain gods 
were pouring pea soup from the heavens. "Now I know why the book about 
Shangri-La was called 'Lost Horizon'," I wrote morosely in my diary. 
</P>
<P>
Each morning I would unzip my tent flap and see only mist, not Makalu. Frost 
carpeted the trail in the morning. The bushes were coated with rime. Wind-blown 
ice particles turned tree branches into eerie frozen feathers. At times I felt 
I could well be in North Dakota, except for the herds of yaks that wandered 
through our camp at night, the bells around their necks announcing their 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
For a mountain lover like me it was by turns depressing, surreal and comic. 
When we got to our campsite, a broad meadow, on Day 4, Steve pointed east, 
saying, "If it were clear you would see Kanchenjunga (the world's third-highest 
mountain) right over there." We dutifully stared into the blankness. 
</P>
<P>
Then at precisely 2:51 p.m. a patch of blue appeared in the sky. Something 
white was on the horizon! Was it Kanchenjunga or merely an illusion? 
</P>
<P>
I scurried up the nearest ridge for a better look. Within a minute the fog 
pulled down the curtain again. Determined to catch whatever tiny glimpses 
Mother Nature decided to offer me, I perched on a rock, scanning the void. For 
two solid hours I sat there in a trance, imagining that at any moment 
Kanchenjunga might appear through the shifting vapors. Perhaps, I thought, I 
could become a Buddhist and see the mountains with my inner eye. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, my meditation cheered me up. And as the days passed I learned that 
visiting an untrekked, unspoiled area could mean more than views. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, we were not surrounded by other tourists. One friend who had 
made an Annapurna trek told me that some campsites looked like tent cities. 
Writer Jeremy Bernstein came across a Mexican restaurant in that area, and he 
described a town in the Everest region as "crawling with trekkers of every 
size, shape and nationality." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe east Nepal soon will be overrun, too. But during our eight days we did 
not see any other trekking party. Indeed, the only Westerners we met were two 
anthropologists who were living there. 
</P>
<P>
Because I could not see the scenery I paid attention to the people. And they 
returned the favor. 
</P>
<P>
Some villages were desperately poor. (Nepal is one of the world's most 
poverty-stricken countries.) Barefoot, begrimed, coughing children huddled 
around smoky fires inside tiny wood shacks, yet their parents were consistently 
welcoming, always ready to pour us cups of tea. Not a single child tugged at 
our skirts begging for rupees, as many apparently do in areas more frequented 
by tourists. 
</P>
<P>
As we descended the ridge we saw classic scenes: water buffaloes pulling crude 
plows through terraced planting fields, women washing their beautiful long 
black hair at public water spigots. 
</P>
<P>
We saw bizarre ones, too, such as a barefoot prisoner (we were told he had 
murdered his mother) shackled to a policeman, being led on foot to the nearest 
town. At one schoolhouse we visited tiny classrooms where elementary grades 
children were learning to read. Then classes came to a halt as Steve spoke to 
the youngsters in Nepali. At another, scores of children gathered around while 
he pulled a paperback atlas from his pack and showed them where "America" is. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the village of Chainpur we strolled through the weekly market. Rural 
people, many of them women with elaborate gold rings through their noses, set 
up shop in an open-air square selling all kinds of goods: huge cakes of brown 
sugar, tasty tangerines, plastic bracelets. I bought what looked like a 
grapefruit for 2 rupees (a fraction of a penny), sliced it with my knife and 
took a bite. Surprise! It was a gigantic, very tart lemon. 
</P>
<P>
At the final campsite our Sherpa cook baked a farewell cake. In whipped egg 
whites on top was a message: "See you again." There's a good chance of that. 
The most rewarding aspect of the journey was the one I did not train for. 
Despite the fog this trek gave me a fascinating glimpse into a poor but proud 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
I had come to see the Himalayas; instead, I saw Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
Getting Here: I flew Lufthansa from New York via Frankfurt to Katmandu, a trip 
that happily avoids a night layover in the New Delhi airport. Lufthansa, 
Singapore and Thai International are among the airlines that fly from the West 
Coast to Katmandu. It is also possible to fly to Bangkok or Hong Kong and make 
connections to Katmandu. 
</P>
<P>

from the Nepal Embassy. Call (202) 667-4550 for details. Trekkers must have a 
permit; major trekking companies will obtain one for you.

Cost: Land costs of treks vary widely, as does length, level of difficulty, 
amount of luxury provided and other factors. In general, a trip with one of the 
best-known, American-based outfits runs $50 to $100 a day. Some Katmandu-based 
outfits charge considerably less. You can also bring your own gear, hire your 
own porters and guide through small Katmandu agencies, and do an independent 
trek for as little as $25 a day.
