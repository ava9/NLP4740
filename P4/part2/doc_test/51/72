  [Text] Blantyre, Feb 21 (AFP) -- Malawi's Defence Minister 
Wilfred Mponela has disclosed that 2,730 of the country's feared 
Young Pioneer force, recently disbanded, are in neighbouring 
Mozambique, emerging from a civil war. 
  Major General Mponela said that military sources in 
Mozambique had indicated that the Pioneers are in camps held by 
the formerly rebel Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo), the 
semi-official DAILY TIMES reported Monday [21 February]. 
  The new figure contradicts a previous official version of 
between 200 and 500 Pioneers still unaccounted for. 
  Michael Chimutu, the head of the disbanded Pioneers, long 
considered a private army operating for Malawi's ageing 
President Kamuzu Banda, last week told journalists and diplomats 
that 500 Pioneers remained unaccounted for. 
  Minister of State John Tembo often puts the figure at 200. 
  Mponela, who officially retired from the army on Friday and 
was appointed defence minister in December after a 30-year 
career, said the disarmament of the Pioneers, codenamed 
Operation Bwezani (Return), will continue because "the nation 
wants peace." 
  He said the army will ensure that May 17 general elections 
are held in a peaceful atmosphere. The army will not be allowed 
to vote in the first free poll since independence in 1964 to 
prevent it from being divided into factions. 
  "Soldiers cannot vote because they are non-partisan," 
Mponela 
stated, according to the DAILY TIMES. 
  The chairman of the disarmament committee, Lieutenant 
General 
Mankin Maulana, last week expressed the military's concern that 
arms retrieved from the Pioneers do not tally with inventories. 
  Malawi and Mozambique have agreed to cooperate in the 
repatriation of the Pioneers. Banda's government was officially 
neutral in the Mozambican civil war that followed independence 
in 1975 and ended with a peace pact in October 1992.
