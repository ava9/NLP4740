  [Text] Lusaka, 10 Feb (ZANA/PANA) -- Malawian opposition 
leader, Chakufwa Chihana, has refuted reports that he would seek 
an immediate re-definition of Malawi's border with Zambia to 
retrieve some lost tracts of land, if voted into power in the 
coming presidential election in his country. 
  Chihana, who is on a two-day private visit to Zambia, told 
reporters in Lusaka on Wednesday [9 February] that at no time 
did he say he would seek the re-definition of the border between 
Zambia and Malawi. "It should now go on record that I have 
never and will never make such demands unless I am mad", he said. 
  He attributed what he called, the misleading reports to the 
Malawian Government and fellow opponents who, he said, had 
teamed up to malign him before the Zambian Government. 
  "Zambians are our brothers and sisters and I should assure 
you that my intentions are that when the need arises, Malawians 
and Zambians should meet to consider breaking the border so that 
the two peoples could mix freely. We are one and the same 
people,"Chihana said.
