MALAWI'S President Kamuzu Banda has pledged to do everything in his power to
ensure the June 14 referendum on whether the country should switch to
multi-party rule is free and fair, Reuter reports from Blantyre.
He announced he had accepted a proposal mooted by the United Nations that
there should be a single ballot box at each polling station rather than
separate ones for Yes and No votes.
Mr Banda's pledge came as Amnesty International said pro-democracy
campaigners in the referendum were likely to face attacks, death threats,
arrest and prosecution.
'I will do everything to make sure this is a free and fair referendum,' the
president said. The government had previously insisted that two ballot boxes
be used at each polling station, prompting opposition charges that this
would make vote-rigging easier.
Pro-democracy activists in Malawi, who had threatened to boycott the
referendum if two boxes were used, described Mr Banda's announcement as a
'humiliating defeat' for the ruling Malawi Congress party.
Amnesty, a London-based human rights organisation, said in a report that
regulations appearing to protect free speech for campaign participants were
deeply flawed and ineffective.
'Those who do speak out for multi-party democracy are likely to face human
rights violations. Unless the government takes urgent steps to guarantee
basic human rights, the referendum cannot be considered fair,' it said.
Amnesty has been refused access to Malawi, ruled for 29 years by
life-President Banda, after alleging serious human rights abuses there for
many years.
It called on the government to protect the rights of participants in the
referendum campaign and to release Mr Chakufwa Chihana, a trade unionist
serving a nine-month jail sentence for sedition.
