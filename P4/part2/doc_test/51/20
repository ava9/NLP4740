  [Text] Blantyre, June 6 (AFP) -- Malawi's Alliance for 
Democracy [AFORD] says it has abandoned talks with the ruling 
United Democratic Front [UDF] and is now formulating a working 
alliance with the Malawi Congress Party of ex-president Kamuzu 
Banda. 
  Alliance (AFORD) second vice-president Rev. Peter Kaleso on 
Monday told AFP in an interview that talks with MCP were 
advanced and "we are waiting to write a letter of understanding." 
  Kaleso said the talks were initiated by the Congress Party 
(MCP) after AFORD twice failed to reach an accord with the Front 
(UDF) on forming a coalition government after last month's first 
democratic elections. 
  AFORD, led by outspoken trade unionist Chakufwa Chihana, had 
demanded some key ministerial portfolios. 
  "We think we can make a good opposition with MCP and we will 
give UDF a tough time in parliament because they will always be 
outvoted," Kaleso said, adding that his party's aim was to see 
that democracy thrived. 
  "We don't want to end with one big party and destroy the 
rest. We would end up being a one-party state," he said. 
  Aford won 36 seats, the MCP 55 and the UDF 84. The UDF is 
five seats short of a working majority in parliament. 
  Chihana -- who has called MCP a party of death and darkness 
-- was quoted recently as saying it was better to convert the 
devil to work with them. 
  MCP's publicity secretary Hetherwick Ntaba confirmed in a 
newspaper interview that talks with AFORD were under way. 
  "Yes we are having talks with AFORD... We should be 
finalising the discussions in the course of next week," he told 
the DAILY TIMES published on Monday.
