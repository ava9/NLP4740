  [Text] His Excellency President Bakili Muluzi has appealed 
to all political parties and people of this country to forget 
the past and work together constructively toward the development 
of Malawi. 
  President Muluzi was speaking at the Kamuzu Stadium in 
Blantyre today after being sworn in as the first president of a 
multiparty Malawi. He said the democracy which Malawi has now 
embraced should be used constructively for the welfare of every 
Malawian. President Muluzi also stressed the need to coexist 
peacefully and to tolerate people of different political views. 
The president pledged that his government would endeavor to 
develop the available resources in the country for the 
betterment of every citizen. He said his government's 
priorities are poverty alleviation and food security. 
  In his inaugural speech President Muluzi also declared that 
he would not condone corruption and mismanagement of the 
country's resources because the country is poor. He said he 
will ensure that measures are put in place to check corruption. 
The president then promised to improve the efficiency of the 
civil service to make it more effective in discharging 
government services and enhancing the country's economic 
development. He explained that he was aware that the morale in 
the present civil service was low and promised to look into the 
issue soon. 
  Commenting on the democratization process in Malawi, 
President Muluzi said he would make sure that democracy is never 
curtailed in the country. In order to sustain this process and 
to improve human rights in the country, the president ordered 
the closure of (Mukuyu), (Nzaleka), and Nsanje prisons which, he 
said, were used to abuse human rights. He also ordered the 
release of all political prisoners and commuted death sentences 
to life imprisonment. President Muluzi also allowed human rights 
organizations to visit this country's prisons without any 
hindrance. 
  In his speech, the president declared the new state house in 
Lilongwe as the new parliament and also announced that a 
committee would be set up to dispose the country's many state 
presidencies. President Muluzi then thanked the international 
community for supporting Malawi's democratization process and 
hoped for continued assistance. He also expressed gratitude to 
churches in Malawi for the leading role they played in changing 
the country's political system and urged them to continue being 
the society's watchdogs. 
  Turning to outgoing President Ngwazi [Paramount] Dr. Kamuzu 
Banda, President Muluzi said he deserves respect and he will be 
remembered for the role he played in this country. At the 
ceremony which was attended by thousands upon thousands of 
people, Mr. Justin Malewezi was also sworn in as vice president.
