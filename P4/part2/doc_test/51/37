  [Text] First to Malawi. Question: Can the new men in power 
in Malawi get their act together? They are in the news this 
morning and it seems the answer to that question is not yet. 
The United Democratic Front, the UDF, won the presidency 
outright in the recent elections, but not the parliamentary 
elections. So, they started talking to one of the smaller 
parties, Aford, the Alliance for Democracy, about the 
possibility of working together. Well, Aford's terms were that 
there should be a coalition government and that its party 
leader, Mr. Chakufwa Chihana, should become a vice president. 
The talks have been going on since last week, but the news this 
morning is not good. The meeting has been called off, there is 
no agreement. On the line to Blantyre, David Stein asked the 
defense minister of the UDF government, Cassim Chilumpha, why 
the talks have broken down. 
  [Begin recording] [Chilumpha] We don't think that really we 
should be talking about a coalition government. What we should 
be talking about is Aford joining the government, just like the 
two other parties have. During those discussions we offered 
them three ministerial posts and we also said that we couldn't 
accept that Mr. Chakufwa Chihana should be vice president 
because constitutionally there can only be one vice president in 
the country and you can't have two vice presidents. That vice 
president has already been sworn-in anyway, so there is no post 
of vice president that Mr. Chihana can take up. So, we said, if 
that is the case, we didn't see the reason for continuing the 
talks, because we felt that there was no need for us to form a 
coalition government. All we could do was offer ministerial 
posts to Aford. 
  [Stein] As far as you are concerned then, have these talks 
effectively collapsed? 
  [Chilumpha] We didn't set another date for, you know, 
continuation of the talks, you know, as we see it, the door is 
still open for Aford to come and join us in government and that 
is where I understand we left off. 
  [Stein] Will you approach them again or will they have to 
come to you? 
  [Chilumpha] Well, that is a matter which, you know, we will 
have to examine as we go along, but as of now, our position is 
that really the ball is in the court of Aford. We have told 
them exactly what we can offer and we think that if they are 
serious in working with us, they should take us up on that offer. 
  [Stein] Are you prepared to compromise at all? I mean, after 
all, let us look at the role of Mr. Chihana, a very experienced 
politician who, some would say, would be an asset to your 
cabinet, and they say that they want him to be vice president. 
Would you consider offering him another key position? 
  [Chilumpha] I think that UDF made it very clear that if he 
wanted a ministerial post that could be given. 
  [Stein] But so far the posts you have offered are those of 
forestry and physical planning, and I don't think Mr. Chihana 
will probably think those were high profile enough. 
  [Chilumpha] Well, again, that is where the problem really 
lies. I think that if we are going to, you know, make headway in 
these, you know, talks, and in building a new Malawi, we should 
not come with preconceived ideas and conditions that demand. I 
think we should just come, you know, over to talk, you know. 
UDF has been all along saying that let us, you know, talk, it 
was Aford who snapped at us in December to say they couldn't 
work with us, because they called us all sorts of names -- 
rapists, murderers, and so on. All along, you know, we have kept 
the door open to them, saying that we should come and work 
together. We did work together during the referendum, but we 
have been snapped at all along and all we are doing now is to 
extend the same arm of friendship and cooperation to them and we 
think that it is high time that they should come over and join 
us. [end recording] 
  Well, let us hear from the other side now, Aford, the 
Alliance for Democracy. Their secretary general is (Meke 
Mtewa). On the line, David Stein asked Mr. (Mtewa) if his party 
would be prepared to continue negotiating with the ruling UDF. 
  [Begin recording] [(Mtewa)] Actually, I don't think it is us 
who have been approaching the party of the United Democratic 
Front. They have had the privilege and pleasure of approaching 
us in the past. If it is their intention to continue to talk 
about anything material including, of course, the maintenance of 
national unity, I am afraid, my party, the Alliance for 
Democracy, is interested in both issues, and would continue to 
talk with them for the duration and tenure of the government. 
  [Stein] Let's talk about the specific things that you are 
trying to achieve from these particular talks, which is, one, an 
indication that this government could be a coalition government 
and two, a key role for Mr. Chihana as vice president. They 
have said that neither of those are acceptable. Would you 
consider any kind of alliance with them on another basis? 
  [(Mtewa)] We have understood them not to prefer a coalition 
with us. They are only inviting us in a limited partnership and 
that is of a participatory nature. 
  [Stein] So, would you accept that limited partnership at 
all? 
  [(Mtewa)] That is for them to offer and for us to understand 
exactly in what scope, by that, of course a limited partnership 
would mean, if indeed that is the understanding and ours, that 
we will not be delivering to them our legislative and 
parliamentary group of members in parliament, except, of course 
to the extent, only to help and to aid them in administering 
those ministries which they feel we ought to be able to share in 
that limited sense. 
  [Stein] If we take Mr. Chihana, for example, they have 
already said that he can't be vice president because there is 
already a vice president. Now, why doesn't Mr. Chihana just 
accept the offer of one of those other cabinet positions? 
  [(Mtewa)] Mr. Chihana, of course, as president of the 
Alliance for Democracy has more pressing and binding 
responsibilities to lead the party, also the parliament, and to 
make sure that he organizes best and strengthens the foundations 
of this party for the next elections, including those of 
district and town council, and such other municipal elections 
forthcoming in this country. I cannot see him accepting any 
such role in the United Democratic Front government at this 
stage. 
  [Stein] Is it true that Aford has been holding meetings with 
the MCP [Malawi Congress Party] about the possibility of working 
together? 
  [(Mtetwa)] Purely as partners in the maintenance of this 
fragile democracy. Both the Malawi Congress Party and the 
Alliance for Democracy have, in the interest the maintenance and 
the safeguard and preservation of this [word indistinct] balance 
called the Malawi Democratic [word indistinct]. 
  [Stein] But, would you seriously consider working with the 
Malawi Congress Party against the UDF in parliament? 
  [(Mtetwa)] Not against the UDF in parliament. We will be 
working together in preservation of our democratic tradition as 
it is just beginning. [end recording]
