PRESIDENT Hastings Kamuzu Banda of Malawi was last night facing his most
serious crisis since independence in 1964 after 38 people were reported
killed as industrial unrest and looting continued for a second day.
Earlier reports of a coup attempt against Dr Banda, who is in his 90s, seem
unfounded, but the violence is a symptom of political tensions and a
deteriorating economy.
The combination of mounting opposition to his autocratic regime, led by the
church and trade union movement, and external pressure from donors which are
making aid conditional on human rights reforms, make it unlikely that Dr
Banda can weather the storm.
The unrest began in the commercial centre of Blantyre, say western diplomats
in the country's capital, Lilongwe, when 3,000 workers on strike at a
factory took to the streets on Wednesday.
Looting broke out as the workers, demanding a pay rise, were joined by
thousands of anti-government protesters, and para-military police opened
fire. Demonstrations and looting continued yesterday, said diplomats and
local residents, and the Blantyre offices of the ruling Malawi Congress
party, the country's only legal political party, were reportedly ransacked.
Earlier this year Catholic church leaders took the unprecedented step of
criticising the government's human rights record in a pastoral letter read
to congregations across the country.
Last month a leading trade unionist, Mr Chakufwa Chihana, was arrested on
his return to Malawi after calling for multi-party elections when addressing
a meeting of Malawian dissidents in neighbouring Zambia. Mr Chihana was due
to in court in Lilongwe yesterday, but failed to appear.
Donors preparing for next week's meeting in Paris of the World Bank-chaired
aid conference on Malawi have already warned the government that further
help will be linked to political as well as economic reforms.
Dr Banda has exercised a near-feudal control of Malawi since independence in
1964, ruthless in his treatment of opposition either real or suspected. In
one notorious incident in May 1983, three cabinet ministers and a member of
parliament died in what was officially described as a car crash. They were
widely believed to have been assassinated.
For several years the power behind the throne has been Mr John Tembo,
minister in the president's office and uncle of Miss Cecilia Kadzamira, a
long serving and influential figure with the formal title of official
hostess.
