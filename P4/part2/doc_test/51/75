  [Text] Blantyre, Jan 9 (AFP) -- The Malawi and Mozambique 
defence ministers hold a one-day meeting Monday aimed at 
resolving the fate of a number of armed Malawi Young Pioneers 
[MYP] who fled to Mozambique last month. 
  A senior Malawi Government official told AFP Mozambican 
Defence Minister Alberto Chipande will head his country's 
eight-man delegation to the talks. 
  Malawi's Minister of State John Tembo, who with Chipande is 
co-chairman of the Joint Defence and Security Commission of 
Mozambique and Malawi, will head the Malawi team. 
  The Pioneers were forced to flee their homes and bases when 
Malawi Army soldiers began disarming them, in retaliation 
against the shooting dead of two soldiers in northern Malawi 
last month by the Pioneers. 
  The two countries have not established the number of armed 
pioneers in Mozambique, although unofficial figures say up to 
1,000 of the 1,500 members of the armed wing of the Pioneers 
could have fled to Mozambique. 
  "We are not talking about numbers. We are anxious to resolve 
this matter because it is the Mozambicans who raised the 
question of armed Pioneers in their country," said the Malawi 
Government official. 
  President Kamuzu Banda, who established the Pioneers as an 
armed wing of his ruling Malawi Congress party and his personal 
army, announced January 1 that the two neighbouring countries 
would meet to discuss the issue. 
  "We are anxious to have them safely in Malawi," said Banda, 
whose constant call for the Pioneers to return and hand over 
weapons to the Army or police has been ignored by the Pioneers.
