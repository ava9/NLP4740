<F P=106> [Telephone interview with President Bakili Muluzi in London </F>
by correspondent Veronica Edwards on 16 June; from the "Network 
Africa" program] 
  [Text] Just yesterday on Network, we were hearing the 
reactions of some people to the departure of Dr. Hastings Banda, 
Malawi's erstwhile life president, from the presidential Sanjika 
Palace in Blantyre, making way for the country's newly elected 
president, Bakili Muluzi. Well, Mr. Muluzi is currently in 
London on his way from the OAU summit. Back home, his United 
Democratic Front [UDF] government has been criticized as being 
selfish in its allocation of cabinet portfolios and not giving 
any of the important posts to the opposition, Aford [Alliance 
for Democracy] party of Mr. Chakufwa Chihana. Last night in his 
hotel room, Veronica Edwards spoke to him and asked him first 
what it felt like to be taking over after so many years of 
one-man, one-party rule in Malawi. 
  [Begin recording] [Muluzi] Let me just mention one thing, 
Veronica. What is important to me is not the presidency at all. 
I think what is important to me is that, for the first time in 
30 years, the people of Malawi had the opportunity to cast their 
vote, choose a government of their choice, and at least they are 
now people living like people. Now, when you ask me how I feel, 
yes I feel very proud, but not proud because of my presidency 
but proud that at last the people of Malawi can express 
themselves. I think that is more important to me. It is more 
satisfying. 
  [Edwards] So, what about the negotiations with Aford. Are 
you still going to try hard to bring them into the new 
government? 
  [Muluzi] We have left the door open. Let me tell you one 
thing. I am one of those who have been saying that a leader 
never closes a door. We have left the door open and we are 
saying to Aford: Anytime they want to join the government, they 
are most welcome. Mind you, we may belong to different parties, 
but in the end, let me emphasize again, we are Malawians. We 
are working together. We should work together for the 
betterment of our people. I think that is more important. So, I 
am saying yes. We had two technical committees to look at the 
issues of, not necessarily collision but of working together, 
accommodating everybody. So, indeed those negotiations are 
going on and in fact there are three ministries which I left 
vacant deliberately, hoping that they would come and join us, 
and they will be welcome anytime. 
  [Edwards] But Aford seems to think that the three ministries 
that you are talking about are of no substance. They think they 
should actually be involved in (?important) ministries in the 
country. 
  [Muluzi] Let them tell me what is important. Is it a 
position? To me, a position does not very much count to me. Let 
me stress one thing. If you ask me, I have never been an 
ambitious person. I have never wanted to be president of 
Malawi. If, for example, Aford had won the election, if my good 
friend Chihana had won the election, I would have extended my 
hand and congratulated him, because I think what is important, 
as I told you, is not the presidency, but that, for the first 
time in Malawi, people are free. I think we should not be 
looking for positions, because if we do look for positions, then 
I think the whole thing is misunderstood. 
  [Edwards] If you can't get Aford, your party's minority 
position in Parliament could damage its legislative program and 
this could further alienate the northern sentiments. You don't 
want this to happen, because right now the people in the north 
seem to think they have been left out and they are angry. They 
are not happy with what is going on. You don't want this to 
happen, do you? 
  [Muluzi] No, I don't think you would say they are angry. Who 
are angry? I don't think you would say that. Mind you, in the 
cabinet we have, there are five ministers from the northern 
region. What you may not say is that they are members of 
Parliament. They are not members of Parliament, but we have 
five ministers from central [as heard] region and in addition to 
this, we are saying that we can offer three, four ministries. 
So, to say that they are angry, I wouldn't want to agree with 
you on that one. I think this question of talking about the 
northern region, the central region, the southern regions, these 
things should go. We are all Malawians, and I am appealing to 
those people who think regionalism--as I said earlier in 
interviews--that there is no place in the new Malawi for anybody 
who would like to divide the country. There is no place for him 
in the new Malawi. We want people who are going to think 
nationalistic, not regionalistic, because if you do that, how 
can you build the country? 
  [Edwards] Finally, I would like to know this: Now that you 
are president and the former president has now finally moved 
away from the political scene. How would you treat him? 
  [Muluzi] Let me just mention that he has not moved away from 
the political scene. He is the president, I am told, life 
president of the Malawi Congress Party [MCP]. Therefore, he is 
the leader of MCP. If the question is: He has ceased to be 
head of state. Yes, he has. What I have done, what my 
government has done is to assure him that we will look after 
him. He has been president of Malawi for 30 years. He has made 
a contribution to Malawi. It is something that we cannot 
forget. We will definitely look after him, give him a pension, 
befitting a former head of state. What we would like to 
actually show to the world and to the politicians that are 
coming in future is to say that there is always life after State 
House. There is always and there has been a tendency in Africa 
that whenever a former head of state has been replaced, the only 
place where he must go is prison. I think we must avoid that. 
I think politicians should have a future. I definitely do not 
believe in retribution. I don't believe in vengeance, because 
where do you stop? So, we will look after him. He is a 
Malawian. [end recording]
