Regional rivalries last night threatened efforts by Malawi's President-elect
Bakili Muluzi to establish a coalition government after his southern-based
United Democratic Party appeared to fall short of an overall majority in the
country's 177 seat national assembly, Nick Young reports from Lilongwe.
Poll results showed the three main parties winning support from north, south
and central regions, raising fears Malawi politics may be dominated by local
tensions.
Mr Muluzi's UDF won 84 parliamentary seats, five short of an outright
majority. He has so far ruled without co-operation with former President
Hastings Banda's outgoing Malawi Congress Party, which won 52 seats.
