  [Text] A Malawian journalist has confirmed the presence of 
Malawi Young Pioneers [MYP] personnel at Renamo [Mozambique 
National Resistance] bases in Niassa Province. THE MONITOR's 
(Clement Mthambuli) was in Mozambique recently, having 
interviewed Renamo and MYP officers. The MYP is the armed wing 
of President Banda's Malawi Congress Party [(MCP]. 
  A Renamo officer, who identified himself as Alberto Carlos, 
told THE MONITOR that MYP members are being looked after and 
will return to Malawi once Malawi Minister of State John Tembo 
requests them to do so. Alberto Carlos told THE MONITOR that 
the MCP and the MYP provided varied assistance to Renamo during 
the Mozambique war. 
  The Mozambican Government accused Renamo of sheltering MYP 
members at its bases, but that has been denied by Afonso 
Dhlakama's movement. Alberto Carlos told THE MONITOR that it 
was John Tembo, the number two in Banda's cabinet, who asked 
Dhlakama to look after MYP members and give them all the 
necessary assistance and training so that they fulfill their 
national duty. Alberto Carlos did not elaborate on what he 
meant by national duty, but apparently the MYP is getting ready 
to wage guerrilla warfare should Banda's party lose at the polls 
on 17 May 1994.
