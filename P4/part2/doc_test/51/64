  [Text] (?Three) doctors from Garden City Clinic in South 
Africa who treated His Excellency the President Ngwazi 
[paramount] Kamuzu Banda when he fell ill in October last year 
were in the country for a routine check-up on the president at 
Sanjika Palace in Blantyre. 
  Speaking to MBC [Malawi Broadcasting Corporation] at Chileka 
Airport in Blantyre on their departure for South Africa, the 
doctors said they came to Malawi to check the president's 
condition since the (?past) treatment. The doctors said they 
were greatly impressed due to the president's physical recovery 
and that they found him in good condition, which means the 
president was in good health and was continuing to make good 
progress. They said that this was contrary to the speculations 
that were going on in the South African press that the president 
was critically ill. They said they were going back to South 
Africa very happy and there are no complications and no 
infections of any kind with the president's condition.
