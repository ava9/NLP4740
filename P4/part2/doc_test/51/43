  [Text] Blantyre, Feb 18 (AFP) -- The opposition weekly 
MALAWI DEMOCRATIC said Friday [18 February] it had received 
death threats over a story about an opposition party leader, 
Bakili Muluzi. 
  The paper last week published a story revealing how Muluzi, 
favoured to win May 17 presidential race, was jailed for six 
months for stealing government funds 25 years ago while working 
as a civil servant. 
  The newspaper is a mouthpiece of the opposition Alliance for 
Democracy Party, while Muluzi is leader of the United Democratic 
Front Party. 
  "Since the story was published, we have received more than 
15 
serious death threats through telephones and written messages," 
editor Charles Simango told AFP Friday. 
  He said he was not surprised with the threats, but added "we 
had overwhelming evidence" to back up the story. "The paper 
remains unshaken as long as we report the truth," Simango said. 
  Muluzi, former right-hand man of President Kamuzu Banda, 
told 
another newspaper THE NATION that the MALAWI DEMOCRATIC had 
"sinister intentions to make the people of Malawi discredit me." 
  Muluzi, who comes from the majority south, said: "It is upon 
the people of Malawi to decide whether they want me as a leader 
or not." Observers say the newspaper revelations have damaged 
his standing. 
  A two-day constitutional conference beginning February 21 is 
likely to recommend that presidential candidates must not 
criminal records of dishonesty, a source in the national 
consultative council told AFP. [sentence as received] 
  The council, which includes representatives from all 
political parties and manages Malawi's transition to democratic 
pluralism, has been writing a new constitution which will 
adopted during the conference.
