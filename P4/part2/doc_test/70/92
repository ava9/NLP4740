Before the knee injury that almost ended his career late in the 1985 season, 
50-point games were nothing to Bernard King. 
</P>
<P>
But, after being sidelined for nearly two seasons and making a slow, painful 
recovery, the veteran forward of the Washington Bullets doubted he would ever 
reach that figure again. 
</P>
<P>
So, even though they came against the run-and-shoot Denver Nuggets, King's 52 
points Saturday night at Landover, Md., were special. 
</P>
<P>
King had 23 points in the first quarter as the Bullets scored 48 on their way 
to a 161-133 romp. 
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely the most special game in my career in the sense that I've 
come back from a major injury that no one thought I could come back from," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I always believed I would come back and play well, but I never thought I would 
score 50 points in a game after undergoing major knee surgery." 
</P>
<P>
King, 34, had already clinched the NBA scoring title before the injury in 1985. 
He averaged 32.9 points. When he was ready to play two years after the injury, 
the Knicks let him get away. 
</P>
<P>
By last season, he was averaging 22.4 points. This season he has been among the 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
And he has become more than merely a shooter. He was 20 for 35 in this game and 
had eight rebounds and six assists. 
</P>
<P>
His last basket broke Moses Malone's Washington scoring record. But he left 
with four minutes to play and missed his own mark of 60. It didn't seem to 
bother him at all. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 116, Seattle 91 -- The SuperSonics built their six-game winning streak 
against teams with sub-.500 records. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan and the Bulls made short work of the streak at Chicago. Jordan 
had 31 points as the Bulls broke a close game open in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Their fifth victory in a row enabled the Bulls to remain a half-game behind 
Milwaukee in the tight Central Division race. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 134, Golden State 130 -- Dominique Wilkins was afraid his Hawks would 
have a letdown after Friday night's upset of the Boston Celtics. So he took 
personal charge at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins scored a season-high 45 points and had 14 rebounds. His two free throws 
with five seconds left ended a rally by the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks scored 18 points in the first 3:06 and led the entire game. Only a 
traveling call against Chris Mullin shortly before he scored a basket prevented 
the Warriors from creating a tie with seven seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 120, Cleveland 114 -- The Trail Blazers, showing signs of fatigue in 
their third road game in four nights, managed to improve the best NBA road 
record to 12-2. 
</P>
<P>
Portland (27-3) opened a 14-point lead in the third quarter, but it took a 
banked-in three-pointer by Clyde Drexler with 20 seconds to play to clinch it. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers, who have won five in a row and eight of their last nine, 
wind up the trip tonight at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 109, New York 100 -- The Bucks, hoping to give their top players some 
rest for tonight's game against Portland, built a 21-point lead at New York 
early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no rest. The Knicks fought back to tie before the third quarter 
ended. It took perfect free-throw shooting (24 of 24) and clutch shooting by 
Ricky Pierce in the stretch to pull it out. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we had a breather," Pierce said. "But we started making silly fouls 
and they came back to get even." 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks are 14-0 at home. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 134, Miami 95 -- The Suns weren't about to let up on a weak team. With 
Xavier McDaniel scoring 24 points at Phoenix, the Suns won by their biggest 
margin of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns are 7-0 against the Heat. The Heat, playing for the first time without 
injured center Rony Seikaly, made it a game for a half, trailing by only six 
points. The Suns scored 49 points in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns' Tom Chambers suffered a hamstring injury in the second quarter and 
didn't return. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 99, Houston 84 -- When the Pistons were in their slump, it was largely 
because their guards weren't scoring. Joe Dumars has put an end to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Dumars scored 20 of his 30 in the first half at Auburn Hills, Mich., and led 
the Pistons to their third victory in a row. In the three games, Dumars has 70 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 114, New Jersey 105 -- Rik Smits scored 15 of his 23 points in the 
third quarter at Indianapolis to help the Pacers break open a tight game. The 
Pacers, leading by 56-52 at halftime, opened the second half with an 11-2 run 
and were never threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte 109, Orlando 100 -- Kenny Gattison came off the bench to score 19 
points at Charlotte and help the Hornets end an 11-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 90, Sacramento 79 -- The Mavericks held the cold-shooting Kings to 30 
points in the first half at Dallas and handed them their sixth consecutive 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Harper scored 26 points for the Mavericks. DAN HAFNER
