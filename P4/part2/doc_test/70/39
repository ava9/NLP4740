He was snubbed by the fans in voting for the NBA All-Star game, and Saturday 
night in Salt Lake City, Karl Malone sent a message on the court that he, 
rather than the Lakers' A. C. Green, deserved to be in the starting lineup Feb. 
11 at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Malone scored 61 points as the Jazz handed the Milwaukee Bucks their worst 
defeat ever, 144-96. 
</P>
<P>
Malone was 21 of 26 from the field and 19 of 23 from the free-throw line in 
leading the Jazz to their ninth consecutive victory. He had 18 rebounds, three 
steals and two assists in just 33 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Malone, the NBA's second-leading scorer and fifth-leading rebounder, was not 
voted as a starter for the Western Conference in the All-Star game. He 
threatened to boycott the game but said later that he would play if he is named 
as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has a sense of pride, but I've had time to think about it and I think 
I will go if I'm asked," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And if he is not? 
</P>
<P>
"I can go to Miami, or I can go fishing in Louisiana. Right now, fishing in 
Louisiana sounds pretty good to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 61 points was the highest NBA total since Michael Jordan of the Chicago 
Bulls scored 61 against the Atlanta Hawks on April 16, 1987. Malone's previous 
high was 52 this season against the Charlotte Hornets. He is the 13th player in 
NBA history to score 60 or more points in a game. 
</P>
<P>
The 48-point loss surpassed the Bucks' 136-92 loss at Philadelphia on Nov. 16, 
1968 for futility. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 125, Washington 101 -- Charles Barkley had 29 points and 18 
rebounds and Hersey Hawkins added 28 points at Philadelphia as the 76ers won 
their eighth consecutive game.

</P>
<P>
New Jersey trailed by 15 points in the fourth quarter but chipped away and tied 
the game, 101-101, with 2:03 left. 
</P>
<P>
A three-point shot by Scottie Pippen 19 seconds later put Chicago ahead for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
New York 110, Denver 96 -- Patrick Ewing scored 12 of his 26 points in the 
fourth quarter and Charles Oakley had 25 points as the Knicks broke a five-game 
losing streak.

<P>
New York, winning at Denver for the first time since 1984, never trailed and 
stayed a game in front of Philadelphia in the Atlantic Division. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 85, Minnesota 83 -- Joe Dumars made his first basket of the second half 
with 1:40 to play, snapping a tie and lifting the Pistons over the Timberwolves 
at Minneapolis. 
</P>

The expansion Timberwolves have lost nine consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 109, San Antonio 98 -- Xavier McDaniel scored 34 points at Seattle as

be out four to six weeks.
