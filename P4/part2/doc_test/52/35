Scientists trying to correct the faulty vision of the Hubble Space Telescope 
have found themselves in the dismal position of an optometrist trying to 
provide eyeglasses for a patient he can only contact by telephone. Providing 
the glasses is the easy part. Diagnosing the disease may be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, according to the experts, it may well be that the challenge will 
prove too great, and Hubble will never see with the clarity that had been so 
eagerly awaited. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists faced with such a challenge normally would spend months in the 
laboratory, working on the telescope itself, examining the tiny flaw in its 
optics with microscopes and measuring every subtle change in the curvature of 
its 94-inch primary mirror and its 12-inch secondary mirror with the most 
sensitive instruments in the world of precision optics. 
</P>
<P>
They would not be content until they could produce photographs with electron 
microscopes and perfect measurements of a flaw that is probably no larger than 
one-fiftieth the thickness of a human hair. 
</P>
<P>
This time, they cannot do that. Since extensive tests failed to reveal the flaw 
when the mirrors were manufactured nearly a decade ago, the telescope was 
launched into orbit with optics that have left the giant scope virtually blind. 
It is 381 miles above the Earth, far removed from the labs that could make 
short work of finding the flaw -- or flaws -- if it were on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists cannot go up and get it because returning the telescope to the 
ground would subject it to such contamination during the descent through the 
atmosphere -- when vents in the shuttle's cargo bay must be left open -- that 
it would probably be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
So they will have to work with the telescope where it is, unaided by the 
traditional tools of optical engineering, and there is a real possibility that 
they will fail. 
</P>
<P>
To succeed, scientists and engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena must manufacture a series of eight tiny lenses, each no bigger than a 
human thumb, that will refocus the light from the 94-inch primary mirror and 
remove the flaw. And that is the easy part. 
</P>
<P>
Before they can do that, scientists must determine the exact nature of the flaw 
and where it is in the telescope's optical system. And no one is sure they can 
do that. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I worry about at night, the only thing that causes me to lose 
sleep, is not getting the diagnosis correct," said John T. Trauger, JPL's 
project scientist on the "second generation" camera that will replace the one 
aboard the Hubble. 
</P>
<P>
The replacement camera is scheduled to be launched in about three years, and 
astronauts are to pull out the flawed telephone booth-sized camera and slip in 
the new instrument. 
</P>
<P>
If scientists have done their work right, the new camera will for the first 
time allow the telescope to live up to its highly publicized promise. But what 
if they fail? 
</P>
<P>
"We won't get a second chance," Trauger said, because costs and political 
pressures would probably preclude ever trying again. 
</P>
<P>
"There's going to be a lot of reputations on the line," he added. 
</P>
<P>
James Westphal of Caltech, who labored 13 years as the project scientist on the 
camera now rendered useless, agrees that if the wizards of JPL, aided by scores 
of experts across the country, are unsuccessful, the telescope will probably be 
regarded as one of the space program's most spectacular embarrassments. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a total disaster," Westphal said. 
</P>
<P>
Westphal, Trauger and the teams that will be working with them during the 
coming months must try to resolve a problem they did not create. There is 
nothing wrong with the camera that is aboard the telescope. 
</P>
<P>
The mirrors serve the same function as a telephoto lens used by photographers 
on Earth. But it doesn't make any difference how good the camera is if the 
telephoto lens itself is flawed. 
</P>
<P>
Experts at JPL will spend the next two months studying images from the 
telescope to see if they can equip a new camera with corrective lenses to cure 
the Hubble's fuzzy vision. 
</P>
<P>
Modifications to an upgraded camera that the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration had already planned to add to the telescope in 1993 could 
correct the flaw by deliberately introducing errors that would offset those 
caused by the faulty mirror. In this case, two wrongs could make a right. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists are looking for help from the technical record dating back to 
the period, nearly a decade ago, when the telescope's mirrors were under 
construction at Perkin-Elmer Corp. in Danbury, Conn. Perkin-Elmer, which was 
acquired about a year ago by Hughes Aircraft and renamed Hughes Danbury Optical 
Systems Inc., is one of the world's leading manufacturers of precision optics. 
But somehow during the fabrication of the mirrors for the Hubble, something 
went terribly wrong. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that in the records of the manufacturing and testing of the mirrors 
some clue will be found: some slight error in the formula for the curvature of 
the mirrors or some piece of faulty equipment. That would make the job a lot 
easier. A committee set up by NASA is looking for clues, but a lot can happen 
over the years to cloud the record. 
</P>
<P>
For now, scientists must assume that they have to solve the problem themselves 
by carefully analyzing images from the telescope, in hopes of pinpointing the 
nature of the flaw and exactly where it is in the complex optical system. 
</P>
<P>
Trauger and others suspect that the flaw lies in the telescope's primary 
mirror. The huge piece of glass had to be polished to the highest degree of 
precision ever. Making the job more difficult, the primary mirror in the 
telescope is not shaped like a sphere, which would be easier to grind. It is a 
parabola, which means the shape changes according to the distance from the 
center so that it can focus all the light falling on its entire surface on a 
single point. 
</P>
<P>
As the grinding wheel moves out from the center, it has to constantly change 
its position according to mathematical formulas that will give the mirror its 
correct shape. Most experts theorize that -- possibly because of something as 
simple as a typographical error -- the mirror flattens out slightly toward its 
outer edge. Light striking that area would be scattered over the focal plane 
instead of concentrating at the center, producing a fuzzy image. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are analyzing scores of images from the Hubble to see if they reveal 
the nature of the flaw. The images the scientists are producing consist of 
computer graphics, not celestial photographs, designed to help diagnose the 
problem. The amount of light falling on the camera's electronic "eye" is 
measured and simulated on a computer, producing the graphic. 
</P>
<P>
If the telescope was working properly, the light would be concentrated at the 
center of the image and appear as a spike on the computer monitor. The spike 
would rise from a flat base because all the light would be focused on a single 
point. 
</P>
<P>
But a flawed optical system produces a spike rising from a turbulent base, 
looking like a mountain peak rising from a series of foothills, because some of 
the light is diffused. Buried in the hills and valleys at the base of the peak 
is the secret of Hubble's problem. 
</P>
<P>
If they can figure out the nature of the flaw, the scientists will create a 
computer image of a celestial target as it should appear. Then they will point 
the telescope at the target and see if they get the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
They will do that over and over until they are confident they have isolated the 
flaw. Once they know exactly what it is, Trauger said, new lenses can be built 
for the second-generation camera. 
</P>
<P>
"If you give us an error, we can fix it," he said. "But first we have to know 
what it is." 
</P>
<P>
For the next two or three months, scientists will grapple with understanding 
the precise nature of the flaw. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody said it would be easy," Trauger said. 
</P>
<P>
If they succeed, the only thing left will be to fly the new camera up to the 
telescope aboard the space shuttle, put it on and hope nothing else goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
By then, perhaps, NASA will have figured out what gremlin caused the problem in 
the first place. The space agency is struggling to explain how such an error 
could have gone undetected and the telescope could have been launched with a 
flawed optical system. 
</P>
<P>
There were many tests, by both Perkin-Elmer and NASA, aimed at preventing just 
this sort of thing from happening, and many scientists are astounded that the 
error could have slipped through. 
</P>
<P>
The mirrors were tested independently, not as a single optical system, because 
testing them together would have been so expensive and time-consuming that it 
was considered impractical. It would have been necessary to have built a huge 
structure and several other lenses to the same precise standards as the 
telescope to detect any errors. 
</P>
<P>
Those tests, NASA officials insist, would have cost at least $100 million, 
probably much more. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the record clearly shows that in the early 1980s, executives at the 
space agency had great faith in Perkin-Elmer's performance, despite the fact 
that the project was running months behind schedule and cost overruns were 
soaring. 
</P>
<P>
James M. Beggs, then NASA's administrator, testified before a congressional 
committee in 1983 that the company was six months behind and slipping further. 
He was asked to explain why NASA had given Perkin-Elmer $2.5 million in "award 
fees" despite what one congressman called "a very poor technical performance." 
</P>
<P>
"Because the award fee was based on the technical progress that they had 
demonstrated," Beggs testified. "They had also delivered a mirror that exceeded 
specifications. They had also done an above-average job in our judgment on the 
remainder of the optics. In short, on that part of the job, they have performed 
superbly." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the overruns, Perkin-Elmer continued to receive bonus payments. 
According to a 1989 NASA inspector general's audit, the contractor was awarded 
$6 million through April, 1987. If NASA had fully considered the cost overruns, 
the bonuses could have been reduced by $1 million, the audit said.

Solving The Hubble's Problems 
</P>
<P>
To solve the problems of the ailing Hubble Space Telescope, scientists and 
engineers at the JetPropulsion Laboratory will have to rely heavily upon 
computer graphics that they hope will reveal what is wrong with the telescope's 
optics. The chart on the left shows how light from a distant star should appear 
in a computer graphic-as a single peak rising from a flat base-if the telescope 
were working correctly. But because of a flaw in the telescope's mirrors, the 
peak of starlight rises from a hilly surface (right). The hills at the base of 
the peak result from light that cannot be focused because of the optical flaws, 
and they would make the star appear fuzzy. By studing the "hills" at the base 
of the peak, the scientists hope to correctly analyze the flaws in the optical 
system and add correcting lenses to a new camera that will be attached to the 
telescope in about three years.
