<P>
The globe on your bookshelf was never like the GeoSphere. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of man-imposed borders and artificially colored countries, there's a 
picture-perfect, remarkably detailed, cloudless image of the Earth's land 
masses and oceans, pretty much as they appear from space. 
</P>
<P>
As the globe rotates, light from an artificial sun throws some continents into 
shadows or "night," and then tiny optic fibers wink on to mark the light show 
of the world's major cities after dark. 
</P>
<P>
The image is a complex mosaic, created over the last year and a half, of 
thousands of satellite photos pieced together by a team of artists, computer 
experts and scientists under the direction of Santa Monica artist Tom Van Sant. 
He financed the project first with a $30,000 grant from the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, then by using the proceeds from the sale 
of his Los Feliz home, then by stretching his credit to the breaking point. 
</P>
<P>
Computer-graphics experts from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena joined 
Van Sant's team, mostly in their spare time, to create the technology that made 
the image possible. Before they were finished, they had not only invented 
methods for Van Sant to correct color distortions in satellite pictures but 
also devised a program that permitted Van Sant to see through the clouds that 
perpetually blanket parts of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The "globe" the team produced could revolutionize the globe industry when it 
enters the market, as early as next year, says Jon Hultman, an executive with 
Replogle Globes Inc., an Illinois-based firm and major globe manufacturer. 
Hultman is negotiating distribution rights to Van Sant's creation, which may be 
the biggest thing in globes since the 1950s, when bumps were placed on them to 
symbolize mountain chains. 
</P>
<P>
For Van Sant, the project is more than the realization of an artistic dream. 
It's a necessity, he says, a potential cure for mankind's predilection for 
failing to treat the Earth as a fragile, organism-like entity. 
</P>
<P>
"The Earth is like a person," he says. "You might not appreciate how much you 
would be affected if something happened to a small part of you, like your big 
toe. But everything is connected, interrelated." An untreated infection in one 
small place could imperil the entire organism, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant says the GeoSphere can make this point forcefully. GeoSphere 
technology can go beyond creating what its makers call a "reality image" of the 
Earth. The technology has the potential to generate computer pictures of the 
Earth, past and future. 
</P>
<P>
Such projections already exist in the form of tables and charts, the dialect of 
scientists. The purpose of a three-dimensional globe is to translate scientific 
data into a picture that can be understood by policy-makers and ordinary 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"If the World Bank is deciding whether to support dam building or a 
deforestation project in the Amazon, they are not now able to see all the 
ramifications of this decision," Van Sant says. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, GeoSphere technology will be able to project "what the Amazon 
region looked like in 1972, 1982, and show what it looks like in 1990," Van 
Sant says. "With risk projection, we can show what the rain forests will look 
like in 2010 given the same rate of deforestation." 
</P>
<P>
"Earth-resource studies and Earth sciences are no longer territory for 
scientific inquiry alone," he says. "They are essential ingredients in the 
formation of public policy." 
</P>
<P>
It makes perfect sense for an artist to be heading a scientific project with 
that goal, Van Sant says. "Artists are tremendously needed in the world of 
technology to be able to take these issues and communicate them effectively." 
Besides, he says, "I'm comfortable with large things." 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant has crossed between art and science before. In 1980, he placed 
sunlight-reflecting mirrors in the Mojave Desert to overexpose picture panels 
in a satellite passing overhead. The overexposure created what appeared to be a 
drawing of a giant eye, about 2.5 kilometers across, or 100,000 times the size 
of a human eye. 
</P>
<P>
And, he's used a stream of electrons to etch a microscopic eye, 100,000 times 
smaller than normal, into the side of a salt crystal. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant, 59, has also produced more traditional art -- paintings, murals and 
sculptures -- all across Southern California. The former Marine and Korean War 
veteran has supported himself as an artist since earning a master's degree in 
fine arts in 1957 from the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant has accepted virtually no commissions, however, since March, 1989, 
when an eye infection after a cornea transplant nearly blinded him. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that could save my eyes was the administration of five 
different antibiotics in my eyes every half-hour for 10 days," he recalls. 
"That's a treatment that made everyone crazy, even the nurses. I emptied my 
mind of all thought and resided there for 10 days. When that period was over, 
the GeoSphere made a choice on me. Nothing else would reside in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
But single-mindedness was no substitute for technical expertise. That's why Van 
Sant called JPL's Van Warren, who had put together a cruder computer-assisted 
Earth mosaic on his own. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to see the Earth as it looked from space," Warren says. "We 
pay so much attention to other planets, why not pay attention to our own 
planet? It is what affects us most of the time." 
</P>
<P>
JPL agreed to release Warren for four months to work with Van Sant, who used 
his own money to purchase a $200,000 advanced graphics computer. Overall, the 
artist, who lives in a Santa Monica garage apartment with his 8-year-old son, 
estimates that he's invested about $350,000 in the project. 
</P>
<P>
For months, the GeoSphere team labored in a dark, creaky, converted garage in 
Pasadena. Between them, Van Sant and Warren painstakingly pored over about five 
years of satellite data and aerial photography bought or borrowed from 
government storage facilities. The goal was to find at least one cloud-free 
satellite picture of every section of land and water. From these, Van Sant 
could use Warren's computer program to assemble a single mosaic-style picture 
of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Some areas, such as parts of the Amazon, the Congo and southern New Zealand, 
were always covered with clouds. Enter JPL's Jim Knighton, who had purchased 
charts and tables, originally compiled by the CIA, describing various rivers 
and coastlines. Even before he met Van Sant, Knighton, who has now become the 
project's technical director, had been using computer graphics to convert these 
data into picture form. 
</P>
<P>
The image remained seriously flawed, however, because the colors -- coded by 
scientists concerned with such topics as surface temperature and infrared 
radiation -- were wrong. Heavily forested areas, for instance, typically came 
out red instead of green. Van Sant says they looked like raw meat. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Blume, another computer-graphics consultant who then worked for JPL, 
designed a program to correct the colors. 
</P>
<P>
At every turn, Van Sant could move forward with the mosaic only after his 
technical team created a computer medium within which he could work. It was as 
if da Vinci had to keep the "Mona Lisa" on hold while his colleagues struggled 
to invent the paintbrush. 
</P>
<P>
The image that emerged is not quite a photo, though it looks like one. Surface 
features in perpetually cloud-covered areas were traced in through computer 
graphics and colored as they would appear. Green areas were made a little 
greener, to compensate for natural factors that convert green to a dull brown 
when viewed from space. Other surface features, such as rivers, were enhanced 
to make them more visible. 
</P>
<P>
The team says its computer image, finished in April, is one of the largest and 
most complex ever assembled. It contains well over 37 million pixels. Each 
pixel is an individually controlled dot of color that makes up part of the 
image. And every pixel had about 15 sets of data behind it. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of its sheer enormity," Warren says, "I did feel at times like a 
bricklayer." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution enables Van Sant to show any object on the surface that's four 
kilometers -- about 4,400 yards -- or larger, although a person might need a 
powerful magnifying glass to see it. Next, Van Sant would like to try for a 
one-kilometer resolution, which would require four times the amount of 
information and render objects as small as airports distinguishable. 
</P>
<P>
In Van Sant's computer, the Earth appears on a monitor and will turn or rotate 
on command. The computer program can zoom in on any designated geographic 
location, such as the Nile River. Van Sant eventually hopes JPL's Knighton can 
package this software for home computers. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant says an inexpensive home globe for families and classrooms is also 
just around the corner. Ideally, that globe would include a variety of snap-on 
accessories, to show political boundaries, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Van Sant has lined up vendors to sell poster versions of his 
GeoSphere image. Just in time, Van Sant says, noting he's come near the end of 
his savings and credit. "The universe is looking after us," he said.
