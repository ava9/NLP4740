For the first time, the spacecraft Voyager has detected intense radio signals 
coming from Neptune, revealing that the planet has a magnetic field and 
indicating that next week's close encounter will be as intriguing as scientists 
had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery suggests that the spacecraft will find a wide range of 
interesting phenomena as it passes close to the distant planet Thursday night, 
including the kind of auroral activity that produces the northern and southern 
lights on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The signals were first detected last Monday, but scientists at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory were not sure they were coming from Neptune, according to 
James Warwick, principal investigator on the planetary radio astronomy 
experiment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not What Was Expected 
</P>
<P>
"Their character was different than what we were expecting," Warwick said. 
</P>
<P>
"The radio emissions are very intense," Warwick said, adding that they came in 
short, powerful bursts over a limited frequency range. Scientists had expected 
radio signals from Neptune, but they were looking for something less intense 
and less limited in frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
Warwick and fellow scientists working on the project decided to announce the 
discovery Friday after they grew more confident of what they were seeing. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery means Neptune has a strong magnetic field because radio waves are 
generated by charged particles that become trapped in the magnetic field and 
spiral into the planet's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
It is the same process that produces the northern lights on Earth. Charged 
particles from space flow along the Earth's magnetic field lines and into the 
atmosphere at either the North or South Pole, producing the celestial fireworks 
over the higher latitudes. Now, Voyager is expected to see the same thing at 
Neptune. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Within 3,000 Miles 
</P>
<P>
The Voyager spacecraft, which will make its fourth and final planetary flyby 
next week when it passes within about 3,000 miles of Neptune's cloud tops, used 
a radio receiver and a giant pair of "rabbit ears" to detect the radio 
emissions -- just as it did at Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. Each 33-foot-long 
ear scans a series of frequencies and, since they work separately, the 
"polarization," or vibration, of the signals can be determined, thus 
distinguishing between radio signals generated by lightning and those created 
by a magnetic field. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we are dealing with a magnetic field," Warwick said. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of a magnetic field also tells scientists something about the 
interior of Neptune. The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of 
its molten iron core, and Neptune's strong magnetic field suggests that Neptune 
also has a region of fluid in its interior. 
</P>
<P>
Venus, Mars and probably Pluto do not have magnetic fields. 
</P>
<P>
Early analysis of the data from Voyager indicates that Neptune's magnetic field 
is similar in intensity to Earth's. 
</P>
<P>
As more and more data is collected on the magnetic field, scientists will be 
able to determine more precisely the length of a Neptunian day -- the time it 
takes for one rotation. That is believed to be about 18 hours, but by the time 
Voyager is through that figure should be known exactly. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, scientists have known little about Neptune other than such things as 
its atmospheric composition, which includes the methane that makes it appear 
blue. But Voyager will pass right over the planet's north pole, and that is 
fortuitous for scientists who are interested in its magnetic field. That 
trajectory will carry it through the intense field where charged particles are 
being funneled into the polar atmosphere, and that should reveal much about the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, by the time Voyager zips past Neptune it will have collected enough 
data for scientists to learn more about its magnetic field than any other 
planet except Earth.
