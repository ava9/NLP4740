Only four months after the Guatemalan government and left-wing guerrillas
signed a human rights agreement, violations have increased. The United
Nations has also yet to install a monitoring mission as stipulated in the
accord.
Political killings, disappearances and kidnappings have doubled in the first
six months of this year compared to the equivalent period in 1993, according
to the Roman Catholic Church's human rights office.
Sightings of tortured bodies on the streets of Guatemala City are becoming
more frequent, and the army has continued to recruit youths forcibly in
rural areas, violating last March's agreement.
Bureaucratic delays at the UN have stalled the deployment of a mission to
verify the application of the agreement, say officials, despite a reported
commitment by the UN to set up a mission by the end of June.
The guerrillas of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity thought they
had won a small victory by insisting on immediate UN verification in the
face of long-standing opposition from the powerful Guatemalan army.
They have now threatened to suspend talks. 'If the minimum conditions
established in the Global Agreement on Human Rights are not met, it is not
possible to continue in a process of negotiation,' they said in a statement
in national newspapers last week.
The delay has led to complaints by local human rights groups that the
international community appears more concerned about keeping to a tight
agenda to end the conflict than in fostering the conditions for lasting
peace where basic rights are respected.
'They are only interested in a ceasefire, not in seeing a resolution of the
substantive issues which are considered to have originated and fuelled the
armed conflict,' says Monsignor Rodolfo Quesada, a former peace mediator.
The two sides who have been negotiating an end to the 33-year civil war for
three years agreed in January on a timetable to sign a final peace agreement
in December. Since then they have made strong advances, most recently in
Oslo last month when they agreed on the establishment of a 'truth
commission' to document human rights violations.
But the commission has been criticised as merely symbolic by human rights
activists, including the Nobel Peace Prize-winner Ms Rigoberta Menchu,
because it will fall short of naming individuals responsible for abuses, and
will not provide a moral sanction. Its role will merely be to document
events.
About 150,000 people have died in Guatemala's internal conflict, mostly
killed by the security forces, according to human rights groups.
Sources close to the talks say the guerrillas were extremely reluctant to
agree to a commission with such small teeth, but were overwhelmed by
pressure from the UN and the international community.
