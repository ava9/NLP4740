<TEXT>
<P>
A 41-year-old lawyer from a prominent political family took over as president 
today in the long shadow of Oscar Arias Sanchez, who thrust this country into 
the global spotlight with his regional peace efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Incoming President Rafael Calderon Fournier acknowledged his predecessor's 
international renown but said he will concentrate on internal affairs -- 
without giving short shrift to foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Arias spearheaded Central American peace efforts that promoted democracy and 
sought an end to civil wars. He won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for drafting a 
regional peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
Although originally thrilled with Arias' fame, many Costa Ricans have now come 
to feel that he gained it at their expense -- by ignoring domestic problems. 
Even so, he leaves office with an approval rating of 90%.
