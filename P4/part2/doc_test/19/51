The U.N. trade embargo is depriving Iraqi civilians, including children, of 
critically needed medical supplies, a U.S. doctor who recently toured the 
region said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We found that sanctions are working, and working brutally, right now," Dr. 
Bernard Lown of the Harvard University School of Public Health said in an 
interview on NBC-TV's "Today" program. 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad hospitals, including pediatric hospitals, lack insulin, intravenous 
solution and injectable forms of other antibiotics and anesthestics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. sanctions, imposed after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, 
allow trade in medicine and some foodstuffs. 
</P>
<P>
Lown is co-president of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear 
War, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985.
