FT  12 SEP 92 / US election is Clinton's to lose: Jurek Martin assesses the
first week of the presidential campaign proper

A SENIOR adviser to Mr Bill Clinton, speaking delicately off the record this
week, said: 'I'm sure George Bush can't win this election now, but we can
still lose it.' This assessment would probably find agreement, also
unattributably, in the Bush campaign. The first week of what might be
described as the home stretch of the campaign, beginning on Labour Day last
Monday, offered plenty of hints as to the tactics of both sides.
Two issues dominated the week - the economy and the truthfulness of both
candidates. On the first, there is a universal assumption that the economy
itself cannot come to Mr Bush's rescue. If the third quarter GNP returns, to
be announced a week before election day, show growth at less than 1 per
cent, as may happen and as the Clinton camp, looking for last-minute
ammunition, not so secretly hopes, then that will put the seal on what is
already evident.
It explains why the thrust of President Bush's economic address in Detroit
on Thursday was all about the future. It was also couched in general terms
except for its explicit linkage of US performance to the growth of the
global economy and free trade. Mr Bush said afterwards this was the most
important aspect of his speech.
It was, in essence, an attempt to turn weakness into strength. Never mind
the present, Mr Bush was saying, your future is in better hands with a man
who understands the global picture than with one who would merely impose
bigger domestic government and higher taxes.
It did not exactly help the presentation that the White House made an awful
hash of clarifying one of the president's more strident promises on
Wednesday - not to raise taxes 'ever, ever', a phrase that will surely haunt
him in the weeks ahead as much as his 1988 'read my lips, no new taxes'.
But at least Mr Bush was saying something positive about the economy. His
surrogates were also saying a lot of negative things about Mr Clinton's
character, specifically his not always consistent explanations of how he
avoided military service, and this, in turn, puts the Democratic candidate's
team on the spot.
It wants the debate to remain firmly focused on the economy. This is what Mr
Clinton spent a lot of the week doing, talking about how 'to end welfare as
we know it' - through a Dollars 24bn four-year programme of tax credits and
private and community sector employment - and about retraining, particularly
in the defence industry. His campaign is convinced the electorate wants to
hear what precise policies are in store, always a Clinton strength.
Some advisers think that to counter Mr Bush's incessant labelling of their
candidate as a man who enjoys increasing taxes, much more should be heard of
his proposals to lower them on the middle classes and about how he would
reduce the federal deficit, on which he is said privately to be an economic
hawk.
But that is not their great fear. Their fear is that he will be sidetracked,
as he was briefly this week, into a slanging match, fending off charges
about the draft with counterblasts at Mr Bush's alleged involvement in
Iran-Contra and the re-arming of Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The concern here is
twofold: that to engage in such exchanges will only highlight Mr Clinton's
character and the suspicion that past foreign entanglements by the president
do not really interest the public. Absent a smoking gun, neither Iraq nor
Iran-gate yet equals Watergate; lying to Congress is widely seen as routine.
The Bush week, in both its positive and negative respects and excepting the
tax pledge mess, bore all the hallmarks of Mr James Baker, now in full
control of the campaign. Mr David Broder, austere political columnist of the
Washington Post, complained bitterly that it was typically Bakeresque that
'the public must lose its chance to hear a serious discussion about the
nation's future'.
Mr Baker certainly seemed to have put an end to a lot of presidential talk
about traditional family values, a non-winner according to all the polls. It
was surprising, therefore, that Mr Bush took himself off to Virginia last
night for a speech to the Rev Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition, which
thinks that gays of both sexes are conspiring with liberal perverts to
undermine the nation's moral fibre. Mr Robertson, however, might be good at
getting out the conservative vote.
The final Baker touch, so irksome to Mr Broder, was his prevarication over
the format of the upcoming presidential debates. The suspicion is that he
does not want Mr Bush exposed to a one-on-one with Mr Clinton in the
presence of a single self-effacing moderator but would prefer the presence
of grandstanding journalists asking outlandish 'character' questions because
they pose a greater potential threat to Mr Clinton.
There will be two or three debates in the end, because Mr Bush needs them.
Ms Elaine Kamarck, who advises Mr Clinton, probably got it right when she
said the announcement of debates tended to turn the public off the campaign
in the days before they take place. Mr Baker, she pointed out, needed to
keep Mr Bush moving, and on the offensive, all the time. Freezing opinion
with him ten points behind did not make sense. Such was not the
characteristic of the first week. With both candidates invoking President
Harry Truman at every turn, it hardly could have been.
