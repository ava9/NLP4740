IT WOULD, sadly, be rather appropriate if President Bush's term of office
were to end in one more confrontation with Iraq - a decisive victory for the
US in purely military terms, yet inconclusive and unsatisfying politically.
For the presidency as a whole, in retrospect, has something of that quality:
a period in which the US reacted to world events with competence and
firmness, yet failed to implement, or even to articulate, a broader
political strategy.
The conventional wisdom is that Mr Bush was successful in foreign policy,
but paid the political price for neglecting the domestic economy. Seen from
a distance, however, his economic management rates at least a beta plus,
while his foreign policy looks uninspired.
His competence and professionalism are not in dispute, and indeed compare
favourably with those of his immediate predecessors. Yet it is arguably not
with them but with Harry S Truman that he should be compared, because no
president since Truman has been presented with quite such dramatic
challenges.
He did act with admirable steadiness in insisting that Germany could and
must be reunited within Nato; and in ensuring that the break-up of the
Soviet Union was not accompanied by loss of control over its nuclear
weapons. But he never seemed to grasp how much was at stake in the heroic
attempt of Russians and other east Europeans, after decades of communist
oppression and mismanagement, to adopt market economics and liberal
democracy.
Shared criticism
No doubt any simple transposition of the Marshall Plan model would have been
inappropriate. No doubt in the 1990s the US could reasonably expect a much
greater share of the economic burden to be borne by its allies. Certainly
any criticisms of Mr Bush have to be addressed in equal or greater measure
to the leaders of Europe, whose interest in the matter was more obvious and
direct. Even so, the transformation of eastern Europe called for a western
effort of solidarity on the Marshall Plan scale, not just in financial terms
but in imagination and leadership; and the US president was the person best
placed to provide such leadership. It cannot honestly be said that he did
so.
The new circumstances also required a reforging of Atlantic ties, which
could no longer be taken for granted in the absence of the Soviet threat.
The US secretary of state did call for such a reforging in December 1989. If
nothing much has come of it, that is as much the Europeans' fault as Mr
Bush's. The latter at least appreciated the importance of an open trading
regime with rules accepted by all parties. Yet, without in any way excusing
the near-paralysis of the European Community, it must be asked whether he
really gave this issue the priority it deserved.
Withdrawn slogan
He will be remembered as the leader of the coalition that reversed Iraq's
annexation of Kuwait, giving a new authority to the UN Security Council, and
as the man who proclaimed a 'new world order' in 1990, only to withdraw the
slogan a year later. He has been ready to exploit some of the opportunities
offered by the absence of a global rival, deploying US military force to
impose a minimum of international order in the Middle East and, more
recently, a minimum of civil order in Somalia. But these actions have been
reactive, and carefully limited in time and scope.
They have been accompanied, too, by repeated assertions that the US cannot
and will not act as the world's policeman. Yet that, it seems, is a role the
US cannot wholly avoid. It needs to be institutionalised and
multilateralised. The US should not have to bear the whole burden, but
equally it cannot expect always to be in command; nor can it continue to
treat the UN as essentially a diplomatic convenience.
The windows of opportunity that opened in 1989 have not yet banged shut, but
many may be close to doing so. The American people have denied Mr Bush a
second term, sensing perhaps that he lacks the stature for such a unique
historical moment. They have elected a younger, more glamorous and more
articulate president, who is not the first to declare the domestic economy
his main priority. He may find, like others before him, that he is
ultimately judged by his success or failure in discharging America's
international responsibilities.
