MONDAY
John Major at Scott inquiry
John Major, the hard-pressed UK prime minister (left), joins the growing
line of officials and government ministers required to give evidence in
public to Lord Justice Scott's arms-for-Iraq inquiry.
Mr Major set up the inquiry himself in November 1992 in response to the row
over alleged government complicity in the illegal arms sales. He was foreign
secretary and chancellor of the exchequer under Lady Thatcher.
The European Parliament holds its first full session of the year. The 518
deputies will be preparing nervously in Strasbourg for June's Euroelection,
likely to be dominated as much by domestic issues in the 12 member states as
by pan-European themes.
Textile squabble: The US is due to cut China's textile and clothing import
quotas by more than Dollars 1bn for alleged cheating. The Clinton
administration says China has tried to skirt limits by shipping goods into
the US through other nations.
Mercosur summit: The presidents of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay,
the four countries which will make up the planned Mercosur free trade area,
are due to meet in Uruguay. Mercosur is planned to come into effect next
year, but some matters are undecided, for example, a common external tariff.
Lloyd's offer: Names on Gooda Walker and Feltrim syndicates - two of the
biggest loss makers at Lloyd's of London - meet this week to discuss the
Pounds 900m offer to settle litigation at the insurance market. Both groups
are likely to reject the deal, making their disputes dependent on legal
cases coming to court later this year. In these, Names are suing their
agents for alleged negligence.
Gooda Names, who meet today, have been offered Pounds 223m, compared with a
claim of Pounds 580m. Names have until February 14 to vote on the package.
Thorp licence: The licence for the Pounds 2.8bn Thorp nuclear reprocessing
plant at Sellafield, north-west England, comes into effect. The plant will
not be fully operational for another month, while preliminary tests
continue. In early February, the government faces a legal challenge on its
decision to grant the licence from Greenpeace, the environmental pressure
group, and Lancashire County Council who are worried about emissions.
Holidays: US federal government offices and banks will be closed for Martin
Luther King day.
TUESDAY
Patten consults in London
Chris Patten, the governor of Hong Kong, leaves for London for a series of
meetings with British ministers about the colony's political development. It
is expected that the governor will seek approval to push ahead with his
original democracy proposals in the form of a second bill to be put to Hong
Kong's legislature in March.
On Thursday, he will appear before the foreign affairs select committee of
the House of Commons. The committee is preparing a report on Anglo-
Chinese relations.
Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, who is on a trip to Asia, arrives
in Thailand. He is expected to call for an opening of the Thai financial and
services sector to more foreign competition.
Burmese constitution: The country's national convention is due to sit. It
mostly comprises delegates hand-picked by the military junta and is charged
with drafting a new constitution. It may feel its hand has been strengthened
now the Karen, one of the regime's main opponents, have decided to hold
peace talks.
Bosnia negotiations resume: The leaders of Bosnia's three warring
communities will resume partition talks in Geneva under the international
mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg.
Last week, Nato renewed warnings that the Serbs would risk air strikes if
they blocked the opening of the airport in Tuzla, the biggest Moslem
stronghold. Hope for a settlement is slim. Bosnian prime minister Haris
Silajdzic (above) has said that if the Serb shelling of Sarajevo does not
stop, his delegation will stay away.
Aluminium smeltdown: Trade representatives from the world's leading
aluminium-producing countries meet in Brussels with industry representatives
to consider ways of reducing global surpluses of the metal. This might lead
to co-ordinated cuts in production.
UK trade survey: The monthly distributive trade survey from the
Confederation of British Industry should give the first insight in retail
trade over Christmas and the New Year.
Media reports and anecdotal evidence point to a spending spree in late
December, although this may have been exaggerated by focusing on the
hitherto depressed south. Official figures on Wednesday will provide further
details of retail trading in December.
WEDNESDAY
Crunch-time for Hosokawa
In a decisive week for Japan's prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa, his ruling
coalition is trying to get parliament's upper house to vote on the four
political and electoral reform bills in a plenary session. This is the final
stage before they become law.
Procedural delays and splits in its own camp have forced the coalition to
aim for a vote in the upper house political reform committee mid-week,
paving the way for a plenary vote by Friday. Hosokawa is expected to succeed
in the end by a narrow margin. If he fails to get agreement by January 29,
the end of the extended parliamentary session, he may resign.
Bentsen in Beijing: US treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen is due in the
Chinese capital. At a meeting of the US-China joint economic committee, he
is expected to discuss China's economic reforms, opening up its markets, and
US concerns about human rights. On Friday, he travels to Shanghai.
Allies in Ankara:
British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd visits the Turkish capital for talks
with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller (left). Tomorrow he is joined by his German
counterpart Klaus Kinkel. The Turks' European partners will try to reassure
them that the Greek accession to the presidency of the European Union will
not upset Turkey's plans to deepen its trade and political relations with
Brussels.
Theodoros Pangalos, Greece's deputy foreign minister, outlines to MEPs in
Strasbourg his government's priorities for the EU presidency during the next
six months.
Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, is expected to convene a strategy
session on the economy to try to find a way to reduce unemployment.
Ungagged: The Irish government's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army terrorist organisation, is due
to lapse.
UK retail price index: Budget increases in tobacco, petrol and vehicle
excise duties are set to push up inflation. The headline rate for December
is expected to rise from November's 1.4 per cent year-on-year rate to about
2 per cent, which would be the highest level since December 1992.
Forecasters expect only a modest upturn in underlying inflation, which
excludes mortgage interest payments, to 2.7 per cent last month, from 2.5
per cent in November.
THURSDAY
Bundesbank ponders rates
The Bundesbank council holds its regular fortnightly meeting. The German
central bank has not cut interest rates so far this year. Although money
supply growth may be abating, the recent weakness of the D-Mark has added to
uncertainty over the timing of German monetary easing.
The Bank of England will announce the terms of its first extended repo and
secured loan facilities to provide funds to the UK banking system to
February 10 and to February 24. The move is a step towards liberalising the
London money market.
South African elections: The African National Congress publishes its
official list of candidates for the April 27 elections, delayed from Tuesday
because of computer problems.
President FW de Klerk opens the National party election campaign with a trip
to Northwest Province.
Ukraine's parliament convenes:
Ukraine's parliament, the rada, reconvenes for its last session before
elections in March. Many of its members have already voiced their opposition
to the accord signed by President Leonid Kravchuk in Moscow last Friday
under which Ukraine is to eliminate its nuclear missiles over the next three
years.
This will be their first chance to attempt to derail the deal described by
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia as 'putting the last full stop in the last
chapter of the cold war'.
Vietnam's Communist party is scheduled to hold a special conference that has
been delayed from December. The party is expected to discuss the successes
and problems of economic reform (to Jan 24). There may be a leadership
reshuffle.
Inman takes charge:
Bobby Ray Inman is due to take over as US secretary of defense. Inman will
be the first former career officer to serve as secretary of defense since
General George Marshall, who held the office under President Harry Truman.
Inman also has the distinction of having voted for George Bush in the
election won by President Clinton.
FRIDAY
Belgian Guy to face music
Belgium's political establishment continues its painful self-examination
about allegations of bribery and corruption relating to the award of a
helicopter contract to Agusta, the Italian aircraft manufacturer.
Today, a special committee of the Belgian parliament is expected to question
Guy Coeme, deputy prime minister, and the most senior of three
French-speaking Socialist politicians. The magistrate investigating the
affair wants to examine them. All three have denied any wrongdoing and
opposed calls for their parliamentary immunity to be lifted.
Lloyd's meeting: Names belonging to Lloyd's of London loss-making Feltrim
syndicate meet to discuss the offer to settle litigation at the insurance
market. They have been offered Pounds 237m, just under 40 per cent of their
total claim.
Turkey's president Suleyman Demirel attends a summit of Turkic republics in
Baku, Azerbaijan (to Jan 22). Turkey hopes its cultural ties will help it
increase trade with and influence in central Asia.
WEEKEND
Venezuela congress meets
Venezuela's congress, elected last month, on Sunday begins its five-year
term. In a sharp break with the country's democratic history, the two
parties which have long dominated politics - Democratic Action (AD) and the
Social Christian Copei party - will be forced to share power with other
blocs. President-elect Rafael Caldera will thus be hard-pressed to put
together a majority.
ANC policy conference: The African National Congress, widely expected to
play a leading role in South Africa's government after April's election,
debates its future policy at an economic reconstruction conference.
Party in Weimar: Manfred Brunner, founds a German anti-Maastricht party in
Weimar on Sunday to contest this year's European election. Mr Brunner, an
outspoken opponent of the Maastricht treaty, took the government to the
constitutional court last year in a bid to have the treaty thrown out.
