 -Twenty years on, ending of the trade embargo has closed a chapter

American presidents sometimes act out of character when occasion demands.
Harry Truman, suspected of isolationism, launched the Marshall Plan and Nato
to put war-shattered Europe back on its feet; Richard Nixon and Ronald
Reagan, cold war warriors both, opened improbable avenues of co-operation
and communication with China and the former Soviet Union respectively.
By these historical standards, there is something both consistent and
logical in Bill Clinton's drawing of a line under the Vietnam War by his
decision last night to end the trade embargo. This is a president, after
all, who never served in uniform and, as a young man, publicly opposed the
war. There was even a time early in the 1992 campaign when, because of his
evasion of the draft, it seemed he might become its latest victim, nearly 20
years after military hostilities had ceased.
Yet so powerful are the emotions still stirred by the only war the US can
definitively be said to have 'lost' in 200 years that Mr Clinton did not
rush into normalising relations with Vietnam. Instead he carefully built up
political constituencies at home and patiently followed the general road map
laid out by George Bush, another president who, in the first flushes of
victory after the Gulf War, must surely have been tempted also to come to
terms with Vietnam.
America's Vietnam casualty list is long indeed, since President John
Kennedy's fateful steps to contain the communist tide over 30 years ago. It
must begin with the 67,000-plus soldiers who never came home and the many
more who returned maimed in body and mind, the first returning US soldiers
not to be welcomed as conquering heroes.
It took many years, and more controversy, for their sacrifice finally to be
recognised in the shape of the Vietnam Memorial on the Washington Mall. It
is a recognition like no other - a long low dark gray wall etched with the
names of everyone who died - and its juxtaposition next to the heroic and
classical Lincoln Memorial speaks volumes.
The plight of the dead and the survivors is now embedded in popular culture,
recognised in films and books beyond number. Words and images from that era
still resonate - the 'domino theory,' Agent Orange, the Tet offensive, the
My Lai massacre and subsequent trial of Lt William Calley, the pictures of
the little Vietnamese girl burning from napalm, of the execution of a
captured Vietcong and of helicopters whirring above the US embassy in Saigon
as the last Americans were evacuated.
Few, if any, generations, have been so seared by a foreign conflict which
found the nation so divided. The chalice inherited by the 'best and the
brightest' in government, who flocked to Washington with Kennedy and mostly
stayed with Johnson, was poisoned.
Many tuned out and turned off, their contributions to society so much less
than they might have been. A few sought consolation in different forms of
public service - like Robert McNamara who, perhaps, salved his wounds and
guilt as defence secretary with two distinguished terms as president of the
World Bank. But he rarely spoke about Vietnam and only now is putting
together memoirs of the period.
Political victims abound. Lyndon Johnson, faced with turmoil in the streets
of Washington and around his country, decided not to run for re-election in
1968 and died, a broken man, three years later.
His Democratic party, under Hubert Humphrey, not only lost the presidency in
1968 but took years to come to terms with Vietnam, holding the White House
for only four of the next 24 years. In 1972, its presidential nomination was
captured by George McGovern, the anti-war candidate. He went down to an
landslide defeat to Richard Nixon, who, nevertheless, was not above
manipulating the Vietnam peace process on the eve of the election to
maximise his victory (he lost only liberal Massachusetts.)
Four years later, the Watergate scandal helped propel Jimmy Carter into the
White House but he, too, was afflicted by the Vietnam syndrome, this time in
Iran. A botched rescue attempt in the spring of 1980 of the US hostages in
Tehran came to seem pathetically indecisive when compared to Ronald Reagan's
blunt assertion that he would set 'a date certain' for release of the
hostages, in the absence of which US bombs would start falling.
Subsequent Republican presidents seemed to have learned this lesson better,
committing themselves to the doctrine of 'main force', winning little
victories in Grenada and Panama and a big one in the Gulf, and proclaiming
with each notch on the belt that the Vietnam nightmare was over and that US
forces would now be allowed by the politicians to win wars. But this did not
help George Bush in 1992.
Nor is it clear that their contention is valid. There is no evidence of
American appetite for foreign military adventure, be it in Bosnia, Somalia
or anywhere not incontrovertibly related to the national interest.
This may be ascribed to the end of the Cold War and the imperatives of
domestic renewal. But it may also be the real final legacy of Vietnam. 'No
more war' was a powerful chant in the streets of America in 1968. It would
still be so today.
