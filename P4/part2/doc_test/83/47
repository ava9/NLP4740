What books will Britain's chairmen and chief executives be taking on holiday
this summer, asks Charles Batchelor. Political biography, histories and
novels head the list. It will probably come as no surprise that management
volumes do not make the grade. Clear winners are John le Carre, with his spy
thriller The Night Manager, James Clavell's Gai-Jin, and Jeffrey Archer's
Honour Among Thieves. The most frequently mentioned title not quite to make
the holiday suitcase? Without a doubt Nigel Lawson's The View From No 11.
Many executives are 'wading through', or 'dipping into' it, but it appears
to be just too bulky to make the trip.
A bag of books, most of them 'hefty tomes', accompanies Sir Denys Henderson,
chairman of ICI. The subjects are mainly biographical but with what Sir
Denys calls 'faction' thrown in. He hopes to finish the Diaries of Alan
Clarke, the former defence minister, which he is already halfway through and
which he describes as a 'light read'. Next in line is Truman, a biography of
former US president Harry Truman by David McCullough, bought in a New York
bookshop. Lighter relief comes in the shape of Gai-Jin, James Clavell's
1,000-plus-page account of the European powers' attempts to open up
19th-century Japan.
'Good escapism' is the essential characteristic required by Ewen Macpherson,
chief executive of 3i, the UK's largest venture capital company, which has
made news in recent months with its on-off plans for a public flotation.
Macpherson will be taking Le Carre's The Night Manager and Jeffrey Archer's
Honour Among Thieves with him on his annual Scottish fishing break, where he
catches up on leisure reading. A book which has attracted his interest is
The View from No 11, Nigel Lawson's account of his years as chancellor of
the exchequer. 'I've been dipping in and out of it but I have not yet
settled down,' says Macpherson.
Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Postel, the UK's largest pension
fund, is a fan of the English classic novel, an enthusiasm he shares with
his wife. They like to choose a title jointly and discuss it afterwards,
with the characters fresh in their minds. Dickens's Hard Times is this
year's choice, perhaps an appropriate title for an investment manager at the
end of a deep recession. This will be joined by Fatherland, Robert Harris's
thriller set against the background of a victorious Third Reich. Ross Goobey
will also be taking John Carswell's South Sea Bubble, a recent reissue of
the story of the famous stock market scandal.
Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons Group, is methodical. He has selected
books in three categories - 'political history, popular stuff, and
mind-improving' - for his planned three-week break. Under the first category
he has selected John Campbell's Edward Heath, a biography, and Portraits and
Miniatures, by Roy Jenkins, a founder of the Social Democrats, whose style
he admires. The popular selection includes Jeffrey Archer's latest thriller,
Honour Among Thieves. In the mind-improving section, Kalms has set aside One
People, a study of the different strands in the Jewish community by Jonathan
Sachs, the chief rabbi.
Sir David Scholey, chairman of S G Warburg, the merchant banking group, says
he 'builds up a pile to be read and then see how far I can get through it'.
On his list is Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, which he last read as a schoolboy
and which a friend has recommended as a good guide to understanding what is
happening in Russia today. He has also chosen Le Carre's The Night Manager
for light relief. He looks forward to what he believes will be a 'splendidly
convoluted' tale. For a more factual account of recent history he has
selected Turmoil and Triumph, the memoirs of George Schultz, former US
secretary of state.
George Bain, principal of the London Business School, will read books he has
set aside specially and others already half completed. There is a strong
historical thread to the group, Part-read is Joe Lee's Ireland 1912-1985, an
historical work with a personal resonance because of Bain's Belfast mother.
This will be joined by Correlli Barnett's Engage the Enemy More Closely, not
a reference to Insead, the rival French-based business school, Bain jokes,
but a history of the Royal Navy, in which he served. The historical theme is
completed by Under an Open Sky, by William Cronon, a collection of essays on
the American west.
If Sir Simon Hornby, chairman and chief executive of W H Smith, were taking
a holiday, a Trollope novel would be in his suitcase. A rapid and voracious
reader, Sir Simon, a member of the Trollope Society, is working his way
through the author's entire output. Not that such dedication confers
unreserved pleasure. The Macdermots of Ballycloran, Trollope's first novel
and the most recent on Sir Simon's list was 'a boring book, almost
unreadable', he says. Sir Simon reads mainly novels. 'I don't want to be
bothered with other things.' An exception is Jean Genet, Edmund White's life
of the French novelist and dramatist.
