Transportation Committee.

<P>
California is choking on its own traffic. And as a card-carrying member of the 
fraternity of federal, state and local elected officials, I must admit: It's 
our fault. 
</P>
<P>
While vehicles have multipled on the state's roads and freeways, politicians in 
Washington and Sacramento and local governments everywhere have pontificated 
and whined and argued and studied everything concerning transportation. 
</P>
<P>
We've come up with just about everything but specific, comprehensive solutions. 
That might require us to make some hard and unpopular decisions. 
</P>
<P>
There have been numerous stopgap, Band-Aid proposals -- a minor tax increase 
here, a bond issue there -- designed more to mollify an increasingly restive 
motoring public than to address the underlying problems. 
</P>
<P>
But the voters must share some of the blame for our sorry transportation 
situation, too. 
</P>
<P>
Poll after poll shows the public listing transportation as the No. 1 or No. 2 
problem facing California. Poll after poll also shows people willing to fork 
over no more thanan extra penny or two at the gas pump in the expectation that 
it will solve all their driving problems. 
</P>
<P>
It won't. Billion-dollar bond issues and 2-cent tax increases are like so many 
spitballs thrown at a battleship. It's going to take a lot more money, 
innovative and integrated planning and a large portion of personal and 
political sacrifice to do anything about the transportation mess. 
</P>
<P>
It's also going to mean that Californians and their political leaders are going 
to have to shake off years of dust and cobwebs. The last state gas tax increase 
-- 2 cents -- was six years ago, and its benefits were soon wiped out by both 
more fuel-efficient vehicles and by inflation. Before then the gas tax had not 
been increased since 1963. Given our past track record, doing nothing is the 
early odds-on favorite this time around, too. The overriding approach for 
politicians is reminiscent of a little boy reasoning with the splinter in his 
finger: It will hurt to take it out, so let's leave it alone and maybe it will 
cure itself. 
</P>
<P>
Some of us are ashamed of that attitude. We're proposing what we think is a 
sound, sensible and sweeping plan to address California's transportation 
problems. Its major elements include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Requiring local elected officials to reduce urban congestion in their areas 
by 25% over the next five years. If they did, they would get more state money 
for road construction and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Linking future development with needed transportation improvements so that 
growth in one area would not cause congestion in another. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Offsetting the increasing burden on air quality caused by more traffic by 
paying for urban reforestation projects and buying and preserving greenbelts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Giving more money to mass-transit systems while requiring them to be more 
efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Providing enough money to meet all of the state's highway construction 
plans for the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Streamlining the bureaucratic procedures that currently bog down road 
planning and construction. 
</P>
<P>
To pay for it, we would raise the gasoline tax by a nickel a gallon and raise 
commercial truck-weight fees by 30%, then tie increases over the next decade to 
the rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
And here's the really innovative part: Elected officials would have to take the 
responsibility to approve and carry out the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Voters would be asked to do their part by changing the state Constitution to 
modify the current government spending limit. That would keep the overall 
spending limit in place but allow us to spend the extra road dollars. Voters, 
however, would not be asked directly to approve a tax increase. That's our job. 
It's time to stop running like frightened wild beasts to the voters every time 
we face an issue of substance. 
</P>
<P>
Government by initiative is generally a sorry spectacle. The questions posed by 
initiatives are almost always poorly drafted and confusing, and sometimes 
deliberately misleading and dishonest. 
</P>
<P>
It's a wrongheaded and politically cowardly way to run this state. Elected 
officials have to come to grips with the problems that they are paid salaries 
to solve. 
</P>
<P>
"A leader has to lead," Harry Truman said, "or otherwise he has no business in 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
We have to deal with California's transportation problems now, in the most 
comprehensive and effective way we can. 
</P>
<P>
If we can't do that, as elected officials, we should seek other employment.
