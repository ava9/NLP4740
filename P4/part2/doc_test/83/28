With his rosy cheeks and rosette-laden lapel, Felix de Weldon -- sculptor of 
the Iwo Jima Memorial and 2,000 other public sculptures -- is, at 83, something 
of a national monument himself. 
</P>
<P>
Diminutive in stature, eyes a bright clear blue, only his disheveled 
reddish-brown toupee and white lies about age hint at vanity. Red, white and 
blue, he stands foursquare behind the flag and recently was seen on national 
television standing foursquare behind President Bush after presenting him with 
a 66th birthday present: a small bronze replica of the Iwo Jima Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
When De Weldon walked through his own latest photo opportunity, "Legends and 
Myths: Sculpture by Felix de Weldon," the first commercial gallery show for 
this master of memorial tonnage, he seemed pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks wonderful," he said, hugging a female employee of Georgetown's new 
Merrill Chase Galleries -- a large enterprise that has five outlets in Chicago. 
A representative from the home office had come to town especially to train 
employees in the art of selling the newly minted De Weldon sculptures, the 
first he has ever produced on a domestic scale for the mass market. 
</P>
<P>
Three of these works -- a classical figure of Aphrodite, a standing mother 
holding two children, and "Humanity," a negative-relief head of Christ with 
eyes that follow as you pass by -- are the real reason for the show. But they 
are, as is appropriate, set in the context of several models and photographs 
and framed citations related to De Weldon's memorials and portrait busts of 
heroes, presidents and kings. Among them, none of them for sale: 
</P>
<P>
"The Flag Raising on Iwo Jima" (more properly, the Marine Corps War Memorial) 
in Arlington; the monument to Adm. Richard E. Byrd in Antarctica; the National 
Monument for Malaysia, in Kuala Lumpur; the portrait of Eisenhower at the 
Kennedy Center's Eisenhower Theater; Harry Truman at the Truman Library; and 
John F. Kennedy at the Kennedy Library. He served on the Fine Arts Commission 
here under all three presidents. 
</P>
<P>
De Weldon has 30 works in Washington alone, ranging in size from the equestrian 
statue of Simon Bolivar near the Pan American Union to a marble copy of 
Michelangelo's "Pieta" at St. Matthew's Cathedral. The gallery has printed a 
small map for those who would like to make the Washington tour. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the Iwo Jima Memorial that catapulted De Weldon to fame, during World 
War II. An immigrant from Austria, where he was born the prodigious son of a 
wealthy textile manufacturer (killed by Soviet bombs at the end of World War 
II), De Weldon had begun bagging a large share of public commissions in Vienna 
at age 17, beating out his own art professor. After studies in Paris, Rome and 
Madrid, he headed for Oxford and London in the '30s, where he soon was engaged 
doing portraits of society's upper echelons, including British Prime Minister 
David Lloyd George and two kings named George, V and VI. 
</P>
<P>
From there he went to Canada, then to the United States, where he enlisted in 
the Navy as an aviation combat artist. He was stationed at the Patuxent Naval 
Air Station in Maryland, he recalls, when the big break came. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the middle of painting the Battle of the Coral Sea when a wire 
service photo came into the admiral's office showing American Marines raising 
the flag over Mt. Suribachi on Iwo Jima," he says. "They came in every day, but 
this one, by Joe Rosenthal of AP, was extraordinary. It showed the unison of 
action, the forward drive, the will to sacrifice, to hold the flag high." (One 
assumes he has said these words before.) 
</P>
<P>
"That was Friday, Feb. 23, 1945," he recalled, "the same day the flag-raising 
took place. I immediately set to work on a model, working all day and all night 
for three days, and produced a wax model three feet high." His commanding 
officer, recognizing its potential importance as a symbolic rallying cry during 
that dark, bloody time (6,321 Marines lost their lives there in 35 days), sent 
De Weldon and the wax to Navy headquarters in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
That first model had been improvised: "There were no real sculpture materials, 
but there was lots of floor wax, which was too soft, and sealing wax, which was 
too hard, so I melted and combined them," De Weldon says. "The secretary of the 
treasury then asked if I could make a nine-foot-tall version for the opening of 
a war bond drive six months later. And I did." 
</P>
<P>
That plaster-and-stone version stood for three years across from the temporary 
Navy buildings, then on Constitution Avenue. Eventually, it was moved to 
Quantico -- apparently by a Lt. John Warner, now the U.S. senator. At Quantico, 
De Weldon carved another, more permanent version from Indiana limestone. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, De Weldon had been mustered out of the service and -- by a 
joint resolution of Congress -- commissioned to produce the 78-foot-high 
sculpture that now stands in Arlington. In a rented 18th-Century studio on 
Capitol Hill, where the pediment of the U.S. Capitol had been carved by Paul W. 
Bartlett, De Weldon set to work on the project with a crew of riggers, welders, 
carpenters and plasterers. It took six years. 
</P>
<P>
Though he had received only his Navy pay until then, he was promised $600,000 
to complete the work, including all costs of building the model in plaster and 
casting it in bronze. (The total, including pedestal, was $850,000 according to 
reports at the time, $1.2 million according to De Weldon.) The money was 
quickly raised by subscription through the Marine Corps War Memorial Fund. 
"Each Marine had to give $1, and there were 600,000 Marines, so it was done in 
two years." 
</P>
<P>
"It cost more than I got," says De Weldon, who claims he financed the statue 
from 1946 to 1952, when he received the first payment. "As the years went on, 
we had quite a struggle to finance it. It was cast in New York, and the cost 
was enormous." 
</P>
<P>
The 100-ton bronze, cast in Brooklyn, was finally dedicated on Nov. 10, 1954, 
and De Weldon -- along with millions of others who still remember those dark 
days -- has been reaping its rewards ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Asked politely whether the Iwo Jima Memorial was not, in fact, a monument to a 
photograph, he replies, "Not at all. The photograph has one side. My sculpture 
has four sides. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't work from the photograph," he says. "It just gave me the inspiration, 
but I didn't copy it. You only see four men in the photograph -- there were 
actually six. Only the first man is the same as in my monument -- the one who 
pushes the flagpole into the ground. That pole was a Japanese lead water pipe, 
and extremely heavy, and that's what made it so effective -- they really had to 
push hard." 
</P>
<P>
De Weldon also used combat film to help work out his design, which he 
intensified, he says, into a pyramidal composition. 
</P>
<P>
The flag, by the way, became a real flag only after the bronze one on the 
mid-size model got blown out of shape in the wind, "just like spaghetti," 
according to De Weldon. As for the controversial question of whether the 
photograph was posed -- some said the action was staged a second time because 
photographers weren't present when it actually happened -- De Weldon says 
absolutely not. "They raised a small flag that morning," he says, but the 
troops on the beach couldn't see it. "One of the Marines got a larger flag from 
a destroyer, and when they put that up, the picture was taken." 
</P>
<P>
"It's my design -- I can have it reproduced," says De Weldon of the small new 
version he made as a gift to President Bush. "I own the copyright combined with 
the Franklin Mint. If they make more, they have to give me a royalty."

Rosenthal received the Pulitzer Prize.
