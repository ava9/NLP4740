FT  31 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Piggy-back race to replace the Topic
screens

Topic, the London Stock Exchange's 10-year old electronic bulletin board,
was turned off last night, allowing fiercely competitive commercial
providers to enter the business.
The Exchange decided nearly two years ago that it no longer wished to sell
screens which would carry the prices of shares and company news
announcements.
Instead, it announced it would allow two firms to compete to replace its
Topic screens.
In the end, the battle has pitted one of the world's largest information
providers, Reuters, against both of the Exchange's chosen - and much smaller
 -successors.
Of these two, ICV, a London-based company owned mostly by its management,
has emerged as the apparent victor.
ICV has secured contracts for 6,000 positions of the 8,500 estimated Topic
users, giving it 70 per cent of the Topic screen replacement market.
It has placed screens at 80 per cent of UK equity market-making firms and 60
per cent of gilt-edged market-making firms.
By contrast, Telekurs, a consortium owned by a group of Swiss banks, has
about 1,500 screens.
Market users say that it was the relative simplicity and resemblance to the
familiar Topic that led them to choose ICV over Telekurs. Telekurs, they
said, developed a product which tried to incorporate too many features and
which appeared cumbersome.
'One of the things we found out was that a single product would never gain
universal acceptance,' said Mr David Joyce of ICV.
Instead, ICV has developed two products. One is a Topic lookalike and the
other, known as Topic 3, is a more sophisticated offering with the capacity
to produce graphics. This competes more directly with a new Reuters product.
Officially, the race to succeed the Stock Exchange's Topic screens was not
to be a race at all.
The Exchange chose two potential providers, each of which was to serve a
different end of the market.
While ICV was to develop a product catering for smaller, retail-oriented
firms such as private client stock-brokers, Telekurs was to cater to the
market professionals.
But it did not turn out that way. For one thing, Reuters, anxious to expand
its share of the equity market information dissemination business, quickly
came up with its own product, Equity Focus, capable of competing with both
ICV and Telekurs.
In addition, all three companies also realised that what was at stake was
far larger than simply replacing Stock Exchange screens.
That is because the company which leaves the most terminals in brokerages,
investment houses and banks across Britain has the best chance of being able
to 'piggy-back' other equity information services on top and become the
provider of choice for an expanding industry.
Mr Carl Kemp, of Telekurs, has stressed that 'Telekurs is in it for the long
term'.
