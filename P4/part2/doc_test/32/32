Sunday marks the one-year anniversary of the Chinese government's bloody 
crackdown on the democracy movement in Tian An Men Square and, with Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev wrapping up his meetings with President Bush in 
Washington, the weekend will be filled with news, analysis and spin control.

Both "Sunday Today," 5 a.m. (4)(39), 7 a.m. (36), and "Sunday Morning," 8:30 
a.m. (2), will feature reports on conditions in China and the status of the 
student democracy movement one year after the massacre.

Both programs will also provide extensive coverage of developments at the 
summit.

Presidents Gorbachev and Bush are scheduled to appear together to answer 
questions from the Washington and foreign press corps Sunday at 7 a.m. The 
press conference will be carried live by CBS, NBC, ABC and CNN. Most of the

perspectives on the summit.
