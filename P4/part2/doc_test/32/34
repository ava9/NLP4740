FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Postman Pat gets his reward - A
media company producing animated TV shows

Postman Pat, the animated puppet, has been entertaining pre-school children
for years with his gentle humour in the small community of Greendale, but
now at last has won some official recognition for his efforts.
The character has, along with Peter Rabbit, Captain Zed and even
Shakespeare: the Animated Tales, helped to win a Queen's award for exports
for HiT Entertainment, the UK television distribution and co-production
finance company.
The company which started business in October 1989 with only 40 episodes of
Alvin and the Chipmunks and Postman Pat to offer broadcasters, now has one
of the largest animation libraries outside the US with more than 700 half
hours and a total of 900 hours of programming overall.
In addition to animation HiT, which had pre-tax profits of just under Pounds
1m in its last financial year, has developed a second area of expertise -
distributing nature films from around the world under its Wild Media brand
name.
The company is also the exclusive distributor of the programmes of
Television New Zealand which has a catalogue of more than 400 hours of
family drama and natural history programmes.
'More than 90 per cent of our business involves exports,' says Mr Peter
Orton, managing director of HiT, who at the moment is at the international
programme market at Cannes trying to get more television series off the
ground and into international markets.
HiT Entertainment has won its export award in the first year in which it was
eligible - three years complete accounts are needed to be considered.
Recently HiT and Flextech, the oil services company that turned itself into
a media group, confirmed plans to set up a new Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.5m)
fund to back animated programmes. The aim is to create a range of new
animated titles - among the most international of all programme genres - in
the UK, continental Europe and the US. HiT has already come a long way in
just over four years since it was set up by the former sales team of Henson
International Television, a subsidiary of Henson Associates, the company
famous for programmes such as The Muppet Show.
The subsidiary was allowed to move off on its own by Mr Jim Henson, who
before his death had been negotiating to sell Henson Associates to Walt
Disney.
Mr Orton put Pounds 300,000 of his own money in the project and Flextech
took a 20 per cent stake which has now grown to 24 per cent.
The HiT managing director believes the company has been able to grow partly
at least because it is a niche player and has not tried to compete with the
big studios head on.
Distribution these days increasingly involves far more than acquiring rights
to programmes and selling them to broadcasters all over the world.
A good distributor, Mr Orton emphasises, should be in at the start of a
programme concept and be able to create a sales package and raise production
finance before shooting even begins.
For instance, HiT recognised the potential in the Where's Wally books which
have sold more than 16m copies worldwide.
It financed the development costs of preparing an animated series called
Where's Waldo, based on the books, to offer to network television in the US.
On the basis of a detailed treatment and a pilot episode CBS paid Dollars
295,000 an episode for a 13-part series - the first time a US network had
taken a UK-originated series.
The series, however, cost Dollars 345,000 an episode to make. HiT funded the
deficit which it recouped from international sales including a pre-sale,
selling rights in advance of production to TBS, the Japanese commercial
network.
Overall the series generated Dollars 222,000 an episode in television and
video cassette sales outside the US.
An even more complex international story lay behind the making of
Shakespeare: the Animated Tales - six half-hour animated Shakespeare plays
each of which cost Dollars 800,000 to make.
The Welsh Fourth Channel, S4C, the BBC and the Russian animated studio
Soyuzmultfilm were all involved.
HiT was responsible for raising co-production funding and received financial
commitments from HBO, the American pay television network, and Fujisankei,
the Japanese commercial network operator as well as making pre-sales in both
Germany and France.
Meanwhile, Alvin and the Chipmunks and Postman Pat go marching on, because
as Peter Orton says, one of the main advantages of distributing children's
animation programmes - apart from the ease of dubbing into any language - is
that a new audience appears without fail every three or four years.
