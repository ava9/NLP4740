What I Would Have Told Those Wellesley Graduates If They Had Invited Me to 
Their Commencement Instead of Barbara Bush: 
</P>
<P>
It is tempting to tell the graduates gathered here today that you are now 
embarking on the best years of your lives. 
</P>
<P>
It is tempting, but it would be a lie. 
</P>
<P>
The best years of your lives are over. I hope you enjoyed them. It is downhill 
from here. These last 22 years have been a free ride for most of you: You've 
gotten free food, free rent and free clothing. Now it is time to pay up. And 
pay up you will. 
</P>
<P>
Your first big problem is that you were born one generation too late. 
</P>
<P>
You probably expect to have a life better than your parents had. But you won't. 
In fact, you will have to pay for all your parents' mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
I won't bore you with the details, but just for starters you are going to have 
to pay off the savings and loan crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The total is anybody's guess, but current estimates say it is going to cost 
more than World War II. I am not kidding. 
</P>
<P>
Your parents' generation could pay for it themselves, but, frankly, they'd 
rather not. Instead of raising their own taxes, they'd rather borrow the money 
and have your generation pay off the debt. 
</P>
<P>
When I graduated from college in 1970, my generation had the feeling that a 
seismic shift in American life was going on and, young as we were, we were 
ready to take power. 
</P>
<P>
I hope none of you feels that way today, because it's not going to happen. Your 
parents are baby boomers, now in their 40s. This means they will rule America 
at least for the next 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
They will not only hold the top political jobs and head the major corporations, 
but they will also make up a huge voting bloc in their retirement. 
</P>
<P>
And they are going to stick it to you. One obvious example is Social Security: 
You will have to work very long and very hard to pay the Social Security 
benefits that your parents will receive. 
</P>
<P>
Consider it a bill for the last 22 years of pizzas. 
</P>
<P>
And don't expect your parents to be eager to turn the country over to you when 
your turn comes. This is another change in American life. For the first time, 
parents feel they are better educated than their children. 
</P>
<P>
Ridiculous? Last year, a Gallup survey found that 25% of all college students 
did not know in what year Columbus discovered America; 23% confused the 
Communist Manifesto with the U.S. Constitution; 58% did not know Plato wrote 
"The Republic" and less than half knew what the Magna Carta was. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is not difficult to discern: About 38% of all colleges allow 
students to graduate without taking a single history course and 45% require no 
American or English literature. 
</P>
<P>
A few days after the survey results were announced, I received a letter from a 
student at the Baltimore campus of the University of Maryland. "First of all," 
she wrote, "as we are not required to take basic courses of history and 
literature, why should we study something that we really don't enjoy or feel we 
will never use in the future?" 
</P>
<P>
Why indeed? Why do anything not required and possibly not enjoyable? 
</P>
<P>
Why, even for a moment in a four-year experience, should you do something even 
slightly daring? Why take a risk and do something that might be "useful" in 
ways you never dreamed? 
</P>
<P>
Why be more than mediocre when mediocrity is all that life demands of you? 
</P>
<P>
Mediocrity will get you through. It always has. It got you through high school 
and through college and, let me assure you, it will get you through the job 
market. 
</P>
<P>
In a few days, I will speak to a journalism class at George Washington 
University (unless they dump me for Barbara Bush). 
</P>
<P>
I will tell the students what I always tell them: They need not be more than 
mediocre to get a job on a newspaper in America today. 
</P>
<P>
Then I will also tell them that if they choose to be more than mediocre, 
however, the rewards can be enormous. They can learn great things and do great 
things and be as a shining star in the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
They will laugh when I say this. They always do. But I will tell them they can 
live today in the same spirit as the American pioneers lived: They can push 
forward into the wilderness and into the unknown. They need not play it safe. 
They need not be mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
All commencement speeches have to quote somebody. So I will quote Theodore 
Roosevelt. He was once a President of the United States. Reading about him may 
no longer be required: 
</P>
<P>
"Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though 
checkered by failure, than to take rank with those poor spirits who neither 
enjoy much nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows 
not victory or defeat." 
</P>
<P>
You graduates can go forth from this day to live in the gray twilight. Many of 
you will. And for those who do, I have but one piece of advice: Learn to speak 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
But some of you will strive to solve our nation's problems in bold and creative 
ways, to do better than your parents did, to show the world the promise that is 
still America. 
</P>
<P>
I can give you no guarantee of success. 
</P>
<P>
You will have only the vast satisfaction of having dared a mighty thing. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you. 
</P>
<P>
Now, can anyone validate my parking?
