RACISM: A MAN HAILING A CAB AT LA GUARDIA MIGHT BE A STAR, A HERO, EVEN THE 
NEXT MAYOR -- BUT IF HE'S BLACK, HE'LL WALK.

"Sir!" the black man running the cab stand was saying. 
</P>
<P>
"Sir!" he repeated, finally catching my eye. "Would you mind standing up here 
for a minute?" 
</P>
<P>
Instantly, I knew exactly what he was talking about. I knew the problem. I also 
knew the trick the big, open-faced fellow had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
The scene: New York's La Guardia Airport. The time: a few minutes before 10 
p.m. New Year's Eve. Like the other passengers just off the Trump Shuttle from 
Washington, I had been waiting in the cab line without success. Cab after cab 
would make the turn from the expressway, drive slowly past our cab stand, then 
swerve away. 
</P>
<P>
I could see exactly what was happening. The cab drivers, one after another, 
were taking one look at the faces of those just-arrived passengers at the Trump 
Shuttle cab line, then speeding up and heading over to the better pickings at 
the Delta terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Most of the passengers waiting in the Trump Shuttle line were black. 
</P>
<P>
I knew this. So did the frustrated guy running the cab stand. I could see it in 
his look when our eyes connected after the 20th or 30th cab had chosen Delta 
over Trump for his choice of fare. He knew what was happening all right. This 
is what went on night after night. Why should it be any different because a 
white man was standing four or five places back in line? 
</P>
<P>
I had almost had enough of this little vignette in American race relations 
circa 1990. After waiting a good 20 minutes, I prepared myself to just bolt the 
hapless Trump line and make the couple-hundred-yard walk to the Delta terminal. 
What was I supposed to do? I was already late. Was I supposed to stand here all 
night just to prove I'm willing to play and suffer by the same rules that 
punish black people? 
</P>
<P>
But something stopped me. Maybe I'd have been marooned there all night, but I 
also couldn't bring myself to just zip over to the Delta terminal. I kept 
flashing on the looks and feelings that would be exchanged by those left 
behind, those watching a white man striding off to his accustomed better 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you mind standing up here?" 
</P>
<P>
Grabbing my bags, I headed to the front of the line. "I thought that's what was 
going on," I said to the man running the stand. 
</P>
<P>
Then it happened. The very next cab swerved to the left, rejecting the Delta 
terminal and making the wide turn toward those of us who had been waiting 
without hope. 
</P>
<P>
I stepped back and let the group of young black men ahead of me board. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks," said the man at the stand. 
</P>
<P>
A few days before this, a man named Colin Powell, who happens to be chairman of 
the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, was cheered as the liberator of Panama. A few 
hours later, an easy-going politician named David Dinkins took the oath as 
mayor of New York. The following evening, a wonderful quarterback named Tony 
Rice led the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame to its big Orange Bowl victory over 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Had they been waiting for a cab at La Guardia Airport New Year's Eve, they 
might still be standing there.
