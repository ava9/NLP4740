The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee accused the Bush 
Administration today of "old thinking" to justify building two new long-range 
nuclear missile systems that may no longer be required. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.) said the pro-democracy movements in Eastern Europe and 
Moscow are changing U.S. defense requirements, but the Administration is 
proposing a 1991 defense budget that does not reflect a reduced Soviet military 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
"There are new realities in the world, but no new thinking at home to match 
them," Aspin told Defense Secretary Dick Cheney at the outset of a hearing on 
the Administration's proposed $292-billion defense budget for the fiscal year 
starting Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, 
defended the budget proposal and argued that no major cuts in spending or 
changes in defense strategy should be considered until new U.S.-Soviet arms 
control agreements are concluded.
