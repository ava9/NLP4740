<TEXT>
<P>
Less than a year after struggling mightily to avoid it, the armed forces have 
now abruptly reversed course and begun scrambling to win a principal role in 
the nation's war on drugs -- seeing it as a lucrative haven at a time when 
their traditional mission is shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
Ambitious proposals that only recently would have been scorned as inappropriate 
have been pouring into the Pentagon and some already have been endorsed 
enthusiastically by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
The armed forces' 10 top field commanders have proposed a host of new anti-drug 
missions that range from launching satellites to spying on cocaine traffickers 
to interdicting heroin shipments at sea as they are smuggled out of Southeast 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"With peace breaking out all over," one two-star general said in an interview, 
"it might give us something to do." 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic reversal reflects a calculated judgment by Pentagon leaders that 
getting a big piece of the drug war could help the military preserve its power 
as its postwar role as a counterforce to the Soviet bloc appears to be in 
decline, Administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the plans endorsed last month are a list of long-term, "Category Three" 
ventures that would require more money for manpower and new technology. 
</P>
<P>
If the plans are approved by the National Security Council and President Bush, 
the Pentagon officials believe the new tasks could provide the military with a 
renewed justification to demand funds for troops, ships and training missions 
now severely threatened by budget-cutters. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden turnabout has also prompted animosity and concern from the federal 
agencies now in the forefront of the anti-drug effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a 180-degree shift," one top official said. "From too little to too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
"They're the biggest kid on the playing field, and they want to punt, pass and 
kick," another official said. "We may decide in the end that we would all be 
better off if they just tried to be good blockers." 
</P>
<P>
The details of the new Pentagon proposals remain classified, and the critics 
said they could not discuss the elements that made them the most wary. But as 
an example of their concerns, two high-ranking anti-drug officials cited a new 
military task force formed last month to help in reconnaissance and drug 
interdiction along the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
The creation of that team, known as Joint Task Force-6, piqued international 
tensions when the Mexican government accused the United States of militarizing 
the Southwest border. And it has since stirred tensions among other anti-drug 
agencies over what they regard as the military's cavalier approach to a 
sensitive task. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to want to do the job all by themselves," said one official who has 
taken part in meetings designed to resolve the dispute. He said the Ft. Bliss, 
Tex.-based task force, commanded by Lt. Gen. George R. Stotser, had not sought 
to coordinate its operations with the El Paso Intelligence Center or other 
federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, the Administration's top anti-drug official, William J. 
Bennett, said he believed it was "terrific" that Cheney and the armed forces 
commanders had been so "eager to get involved." But he acknowledged that their 
aggressiveness had bruised some feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"You've sort of got the Defense Department going all around the place, saying: 
'What about this? What about there? What about here?' " said Bennett, the 
director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the agency heads said to me, 'These guys are great, but you know it's 
like having an 800-pound gorilla fall in love with you. You know, 'Roarrrr -- I 
like you a lot.' " 
</P>
<P>
"You've got this little operation somewhere and the (military) comes in and 
says: 'Hey, how'd ya like 5,000 men?' So we're sorting it out," Bennett said. 
"You've got to be careful." 
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary change in Pentagon anti-drug posture in the last nine months 
has almost entirely eclipsed the hands-off approach that Defense Secretaries 
Caspar W. Weinberger and Frank C. Carlucci doggedly maintained even in response 
to the pleas of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"Our military is not trained to read people their Miranda rights," Carlucci 
retorted in congressional testimony last year. "They're trained to shoot to 
kill." Soldiers are not trained as law enforcement officers and already had an 
essential job defending the nation's security, he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials attributed much of the turnabout to the influence last 
spring of Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, who was preparing to take over as 
the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They recognized the growing 
priority of the anti-drug effort to the new President and public, and 
accordingly began to draft new plans. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Cheney made the new thinking clear by declaring drugs a "direct 
threat to the sovereignty and security of our country." 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, lessening the 
military threat the Pentagon was geared up to meet, added even more impetus. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to the sudden prospect of dramatic cuts in the Pentagon budget, one 
source said, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were expected to treat anti-drug 
proposals from senior commanders critically. Amid the "shock" of a changing 
world, he said, the proposals "must have seemed a godsend." 
</P>
<P>
"Getting help from the military on drugs used to be like pulling teeth," said 
Lawrence J. Korb, a former assistant secretary of defense in the Ronald Reagan 
Administration. "Now everybody's looking around to say: 'Hey, how can we 
justify these forces?' And the answer they're coming up with is drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Air Force analysts have suggested the service might expand the use of its radar 
capability to monitor drug trafficking. In an outgrowth of that thinking, the 
service has proposed that the Airborne Warning and Control System, or AWACS, 
aircraft be dispatched on a series of flights to take place near Colombia in 
coming months, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The longer-term Air Force proposals would enlist high-resolution spy satellites 
to provide glimpses of shifting ground bases for drug traffickers, including 
drug processing laboratories hidden deep in jungles. They might also give a 
boost to systems such as the Joint Service Targeting and Reconnaissance System, 
a high-priced radar designed to plot Warsaw Pact troop movements that some 
believe could offer an unparalleled view of drug traffickers, one analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
Navy budget planners have come up with an ingenious plan to resolve their own 
dilemma: how to operate its growing number of ships with a diminishing pot of 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Their solution, proposed in October and expected to win final approval from the 
White House within a week, was to shift some Atlantic training operations to 
the Caribbean, where they could serve double duty by keeping watch on drug 
trafficking from international waters off Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy move, which could station as many as 90 aircraft and 12 ships in the 
region, would ensure a continued source of training funds -- and with them, 
steaming hours -- for the Atlantic Command, even as the budget dips in the 
coming years. 
</P>
<P>
One retired Navy officer likened the Navy's new-found enthusiasm for the drug 
mission to the service's no-holds-barred bid to get its own nuclear weapons in 
the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going to get our share of the nuclear mission no matter what the 
cost," said retired Rear Adm. Eugene Carroll, deputy director of the 
Washington-based Center for Defense Information. "Now drug interdiction is at 
least a raft to keep you afloat." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Congress first urged the Pentagon to assume a major role in the war on drugs in 
1987, but the armed services resisted the call on grounds that it would detract 
from their war-preparedness roles. A turnabout began in September, when new 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney identified drug-fighting as a top-priority 
military mission. The change has accelerated with the events in Eastern Europe.
