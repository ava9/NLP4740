  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- The United States and Russia 
are apparently planning to hold unprecedented joint military 
exercises, a senior Japanese Foreign Ministry source said 
Wednesday [2 February]. 
  The source said the subject was broached by the former enemy 
powers in a two-day meeting in Tokyo of military brass, 
government officials and academicians from the U.S., Russia and 
Japan. The closed-door discussions on Tuesday and Wednesday, 
the first of their kind to be participated in by all three 
countries, took place in the Trilateral Forum on North Pacific 
Security organized by the Japan Institute of International 
Affairs. 
  According to the source, the participants discussed the 
promotion of a "strategic partnership" between the U.S. and 
Russia. He said it appeared from the discussions that talks on 
joint military exercises were already under way. There were 
suggestions that Japan also participate, but the idea was 
dismissed by Japanese participants as premature, he said. 
  The U.S. participants included Assistant Defense Secretary 
Graham Allison and Adm. Frank Bowman, deputy director for 
political and military affairs on the Joint Chiefs of Staff at 
the Pentagon. 
  Attending from Russia were Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy 
Mamedov, Gen. Andrey Nikolayev, head of the Russian Federal 
Border Service and commander-in-chief of the border forces, and 
Col. Gen. Vladimir Zhurbenko, deputy chief of Joint Staff of the 
Armed Forces. 
  Japanese participants included Yoshiji Nogami, deputy 
director general of the Foreign Ministry's Foreign Policy 
Bureau, and Maj. Gen. Toshimasa Fujiwara, a member of the 
Self-Defense Forces' Joint Staff Office in charge of plans and 
policies. 
  The source said the Russian side expressed a desire to see 
Russia's entry into the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
forum in the future, despite an existing moratorium on adding 
new members. The meeting also covered such subjects as Russia's 
new military doctrine, North Korea's suspected nuclear 
development program, and the future situation surrounding China, 
he said. Japanese participants endeavored to keep discussions 
of China to a minimum since no Chinese participants were present 
at the meeting, the source said. While China and other 
countries may be invited to future meetings, there was not yet 
any consensus on expanding participation, he said. 
  Two more such meetings are planned, the next to be held in 
Moscow, possibly in September, after which a set of policy 
recommendations may be issued to the governments of the three 
countries.
