For the first time since 1944, German armoured cars yesterday rolled down
the Champs Elysees, as part of the new Eurocorps' participation in France's
Bastille Day military parade - and won applause from those in the crowd who
were able to spot their distinctive military crosses.
After the parade, President Francois Mitterrand, who stirred domestic
controversy by inviting German as well as Belgian and Spanish troops, said
he felt 'emotion and joy' at having thus been able to help heal the wounds
of the last war, in which he was taken prisoner, and to point France towards
its future common European defence.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he was 'happy to have been able to attend'
yesterday's march-past, adding that it was 'completely normal' that his
soldiers' participation should cause some criticism in France because 'the
traces of history do not disappear immediately'. Mr Charles Pasqua, interior
minister, complained earlier this week that the 50th anniversary of France's
liberation was the wrong moment to invite the Germans.
But in the last year of his presidency, Mr Mitterrand seems to have pulled
off a piece of political symbolism that has won approval, judging by recent
opinion polls, from most French people. The invitation to the Eurocorps, in
which Germans play a big role, is likely to set a precedent from which any
successor may find it hard to depart.
It was at the suggestion of Mr Edouard Balladur, the conservative prime
minister who is a candidate for the Elysee next year, that three Germans
identified with the July 1944 plot against Hitler attended yesterday's
ceremonies. They included Mr Manfred Rommel, mayor of Stuttgart and son of
Field-Marshal Erwin Rommel, the 'Desert Fox' who also commanded German
troops in Normandy and who shot himself after the failure of the July plot.
For Mr Kohl, the presence of German troops in Paris yesterday constitutes a
further step towards 'normalising' his country's military relationship with
its allies, following the legal ruling this week by the German
constitutional court that German troops could join their allies in
conducting peace-keeping operations outside the Nato area.
The 800-strong Eurocorps contingent, a fraction of the 6,000 troops in
yesterday's parade, included troops from Belgium and Spain, which along with
France, Germany and Luxembourg make up the five-nation force.
