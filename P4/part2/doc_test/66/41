Have Parisians even now really come to terms with Berlioz? In the listing
columns of a leading newspaper the other day, readers were urged to see the
Opera Bastille's new production of Benvenuto Cellini 'to persuade themselves
that this opera is decidedly not Berlioz's masterpiece'. How negative can
you get? And who said Cellini was his masterpiece? Even if it is not on a
level with The Trojans or that wonderful not-quite-opera The Damnation of
Faust, Cellini is a riproaring heartwarming piece of High Romanticism and
self-justification, demanding a place in the national repertory.
It was with The Trojans, in a production that by all accounts failed to set
the Seine on fire, that the Bastille opened almost four years ago. Cellini
is in the main a big success - done well, Berlioz can be relied upon to draw
large audiences in spite of his detractors. Conductor Myung-Whun Chung and
the willing Opera orchestra hurled themselves whole-heartedly at the music.
Though the quieter moments - the lovely duet for Teresa and Ascanio for
example - made their effect, some of the playing was a shade too brash and
brassy, obscuring detail. Plenty of vitality, not enough light and shade.
The producer, Denis Krief, whose Sapho (Gounod) I enjoyed at Saint-Etienne
last season, designed his own sets, costumes and lighting. The result had
unusual homogeneity, a swirling, sweeping, restless evocation of Renaissance
Rome with magical evocations of the Piazza Colonna and the Colosseum -
painted architectural sets in the grand theatrical style of Berlioz's time.
Good to see the big Bastille stage uninhibitedly used, even if the width
meant stringing out the carnival crowds in long lines like a frieze.
Everything was generously planned - yards of material for the riotously
colourful, painterly costumes (as good in motion as they were when still).
What a blessed, wicked pleasure to have an opera evening far away from
clamped-on ideas and strenuous visual ugliness] Could it be, bearing the
Opera-Comique's Mireille in mind, that reaction is on the way?
The 'King Midas' pantomime on Cassandro's trestle stage at the carnival was
elaborately staged, with the stabbing of Pompeo a focal point. I cannot say
I followed the twists and turns of the casting of the statue, but there was
a genuine, growing excitement. At the moment of triumph, a giant impression
of Perseus the height of the proscenium arch was flashed on to a gauze - no
feeble imitation of a bronze figure.
So much for the eye to enjoy occasionally endangered the story line but not
for long. Krief never allowed comedy to topple into farce. The Pope (Romuald
Tesarowicz) and his treasurer Balducci (Jean-Phillipe Courtis) were not
caricatured but shown as potentially tricky opponents, symbols of Cellini's
uneasy relationship with authority (for which read Berlioz and the official
Paris of the 1830s).
Cellini, the goldsmith of genius who was also a brawler, was sung with
swagger and thoughtfulness by Chris Merritt, whose voice has a useful streak
of hard metal as well as Rossini-tenor agility. That voice was taxed by the
role, but the worrying unsteadiness of the opening scenes lessened.
Merritt's appearance combined burliness with distinction of bearing.
The Teresa of Deborah Riedel, full-toned and positive in manner, was the
best I have seen - for once the girl seemed a worthy partner for the artist.
The Ascanio of Diana Montague and Fieramosca of Michel Trempont were
excellent. Much of the evening's musical excitement came from the Opera's
fine chorus, especially the tenors and basses who sang so lustily as
Cellini's fellow-craftsmen.
