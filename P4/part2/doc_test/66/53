a troubled musical year in Europe

It was the year when politics counted more than music. To survive the
financial squeeze, to push through reform, or just to maintain the status
quo, Europe's musical movers and shakers needed friends in high places more
than ever before.
In France, a sympathetic centre-right government was the sine qua non for
Hugues Gall to adopt strong-arm tactics against Myung-Whun Chung, as he
began flushing out the old Bastille regime and laying foundations for the
new. Gall will need a superhuman dose of political guile in coming months if
he is to cut through the Paris Opera's back-stabbing, unionised culture and
give it a clean start next season.
Alone among provincial opera companies, Lyons could shrug off the recession
 -thanks to a culture-loving mayor. No other company north of the Alps saw
its subsidy keep pace with inflation. And none could match Lyons's knack of
picking up foreign tours and prestige recording work.
At Aix-en-Provence, the very absence of political clout left one of Europe's
long-established festivals struggling to survive. Mounting debts and
declining artistic appeal - together with the French government's evident
lack of sympathy - have knocked Aix out of the premier league of summer
festivals.
The situation was little different in Germany, where cultural shrinkage has
become a fact of life. In Berlin, the Staatsoper's political connections,
rather than artistic quality or good housekeeping, gave it the edge over the
Deutsche Oper in their cut-throat battle for public funds. The Deutsche
Oper's intendant, Gotz Friedrich, balanced his books and produced solid
artistic results. At the Staatsoper, Daniel Barenboim's ambitious programme
led to a huge overspend. But thanks to Barenboim's political influence, his
company emerged at year-end with an increased subsidy for 1995 - leaving the
Deutsche Oper with less.
At Salzburg, Gerard Mortier scraped together enough support within the
Austrian establishment to carry his festival reforms forward into 1995 -
despite an antagonistic Viennese press. Buoyed by healthy box-office returns
at the 1994 festival, the board of directors approved Mortier's
commercially-risky plans for a bigger slice of 20th century music next
summer. Their decision set the seal on Mortier's campaign for a livelier,
more contemporary festival. He now seems certain to stay beyond 1997, when
his current contract expires.
Elsewhere in German-speaking Europe, musical life suffered where political
will faltered. The city fathers in Bonn cancelled the triennial Beethoven
Festival, robbing the composer's birthplace of its only musical event of
international scale. In Frankfurt, the fractious governing coalition
advocated self-help, leaving the arts in a permanent state of crisis.
Basle persisted with its drastic scaling-down of cultural subsidy,
undermining morale and vitality. And the Swiss government ended the year by
slashing its contribution to the national cultural foundation, Pro Helvetia.
'Never has democracy been so hostile to the arts,' said a senior German
orchestra manager last month.
Amid the gloom, there were nuggets of comfort. Let us start with Sylvain
Cambreling, who resisted the temptation to leave Frankfurt in disgust, and
instead conducted much-praised performances of Pelleas The Ring and Don
Giovanni. Matthias Bamert took some calculated risks at the Lucerne
Festival, and widened its appeal. Thanks to Alfred Wopmann's canny
stewardship these past ten years, the Bregenz Festival stood out as an
example of how to mix art and commerce. Claudio Abbado brought his
programme-making skills to the Berlin Philharmonic and to Salzburg at
Easter. And the Prague State Opera sought inspiration in adversity, pulling
off revivals of forgotten works by Hans Krasa and Gottfried von Einem.
The biggest loser in 1994 was the Vienna Philharmonic, which found itself
marginalised at Salzburg and criticised on foreign tours - partly because of
its uninspiring choice of star conductors. The other prominent loser was
Myung-Whun Chung: it will be interesting to see what value his record
company places on him without his prestigious Bastille perch.
And now for some awards, based on a personal end-of-year glance across
musical Europe. Conductor of the year is Nikolaus Harnoncourt, whose blazing
Beethoven cycle with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe set the 1994 Salzburg
Festival on fire. Orchestra of the year is the Oslo Philharmonic, for
refusing to bow to the cynicism and complacency widespread in the
profession. Composer of the year: 91-year old Berthold Goldschmidt, who
lived to enjoy his rehabilitation in Germany at this year's Berlin Festival.
The most memorable instrumental performance was Miklos Perenyi's account of
the Haydn D major cello concerto at Salzburg in August - a matchless display
of old-world musicianship, entirely at the service of the composer.
The most satisfying opera production I saw was Billy Budd at Geneva,
conducted by Roderick Brydon and staged by Francesca Zambello: what a pity
the same cast and conductor cannot accompany the production to Covent Garden
in May. The outstanding individual performance was Robert Tear's Vere. The
most promising young singers were Andrea Rost (Gilda in the Muti Rigoletto
at La Scala), Rene Pape (Fasolt at Bayreuth) and Gwynne Geyer, the American
soprano who has been singing Marenka and Mim in Geneva over the past six
weeks. Flop of the year was the new Bayreuth Ring.
