RANGIROA, French Polynesia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gauguin could have painted the colorful picture that came into focus through 
the faceplate of my snorkeling mask in these aquamarine waters of the South 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
A coral sculpture shaped like the head of a tiki god had a golden glow. Small 
fish created a rainbow of colors around it. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I were snorkeling in the lagoon shaped by the atoll of Rangiroa in 
the Tuoamotu archipelago about 200 miles northeast of Tahiti, where Gauguin 
arrived from Paris near the end of the 19th Century to begin his greatest 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
The lagoon is a sea within a sea. It could contain the entire island of Tahiti 
within its stretch of 42 miles by 16 miles, surrounded by the rim of Rangiroa 
atoll that rises with its lush tropical foliage and two Polynesian villages 
above the submerged crater of an ancient volcano. 
</P>
<P>
Two passes through the rim, with tidal currents between the open sea and the 
lagoon, help to make these waters one of the great destinations on this planet 
for the adventurous traveler who enjoys snorkeling and diving. 
</P>
<P>
All of the Tuamotus were once barrier reefs that surrounded volcanic islands. 
As eons passed, the inner islands subsided, leaving only the rims and coral 
reefs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Underwater Life 
</P>
<P>
Here on Rangiroa, in the heart of the world's largest collection of coral 
atolls, you can view a fabulous variety of underwater life by inflating your 
life vest and riding the currents to and from the open sea. 
</P>
<P>
This adventure has to be carefully coordinated with a pickup by the inflatable 
boat or outrigger canoe that provides your base for snorkeling or diving near 
the reefs. 
</P>
<P>
If you are renting your own outrigger or small boat, check in advance for the 
timing of the current so that you don't end up too far out to sea or into the 
lagoon when the tide changes. This flushing of the tidal currents keeps the 
aquamarine waters of the lagoon crystal clear. 
</P>
<P>
We arrived in the Rangiroa lagoon aboard the Wind Song sail cruiser with 120 
adventure-minded fellow passengers, including 19 certified scuba divers and at 
least twice that many snorkelers. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Dag Dvergastein, our Norwegian skipper, and the pilot brought the Wind 
Song between the reefs of the tidal pass into the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
From the anchorage, slipping or jumping over the rim of the inflatable took us 
instantly into a coral underworld with more fish than we could possibly 
identify or name. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diving Excursions 
</P>
<P>
If you arrive in the lagoon with your own sailboat, or aboard the 
passenger-carrying freighter or one of the smaller cargo carriers serving the 
islands of French Polynesia, you can arrange for snorkeling and diving 
excursions from the villages of Taputa and Avatora. 
</P>
<P>
Scuba diving centers are based at Kia Ora Village Hotel across the pass from 
Taputa, and at the Raie Manta Club in Avatora. 
</P>
<P>
There are also daily flights between Tahiti-Faaa Airport and Rangiroa. The 
46-passenger Air Tahiti planes make the flight in about an hour. One-way fare 
is about $100 U.S. 
</P>
<P>
All of Rangiroa has scarcely 1,400 inhabitants, most of them in or around the 
two villages. 
</P>
<P>
For longer stays than a Wind Song or cargo vessel stopover, there are three 
hotels and nine pensions and private homes with accommodations for guests. 
</P>
<P>
Kia Ora Village, the largest of the hotel complexes, has only 25 thatched-roof 
bungalows in a coconut grove beside the beach. Amenities include a restaurant 
and bar with tables on the beach-front deck, where guests or visitors from the 
beach and the reefs can relax after snorkeling and diving. 
</P>
<P>
When we had finished our underwater adventure along the reef, we tendered from 
the anchored Wind Song to the Kia Ora and went snorkeling from the beach into 
another coral world alive with multicolored fish. Some of them came close 
enough to look right into our faceplates. 
</P>
<P>
Rates for a twosome at a Kia Ora Village beach bungalow are about $270 U.S. a 
night, including breakfast and dinner. Among free activities for guests are 
snorkeling, sailing, bicycling, windsurfing and fishing. One of the optional 
activities is scuba diving with a qualified instructor. 
</P>
<P>
A plaque at the Kia Ora reads: "Welcome to Kia Ora Village -- first hotel of 
the atolls, founded in 1972 by three lovers of the Tuamotu Islands -- Serge 
Arnoux, Robin Angely and Laris Kindynis. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Carnoux and Angely had wandered to the Tuamotus from France; Kindynis from 
Greece. 
</P>
<P>
Pension and private home accommodations start at about $30. For information in 
helping to plan a Rangiroa underwater adventure, check with your travel agent 
and contact the Tahiti Tourist Board, 12233 W. Olympic Blvd., Suite 110, Los 
Angeles 90064, (213) 649-2884.

New underwater adventure tours: 
</P>
<P>
Tropical Adventures of Seattle, worldwide dive tour specialists since 1973, now 
represent the Aggressor Fleet of six 110-foot aluminum live-aboard boats for 
divers and underwater photographers. 
</P>
<P>
Each boat houses a maximum of 18, with comfortable cabins, meal service and a 
photo center for daily film processing. 
</P>
<P>
Four regular tours in Caribbean waters include dive destinations off Bonaire 
and Curacao, Belize and the Cayman Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Belize dive sites offer such famed underwater destinations as Half Moon Wall, 
Long Cay Drop-Off, Southwest Cut, Terminator Wall, the Elbow, Silver Caves and 
the Blue Hole. 
</P>
<P>
The package price of $1,195 includes accommodations aboard and all meals for 
eight days and seven nights. You make your own flight arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Another new Tropical adventure combines a dive photograph expedition to 
Tanzania with a photo safari in Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
"This coast," points out Lynn Goddess, co-owner of Tropical Adventures, "is 340 
miles long, entirely protected by an immense coral barrier reef, and offers one 
of the finest collections of marine life in the world -- whale sharks, huge 
grouper, manta rays, moray eels and an amazing potpouri of colorful reef fish." 
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania &amp; Kenya Coast Dive-Photo Safari offers accommodations, meals 
and all related expenses, including round-trip air fare from New York, at 
$4,195 per person.
