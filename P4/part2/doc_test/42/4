Although the round-the-world flight of 11-year-old Tony Aliengena may appear to 
be the stuff of high adventure, aviation experts see it more as an affirmation 
of the advanced state of modern aviation than the marvel of a boy wonder. 
</P>
<P>
"Any 10-year-old could do this without any training whatsoever," said Philip 
Lesch, 30, a flight instructor at Martin Aviation at Orange County's John Wayne 
Airport. "This is a great experience for Tony, but he's really not flying that 
plane." 
</P>
<P>
Tony, a San Juan Capistrano fourth-grader, is now flying across Soviet Asia in 
his quest to become, according to the Guinness Book of World Records, the 
youngest person to circumnavigate the globe by air. 
</P>
<P>
The trip, dubbed Friendship Flight, began June 5 in Orange County and is to 
cover about 17,000 miles. A highlight came in Moscow last week when Tony 
presented Soviet officials with a friendship scroll signed by thousands of U.S. 
schoolchildren. On Sunday, Tony was passing over the Ural Mountains from 
Kuibyshev to Tumen, 700 miles into Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
The man who conceived of the trip, Tony's father, Gary Aliengena, is a licensed 
pilot. When they are airborne in their Cessna Centurion 210, Aliengena sits at 
Tony's side at all times, giving the boy the benefit of his years of flying 
experience, much as he did last year when Tony became the youngest person to 
fly across the United States. Aliengena also performs the bulk of the other 
duties required for such an inter-continental air trip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Official Observer 
</P>
<P>
Also on board is Gunter Hagen, 58, a retired physicist from Malibu who is 
serving as an official observer for the National Aeronautic Assn., the U.S. 
body that sanctions all claims for world and national aviation records. It is 
up to Hagen to verify that Tony remains at the controls of the craft throughout 
the trip. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a chase plane carrying reporters and a film crew is tailing the 
Cessna. The pilot of the chase plane remains in constant radio contact with 
Gary Aliengena, swapping information on weather conditions and navigation to 
make sure Tony remains on course. 
</P>
<P>
While taking nothing away from the enthusiasm for what the boy is doing, Lesch 
and other pilots stressed that it is Tony's father who is bearing the real 
headaches and logistical details that come with piloting a small plane around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
It is the father, they say, who is charged with charting the route, checking 
weather conditions and talking with air traffic controllers, and who gives the 
boy expert advice on handling the plane in difficult conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see Tony as the pilot," Lesch said, echoing the view of other pilots 
interviewed. "It's his father who talks to the controller, his father who makes 
all the flight plans. I see Tony there with his hands on the controls, that's 
all. It's like having a credit card and not being responsible for the charges." 
</P>
<P>
The key to flying a plane, Lesch said, "is not the ability to manipulate the 
controls but being able to accept responsibility and everything associated with 
the airplane. Who is watching the weather and reading the maps? Who is talking 
to the controllers and doing the weight and balance of the aircraft? Not Tony." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Lesch said, he too is "touched how this thing has affected 
some people, especially Tony's friends. They are living the excitement of this 
flight vicariously. It's really great for the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Aliengena said in a recent interview that he saw nothing wrong with Tony's 
not being involved in every aspect of the flight. Aliengena compared his role 
to that of a commercial airline co-pilot whose jobs is to prepare the flight 
for the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena emphasized that in the Cessna's cockpit, it is Tony who makes all the 
critical decisions, such as whether to descend or ascend in bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
Several times during the trip, Tony has described the flying itself as 
"boring," and upon landing he has usually rushed off to eat something or watch 
cartoons while his father sets about the business of preparing the plane for 
the next day's journey. 
</P>
<P>
According to local pilots, it is this expertise and backup that is making the 
trip possible. The boy is taking but a minor role in guiding the craft through 
the skies, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Parsons, owner of Avantair, a charter service operating out of John Wayne 
Airport, compared Tony's role in the flight to that of "a kid who does real 
well in a piano recital. But that doesn't mean he can go to a symphony and sit 
down and pick up a piece of music and sight-read it. He just can't do it 
without some help." 
</P>
<P>
"It would take one hell of a guy to do that sort of thing by himself," Parsons 
said. "But here he is with people chasing him, with support equipment and a 
person riding in there on the right side. He isn't really piloting that plane." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice trip for the boy and I think it is great for him, but what he is 
doing is not a difficult chore," said Gregory Wilcox, a charter pilot for 
Martin Aviation at John Wayne Airport who, like Tony, began flying with his 
father when he was just 4 years old. "My kid, or anybody's kid, could do that." 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing inherently dangerous about flying an airplane anywhere, 
anytime," he added. "In many ways, it is easier than driving a car. In this 
case, Tony is just holding the wheel while somebody else does all the work. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not Indiana Jones," he added. "It is not dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Tony's journey is not without peril, however. Pilots who have been following 
the flight note that the Cessna 210, although it is a high-performance small 
aircraft, has a limited altitude and distance range, and in colder weather is 
prone to ice buildup on the wings. In Tony's case, this was avoided on the 
North Atlantic crossing, for instance, with pre-flight planning to avoid storms 
and icy conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots also note that while the general public may see a Cessna's crossing 
vast expanses of Siberia as hazardous, given the relative lack of 
sophistication of Soviet aviation, the journey will be made somewhat easier by 
the multitude of sophisticated and redundant navigational systems on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Tony will not be able to obtain his pilot's license until he is 17, 
and on this around-the-world flight, his father is listed as the pilot of 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike those for driving, aviation regulations do not list a minimum age for a 
person to be allowed to begin flying. The only requirement is that a licensed 
pilot be at the controls. Although it is not a common practice, aviation 
sources said many licensed pilots introduce their children to flying at an 
early age, tutoring them on the intricacies of flying and allowing them to hold 
the controls. Tony himself was introduced to flying at the age of 4, sitting on 
his father's lap as they traveled through the air. 
</P>
<P>
To set his record as the youngest person to fly around the globe, Tony must 
perform all takeoffs and landings (although his father will be at his side to 
intervene in an emergency). 
</P>
<P>
Flight instructors generally commend Tony's ability in that regard, but they 
note that most flying students master landings and takeoffs in the first five 
hours of lessons. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the flight has caught the imagination of many people, among them 
corporate pilot Joe McElroy, who flies for a small Orange County computer 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"I flew airport transports across the Atlantic in World War II, and I can tell 
you it can get hairy out there," said McElroy, 52, a Fountain Valley resident. 
But, he added, "Tony doesn't need to know everything you need to know because 
of his father. Tony is just doing the driving." 
</P>
<P>
To Vi Smith, author of "From Jennies to Jets, the Aviation History of Orange 
County," the journey has been something "that I have followed every day. It 
takes me back to the days of Lindbergh, it's just so exciting. Everyone is 
wishing the boy well."
