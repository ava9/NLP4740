The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to revoke the Class
C and Class E airspace areas at Mather AFB, Sacramento, CA, due to the closure of Mather AFB on May 15, 1993. This proposed
rule would also alter the Sacramento, McClellan AFB, CA, Class C airspace area to encompass part of the airspace previously
delegated to Mather AFB. This proposal would alter the Sacramento Executive Airport, CA, Class D airspace area designation
by removing all references to the Sacramento Mather AFB. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North
American Datum 83. Class C, D, and E airspace designations are published in paragraphs 4000, 5000, and 6003, respectively,
of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14
CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class C, D, and E airspace designations listed in this document would be subsequently
removed or published, as appropriate, in the Order.

Regulatory Evaluation Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'', as defined by Executive
Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). The anticipated costs and benefits associated with this proposed
rule are summarized below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would revoke the Mather Air Force Base (AFB) Class C and Class E airspace areas at Sacramento, CA,
due to the closure of Mather AFB on May 15, 1993. In addition, this proposed rule would accomplish two other objectives.
First, it would alter the Sacramento Executive Airport, CA, Class D airspace area designation, by removing all references
to the Sacramento Mather AFB. Second, it would modify the McClellan AFB Class C airspace area, at Sacramento, CA, by
expanding the boundaries to the south. This modification would be necessary to prevent a potential deterioration
of safety that could result from greater mixing of visual flight rules (VFR) operations and instrument flight rules
(IFR) operations once the Class C airspace area at Mather AFB is revoked. The FAA has determined that the revocation
of the Class C airspace area at Mather AFB would reduce the Class C airspace area and expose the arrival flow of air traffic
to the McClellan AFB to more potentially conflicting VFR traffic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Class C airspace area concept (like that for Class B airspace, though to a lesser extent) was developed to reduce
the likelihood of midair collisions in the congested airspace surrounding large airports in which large turbine-powered
aircraft are mixing with smaller aircraft of varying performance characteristics. In addition, VFR and IFR aircraft
are also mixing. As this complexity increases, so does the potential for midair collisions. This type of condition
warrants an expansion of Class C airspace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary benefit of this proposed rule is that it would ensure that the current level of aviation safety remains
intact. The termination of the Mather AFB Class C airspace area would permit transiting VFR aircraft to fly closer
to McClellan AFB without entering the Class C airspace area. In order to minimize potential conflicts with traffic
intending to land or take off from the airport, the FAA has concluded that the Class C airspace area at McClellan AFB
should be expanded to the south. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would have a positive impact on operational efficiency by allocating additional airspace to users
who choose to avoid the Class C airspace area. The revocation of the Class C airspace area at Mather AFB would significantly
contract the Class C airspace area in the vicinity of McClellan AFB. Aircraft operators who previously circumnavigated
the Mather AFB Class C airspace area would be able to fly in this airspace without contacting ATC or having to satisfy
associated avionics requirements. The planned expansion in the McClellan AFB Class C airspace area would involve
some of the airspace that formerly belonged to the Mather Class C airspace area. Therefore, no additional airspace
would be converted into Class C airspace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would not impose additional administrative cost on the FAA for either personnel or equipment.
The additional operations workload the proposed rule is expected to generate can be handled with current personnel
and equipment resources in place at the McClellan AFB, CA, Class C airspace area. Another potential cost to the FAA
associated with the proposed rule would be the revision of aeronautical charts to reflect the change in airspace around
McClellan AFB. The change would be incorporated during the routine updating and printing of the charts, however,
so that all costs associated with printing aeronautical charts are assumed to be a normal cost of doing business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule is not expected to impose any incremental costs on users to the McClellan AFB, CA, Class C airspace
area. This assessment is based on the fact that the proposed rule would only modify the McClellan AFB, CA, Class C airspace
area by expanding it to the south of McClellan AFB. This additional airspace would be taken from the Mather AFB Class
C airspace area. Any users of this airspace (i.e., pilot schools, air taxi operators, general aviation (GA) operators)
would be able to continue their flying practices in the same manner as before. Thus, the proposed rule would not adversely
affect these airspace users. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would not impose any costs on either the FAA, the aviation community, or society. Although the FAA
concludes that this proposed rule would not have an impact on safety other than to ensure the maintenance of current
levels, the rule proposed is expected to promote the efficiency of operations. Thus, the FAA contends that this proposed
rule is cost-beneficial.
