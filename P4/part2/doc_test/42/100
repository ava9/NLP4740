</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are no roads to Marenco. 
</P>
<P>
Remote, tropical, blessed with unspoiled beaches, towering rain forest and only 
a few flying insects that bite, Marenco Biological Station is a privately owned 
nature reserve along Costa Rica's southern Pacific Ocean coast. 
</P>
<P>
My first view of the station was from a five-passenger, single-engine plane. A 
cluster of red metal roofs beckoned from the forest that surrounded them. 
</P>
<P>
During the trip by launch 10 minutes down the coast from a grass airstrip, we 
passed narrow bands of deserted beaches -- palms and forest encroaching onto 
dark sand. By dinghy, we maneuvered among lava rocks to shore. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two hours after leaving the traffic and sounds of Costa Rica's 
capital, San Jose, I was setting off down a trail that winds silently through 
mile after mile of rain forest giants. 
</P>
<P>
For the next two days I tramped along with four other nature lovers behind 
resident Lou Jost. 
</P>
<P>
The hip-high, red-clay stain on Jost's white pants was a tip-off to trail 
conditions after days of rain. Soon those of us who had gingerly stepped from 
the dinghy, protective of dry shoes, were wading across rivers and slipping 
through mud like veterans. 
</P>
<P>
A green kingfisher, a red-capped manikin, woodcreepers and butterflies welcomed 
us. Although I was a neophyte at bird watching, I saw an exotic, slaty-tailed 
trogon. Mysterious sounds from unseen creatures punctuated the stillness. 
</P>
<P>
Later, a bird book in the Marenco station's small library added color and shape 
to some of the sounds Jost had identified for us. We peered at pages showing 
the Amazon parrot and pale-billed woodpecker. 
</P>
<P>
Our small group neither saw nor heard tapirs, crocodiles, anteaters or sloths, 
but we were treading their turf. 
</P>
<P>
Returning at sunset on trails behind the station grounds, loud, hoarse barks 
pulled us back in search of howler monkeys. In the dim light of a darkening 
forest, we finally saw a troop high in the trees. 
</P>
<P>
Private reserves such as Marenco, along with Costa Rica's internationally 
recognized park system, help conserve the biological diversity of the tropics 
in this corner of Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Though Sergio Miranda, director of the biological station, suggests that 
Marenco is not for the luxury traveler, accommodations are far from primitive. 
</P>
<P>
Lodges on a hill 180 feet above the ocean house two people per room, with 
private baths. Each room has its own terrace looking out at a sweep of 
machete-cut lawn, over the forest and down to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Floors of gleaming tropical hardwood prompted me to leave muddy shoes outside. 
A split-tailed "Jesus Christ" lizard, so called because of its ability to walk 
on water, has taken up residence near the lodges. 
</P>
<P>
The isolation in the midst of tropical rain forest that doomed the fruit farm 
was the key to Marenco as a center for nature-adventure travel. 
</P>
<P>
Three years after Miranda came to Marenco, Costa Rica set aside 87,500 acres 
south and east of it as Corcovado National Park. Corcovado now encompasses more 
than 105,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
"Creation of the national park in 1975 began to change the whole future," 
Miranda said. "The biggest problem then, as now, was how to get into the area. 
I used a dugout to travel out of Sierpe when I was building Marenco." As word 
spread among researchers that Miranda was coming and going in the area, they 
started to contact him to get them to Corcovado. 
</P>
<P>
He not only brought them in, but soon was housing the scientists and then 
university student groups. One day a tour agency called to inquire if a group 
of bird watchers could use his boats. "I didn't know anything about 
natural-history travelers," Miranda said, but he researched the 
nature-adventure travel market and in 1985 went into business. 
</P>
<P>
A stay at the station offers a day with a Marenco guide in Corcovado Park. 
After a 6:30 a.m. family-style breakfast in the dining hall -- eggs, black 
beans and rice (gallo pinto), toast, fruit, juice and coffee or tea -- I set 
out with Jost and four other travelers to see the national park. 
</P>
<P>
A gentle rain was all that remained of a roaring nighttime downpour as we 
transferred from dinghy to launch for a 20-minute ride to San Pedrillo, a 
ranger station marking the northern park boundary. After hiking along the 
beach, we climbed into the forest. 
</P>
<P>
We saw red spider monkeys leaping from tree to tree in search of fruit, one 
toting a baby on its back. My bird list mushroomed -- I saw kiskadees, a 
golden-hooded tanager and anis (of the cuckoo family), and caught a glimpse of 
the huge, turkey-like curassow through thick foliage. 
</P>
<P>
We caught scent of white-lipped peccaries, a sort of wild hog. "If they 
appear," advised Jost, "stand still and hope they don't charge." In case of 
attack, he suggested we climb at least three feet up in a nearby tree. 
Peccaries roam in herds of up to about 50. 
</P>
<P>
The secret to knowing where army ants are on the move? The chirr of antbirds 
that prey on insects fleeing a swarm. Miniature roads in forest litter tell of 
leaf-cutting ants that carry bits of bright green leaves for the fungus gardens 
in their nests. 
</P>
<P>
We touched the white latex of the baco, or milk tree. Indigenous peoples drank 
its "milk," ate its sweet fruit and beat its reddish gray bark to use as 
blankets or clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Fallen flowers on the forest floor hint of riches hidden in the canopy above. 
"That's why I decided to go into the canopy," Jost said. He discovered an arrow 
lost on a previous attempt to climb one of the forest giants; using a 
crossbow,, he shot climbing lines that helped him get to an area of the rain 
forest that has been largely inaccessible to researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Red, yellow, brown and green seed pods -- works of art and engineering -- also 
litter the forest floor. One looks like a child's top. It hangs with the point 
up, and a bottom plug pops out to release seeds into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Printed guides to trails on Marenco's 1,500 acres allow visitors to encounter 
the tropical forest alone, an adventure worth taking. 
</P>
<P>
Walking through the thick carpet of leaves, Jost would suddenly squat to 
briefly detain a brightly colored frog no bigger than his thumbnail. He noticed 
a toucan -- against the sky on a dead tree -- that I could barely see with 
binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
As my eyes adjusted, I, too, made discoveries: A small salamander so delicate 
and tiny, like a toothpick with legs, camouflaged brown against a brown leaf; a 
toucan, unseen, but identified by his song; a baco or ajo recognized. 
</P>
<P>
Jost spun tales of interrelationships in the forest. My favorite was his 
description of the "arms race" between the passion flower and the Heliconius 
butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
The passion flower has Velcro-like leaves with little hooked hairs to catch 
marauding butterfly larvae. The plant also produces egg-mimics on its leaves to 
fool butterflies into thinking that eggs already have been laid there. 
</P>
<P>
Butterflies, for their part, have learned to detoxify the poisonous chemicals 
in the plant or to use them to make themselves toxic to their predators. 
</P>
<P>
Though he refers to these forests as "benign" because of the few bothersome 
insects and snakes that mostly keep to themselves, Jost recalls one woman who 
sat on a log without looking and found herself on the tail of a fearsome 
fer-de-lance, the most dangerous snake in Central America. As Jost yanked her 
up, the surprised snake slithered away. 
</P>
<P>
We ate sack lunches beside the roaring waterfall at Llorona. Although it was a 
cool day from the rain and cloud cover, I stepped in to feel the pounding 
torrent. On a dry, hot day, tired hikers, no doubt, rush to the cooling water. 
</P>
<P>
For those not up to the rigors of an all-day trek through the forest, there are 
miles of uninhabited coastline to explore and there's swimming in rivers or 
ocean, snorkeling and horseback riding. 
</P>
<P>
One need only carry binoculars to the hammock on the terrace to get a view of 
parrots, toucans and maybe a scarlet macaw as they fly through the clearing. 
</P>
<P>
Others saw two humpback whales from the terrace while we were away at 
Corcovado. Residents say that whales announce summer, the dry season that 
begins in December. At night sparkling fireflies can be seen from the same 
vantage point. 
</P>
<P>
One night we descended the long hill to the beach to look in tide pools with 
our flashlights. (Flashlights are essential -- the generator for electricity 
sometimes is turned off as early as 8:30 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
Marine life is abundant, especially around Isla del Cano, a national biological 
reserve about an hour away by boat. 
</P>
<P>
Legend says pirates' treasure is hidden on the island, and Indian graves and 
stone spheres suggest an ancient cemetery. Earlier Indian habitation is also 
evident on the mainland -- while we waited at the airstrip, workers digging a 
drainage ditch unearthed pottery shards. 
</P>
<P>
This is a remote area -- communication with the outside world is by radiophone. 
Plans may have to change according to weather and tides. Visitors do well to 
travel with some flexibility in schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Temperature and humidity on departure day, for instance, made it necessary to 
ferry the five of us out in two trips to Palmar Norte, where we rejoined for 
the flight to San Jose. While three of us waited for the plane to return, we 
were treated to pipas, coconuts a worker cut for us, deftly whacking off the 
tops so we could drink the milk. 
</P>
<P>
Charter flights to the Marenco Biological Station leave San Jose on Mondays and 
Fridays on a 47-minute trip. Cost for three nights at the station is $515, 
including round-trip transfers from hotel to airport, plus flight, lodging, 
meals, guided trip to Corcovado and Rio Claro, and taxes. A four-night package 
adds a tour of Cano Island; cost is $631. 
</P>
<P>
Boat trips must be arranged. There are two possibilities: from Uvita, a coastal 
village where a Marenco boat picks up guests for the two-hour ride to the 
station, and from Sierpe, traveling on the Sierpe River through the largest 
mangroves in Costa Rica and then along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Most visitors prefer the dry season, from December through April. However, 
Miranda says those who want to stay away from the "crowds" should consider 
November or May to August. Even in the wet season, rains are intermittent, but 
September and October can be waterlogged. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am, Mexicana and Lacsa, the Costa Rican airline, fly out of Los Angeles to 
San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
The San Jose office for the Marenco Biological Station is on the second floor 
of Edificio Cristal, on Avenida 1 between Calles 1 and 3. Mailing address is 
P.O. Box 4025-1000, San Jose, Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
Travel companies in the United States who book individual travel to Marenco 
include Seattle-based Journeys (toll-free 800-345-4453), and Voyagers in 
Ithaca, N.Y. (607) 257-3091.
