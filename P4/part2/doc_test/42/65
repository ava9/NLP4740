Good to see someone preserving a sense of humour amid the massacre on Lime
Street. David Springbett, who yesterday published a modified version of the
London insurance market's official business plan, wants to 'springclean the
place'.
Hence the scheme's title: 'Lysold', an old-fashioned cleaning fluid, which
just happens to be an anagram of Lloyd's.
While he may be a self-styled 'expert bullshitter', Springbett clearly has
staying power. Witness his entries in the Guinness Book of Records, which
include the fastest round-the-world trip on a commercial airliner.
Twelve years ago he found himself above the Atlantic seated beside a
striking girl called Paddy, who alas didn't see him as her ideal man. Not
content with pointing out that he was fat, she mentioned that her current
beau was Arnold Schwarzenegger who'd famously earnt a Guinness Book entry as
the most perfectly formed man.
Divining that a mention in said esteemed tome was the key to the young
lady's heart, Springbett contemplated his navel in quest of a way. He hit on
the round-the-world trip for which, being a good insurance professional, he
hedged himself with the bookies at 25 to 1.
Then a quick word with the publisher secured him a quarter-page colour photo
in the next edition - one up on Schwarzenegger, who Springbett claims had
achieved only a black and white.
Upon publication, the young lady accepted his hand, and the two are still
blissfully married. Here's hoping she goes on inspiring him to great deeds.
