  [Text] Pyongyang, January 3 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comes out with an editorial article on the highly important 
tasks for the promotion of the country's reunification set by 
the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his New Year address. 
  It calls upon all the Korean people in the North, the South 
and overseas to wage a nationwide struggle, united under the 
banner of great national unity, thus making this year that opens 
a new phase of national reunification. 
  It quotes Comrade Kim Il-song as saying in his New Year 
address: 
  "The principles and the line of our party and the government 
of our Republic on national reunification remain unchanged. In 
future, too, we will make every effort to reunify the country in 
the form of confederation which is based on one nation, one 
state, two systems and two governments, on the three principles 
of independence, peaceful reunification and great national 
unity." 
  The article says: 
  Our party and the DPRK Government did every possible effort 
last year to implement the 10-point programme of the great unity 
of the whole nation. But their effort was fruitless due to the 
anti- national, anti-reunification belligerent moves of the 
South Korean authorities. 
  As the South Korean reality indicates, the "civilian regime" 
is only a disguise. It does not differ from the successive 
military dictatorial regimes which had been indulged in 
treacheries. 
  With the Kim Yong-sam fascist "regime" left intact, it would 
not be possible to achieve national reconciliation and unity, 
peace and peaceful reunification, nor would it be possible for 
the South Korean people to free themselves from the colonial 
yokes. It would result only in confrontation and war between 
the fellow countrymen. 
  To check the clamour raised by the United States and its 
lackeys under the pretext of the "suspicion of the North's 
nuclear arms development" is a crucial matter to be solved 
either for peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula or 
for the international justice. 
  The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must on any 
account 
be solved through DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  Pressure or threat will have no effect on us. Such an 
attempt may invite catastrophe, far from finding a solution to 
the problem. 
  The United States must act with discretion, aware of its 
responsibility and position as the very one that caused the 
nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, and come out to the 
talks with sincere willingness and fair attitude. 
  The three principles of independence, peaceful reunification 
and great national unity which we have consistently maintained 
constitute the nation's common reunification programme most fair 
and aboveboard which fully accords with the Korean people's 
demand for independence and their fundamental interests. The 
form of confederation is the most realistic and reasonable 
reunification formula which reflects the specific conditions of 
the country where different ideologies and systems exist. 
  We will as ever make all efforts to reunify the country 
through confederacy based on one nation, one state, two systems 
and two governments on the afore-said three principles in 
accordance with the policy of national reunification put forward 
by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. 
  All the people concerned for the destiny of the country and 
the nation, whether they be in the North or South or abroad, 
whether they be communists or nationalists, haves or have-nots, 
atheists or theists, must unite with each other as the same 
nation, transcending all the differences, and pave the way of 
national reunification with concerted efforts.
