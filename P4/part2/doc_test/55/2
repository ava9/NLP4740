<F P=106> ["Separatist's Boloney Against Reunification" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam 
of South Korea in an interview with the U.S. NEWSWEEK on May 31 
took exception to the DPRK's proposal for founding the 
Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo [DCRK]. He told the 
NEWSWEEK that the "Yemen-style reunification based on 
confederacy" would "only result in a tragedy as illustrated by 
the situation in Yemen" and that "we should achieve durable 
reunification". 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam's comment on the "Yemen-style 
reunification based on confederation" without any knowledge of 
the domestic situation of Yemen is meant to connect the DPRK's 
DCRK founding proposal with the Yemen situation in a far-fetched 
manner in a bid to sling mud at the proposal, a NODONG SINMUN 
analyst today says, and goes on: 
  His opposition to the North's DCRK founding proposal means, 
in the final analysis, denying a peaceful reunification of the 
country. 
  The DPRK's confederacy formula based on one nation, one 
state, two systems and two governments has enjoyed widespread 
support and sympathy of not only the entire Korean people in the 
North and the South and abroad but of the world's progressive 
people for its validity, reasonableness and feasibility. 
  Much upset by the enormous vitality of the DPRK's 
confederacy 
formula, the Kim Yong-sam group has resorted to all the 
demagogy, calling it a "strategy of reunification through 
communization" and saying it would result in a "tragedy", in an 
effort to keep its influence from spreading far and wide in 
South Korea rapidly and dampen the ever mounting peaceful 
reunification sentiments of the people. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam is a heinous separatist who has 
opposed national reunification, the supreme task of the nation, 
saying "the concept of hasty reunification is a daydream" and 
"reunification without liberal democracy and market economy is 
no better than division". 
  The "three-stage reunification formula" brought forward by 
him by reenacting his preceding dictators' permanent national 
division proposal with only slight paint on it is a replica of 
the "institutional reunification" doctrine that presupposes 
confrontation and war between the fellow countrymen. It will 
only heighten distrust and confrontation and, furthermore, 
result in a conflict and irretrievable national disasters. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam's talk about "durable 
reunification" 
is, in the final analysis, meant to realize the ambition of 
northward invasion and reunification by "strength", maintaining 
the reactionary colonial system of South Korea and extending it 
even to the North.
