  [Text] Answering a question put by a KCNA reporter about 
the controversy between the United States and South Korean 
authorities over the abrogation of the National Security Law, a 
DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman said today: 
  Recently, the United States expressed its official position 
calling for the abolition of the National Security Law in South 
Korea. 
  Several days ago, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State 
Hubbard, speaking at a university of the United States, held 
that South Korea's National Security Law must be scrapped. 
Afterward, Secretary of State Christopher stated that this 
demand was not a personal view but an official position of the 
United States. 
  As the world knows well, South Korea's National Security Law 
is a fascist law that defines the North as an "anti-state 
organization" and prohibits free dialogue and exchange between 
the North and the South and is an offspring of the military 
dictatorship. 
  The successive military dictatorial regimes of South Korea 
have harshly suppressed the South Korean people, fostered 
North-South confrontation, and obstructed national reunification 
by invoking the anti-communist fascist laws such as the National 
Security Law under the patronage of the United States. 
  Those in the so-called civilian regime in South Korea have 
trampled underfoot human rights and obstructed reunification and 
dialogue so recklessly that even high-placed officials of the 
United States have called for the abrogation of the National 
Security Law. 
  The Kim Yong-sam regime is branded as a civilian fascist 
regime because it keeps the National Security Law intact. And 
it is also due to the National Security Law that the 
multi-channel dialogues and exchange between the North and the 
South were foiled without progress in the past and many South 
Korean people were put into prison or killed for their demand 
for national reunification or visit to the North. Such being 
the case, the National Security Law can be termed the second 
concrete wall, from a legal point of view, built within South 
Korea by the South Korean authorities as high as their concrete 
wall running along the Military Demarcation Line. 
  The National Security Law should have been abolished when 
the 
agreement on reconciliation, nonaggression, cooperation, and 
exchange between the North and the South was adopted and 
effectuated. 
  It is a good thing that the U.S. Administration called for 
the abolition of the National Security Law, the biggest obstacle 
to North-South relations, though belatedly. I think that the 
call came from its understanding that the National Security Law 
is one of the factors that impede the progress of the 
negotiation between the North and the South of Korea. 
  If the North-South dialogue is to progress successfully and 
if peace on the Korean peninsula and the country's peaceful 
reunification are to be achieved, such fascist laws as the 
National Security Law must be abolished in South Korea without 
delay.
