  [Text] Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- The policy of opening 
a new phase of national reunification through the unity of the 
whole nation which was clarified by the great leader President 
Kim Il-song in his New Year address for 1994 indicates the most 
reasonable and realistic way to realize the reunification of the 
country by the internal efforts of the nation in conformity with 
the will and interests of the nation, said Yom Tae-chun, 
presidium member of the Central Committee of the Democratic 
Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland (DFRF), in a 
statement January 6. 
  He pointed out that the DPRK made every possible effort to 
achieve a great unity of the whole nation last year, but the 
South Korean authorities, ignoring it, took the road of 
dependence on foreign forces, the road of North-South 
confrontation. 
  He said the Kim Yong-sam group's criminal acts clearly prove 
that it is a pack of despicable traitors who are clean 
indifferent to the destiny of the nation, only seeking to 
maintain their power, and that it is impossible to achieve 
national reconciliation and unity, peace and peaceful 
reunification of the country while Kim Yong-sam's "regime" is 
left intact. 
  He stressed that all the people who love the country and the 
nation should unite as the same nation in hearty response to the 
"10-point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for 
the Reunification of the Country", the great charter of national 
unity, transcending all differences, whether they be in the 
North, or in the South, or abroad and whether they be 
communists, or nationalists, haves, or have-nots, and pave the 
path to national reunification together.
