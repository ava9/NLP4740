  [Text] Pyongyang, January 4 (KCNA) -- "The principled stand 
of the Workers' Party of Korea on national reunification 
indicated by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in the 
historical New Year address is a highly important guideline 
whereby to overcome difficulties lying in the way of national 
reunification for the present and successfully pushing ahead 
with the cause of reunification with the internal force of the 
nation", declares Pak Song-chol, Politburo member of the Central 
Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and vice-president, in 
his statement Monday. 
  "The great leader in his New Year address elaborated on the 
sincere efforts made by our party and the government of the 
Republic to pave the way for national reunification by the 
united strength of the nation last year and reiterated the 
principled stand of our party on the reunification of the 
country," Pak says, and continues: 
  "In the New Year address the great leader stressed that the 
principle and the line of our party and the government of the 
Republic on national reunification remain unchanged, declaring 
that we will make every effort in the future, too, to reunify 
the country by a confederacy formula based on one nation, one 
state, two systems and two governments, on the three principles 
of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity. 
  "This principled stand clarified by the great leader clearly 
manifests the unshakable will of our party and the government of 
our Republic to bring an early realisation of the independent 
and peaceful reunification of the country in compliance with the 
desire and will of the whole nation in disregard of the change 
of the situation. 
  "Our party and the government of our Republic will make 
maximum efforts to accomplish the cause of national 
reunification in the 90s under the banner of the 10-point 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation put forward by 
the great leader." 
  Pak earnestly calls upon the 70 million fellow countrymen in 
the North, South and overseas to courageously turn out in a 
nationwide struggle for reunifying the country by the 
confederacy formula, united as one under the banner of the 
10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation in 
hearty response to the policy of national reunification laid 
down by the great leader in the New Year address. 
  He expresses the expectation that the world progressives 
will 
extend full support to the Korean people in their struggle for 
the reunification of the country.
