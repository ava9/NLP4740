  [Text] Tokyo, January 12 (KNS-KCNA) -- Chairman of the 
Association of Koreans in Japan for Peaceful Reunification Kim 
Chong-su published a statement on January 11 supporting the 
policy of national reunification reclarified by the great leader 
President Kim Il-song in his New Year address. 
  "The policy of achieving the country's reunification through 
confederacy on the three principles of independence, peaceful 
reunification and great national unity, clarified once again by 
the great leader in his New Year address, fully conforms to the 
will and interests of the whole nation and serves as a highly 
important guideline in accomplishing the cause of national 
reunification by the efforts of the nation itself," he said. 
  "The 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole 
nation is a great charter for national reunification reflecting 
the ardent desire of all the fellow countrymen to achieve unity 
and national reunification transcending differences in ideology, 
ideal and system," he said, and stressed: 
  "The Kim Yong-sam `regime' must refrain from obstructing a 
fair solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula 
through DPRK- USA talks and take the road of national 
reconciliation and unity in response to the 10-point programme. 
  "The Association of Koreans in Japan for Peaceful 
Reunification will wage a more vigorous struggle to make 1994 a 
historic year in which a new phase of national reunification 
shall be opened for founding a pan-national unified state of 
confederacy form in the 90s," he said.
