Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in Pyongyang, 17 
January--read by announcer] 
  [Text] A Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the 
Fatherland [CPRF] spokesman has issued a statement in connection 
with the bellicose, absurd remarks made by the South Korean 
puppets as soon as the New Year began in order to aggravate 
tensions while seeking a large-scale war rehearsal. 
  A statement of the CPRF spokesman: 
  With the start of the new year, the South Korean puppets are 
making bellicose, absurd remarks aimed at further expanding 
provocative war rehearsals and thus aggravating tensions this 
year. According to a report, South Korea's so-called hardliners 
toward the North and military warmongers said that even if the 
Team Spirit joint military exercise were to be suspended this 
year, they would expand another kind of South Korea-U.S. joint 
military exercise to fill the gap created. In the SEOUL SINMUN, 
a paper produced and patronized by the government, they said 
that they would conduct a large-scale war rehearsal combining 
the two military exercises, Ulchi and Focus Lens, in August in 
case the Team Spirit exercise should be suspended. 
  Prior to this, the South Korean ruler and military leaders, 
in a so-called New Year news conference and New Year opening 
ceremony, picked on us again and made bellicose, absurd remarks 
without hesitation, referring to complete combat readiness and 
establishment of an emergency combat posture. While all fellow 
countrymen are resolved with high aspirations to make the year 
of 1994 a year of achieving national reconciliation and unity 
and bringing a turning point for peace and peaceful 
reunification, the South Korean authorities are agitating 
confrontation and war in their attempt to conduct a new 
large-scale war rehearsal in place of the Team Spirit joint 
military exercise. This shows that they intend to seek 
confrontation and war rather than national reconciliation and 
unity again this year. 
  The CPRF sternly denounces the South Korean puppet clique's 
war frenzy of seeking a large-scale war rehearsal against us in 
order to aggravate the North-South relations and lead the 
situation on the Korean peninsula to a grave catastrophe, with 
the start of the new year, and brands it an open challenge to 
the entire nation that desires alleviation of tension, peace, 
and peaceful reunification. 
  As has been known, as a measure to resolve the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula, the issue of suspending the Team Spirit 
joint military exercise in South Korea is on the order of the 
day. At a time like this, the South Korean authorities are 
scheming to conduct another kind of large-scale joint military 
exercise to replace the Team Spirit joint military exercise, 
thus attempting to put a brake on the progress of the DPRK-U.S. 
talks and to lay a new grave obstacle to resolving the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  Even if the Team Spirit joint military exercise is suspended 
in South Korea, if another joint military exercise is conducted, 
the suspension of the Team Spirit nuclear war rehearsal will in 
fact become meaningless. If things turn out this way 
[ironsiguro nagandamyon], the nuclear issue cannot be resolved 
on the Korean peninsula, nor can the alleviation of tensions or 
peace be realized, and a more dangerous war situation will 
prevail instead. The South Korean ruling bunch should never 
miscalculate [opan] our demand to suspend the provocative 
large-scale war rehearsal. 
  We are not only prepared for dialogue but are well prepared 
for war as well. No matter how precious peace may be, we will 
never beg for it. We will resolutely counter [taecho] reckless 
acts of provokers. 
  Confrontation, war, and civilian democracy [munmin] are 
incompatible. If the South Korean authorities that claim 
themselves to be advocates of civilian democracy, continue to 
follow the road of confrontation and war in collusion with 
foreign forces, ignoring fellow countrymen who desire 
reconciliation, unity, detente, and peace, they will certainly 
pay a dear price for the nation. 
  [Dated] 17 January 1994, Pyongyang.
