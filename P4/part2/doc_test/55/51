  [Text] Pyongyang, March 9 (KCNA) -- At a time when the 
working contact for the exchange of special envoys between the 
North and the South is under way, the Kim Yong-sam group started 
on March 7 military exercises directed against the North in 
Inchon and Kyonggi Province which will last till the 14th. 
Commenting on this, papers here today say this clearly 
indicates that the Kim Yong-sam group has no willingness to 
resolve the questions of the peace and reunification of the 
country and is going to invariably seek confrontation and war 
this year, too. 
  A NODONG SINMUN analyst says: 
  If the South Korean rulers are willing to solve the pending 
issues between the North and the South through dialogue and 
negotiation by realizing the exchange of special envoys, they 
must not do acts getting on the other's nerve. 
  Recently, the traitor Kim Yong-sam impudently cried that 
they 
"could not be optimistic" about North-South relations and "the 
United States would not hold the third round of the DPRK-U.S. 
talks before the exchange of special envoys." His remarks fully 
revealed his sinister intention to balk the DPRK-U.S. talks, 
obstruct the solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula, persistently seek North-South confrontation and thus 
slay the fellow countrymen in the North with outside forces. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group decided to introduce into South Korea 
U.S. Patriot missiles which had been used in the Persian Gulf 
war and is now welcoming the deployment of two groups of Apache, 
a main attack helicopter belonging to the U.S. Army, in South 
Korea. And it does not bother to conceal its plan to stage a 
large-scale nuclear war exercise with outside forces. 
  With the Kim Yong-sam group, "civilian" warmaniacs 
desperately trying to plunge the nation into a nuclear 
holocaust, left alone, is it impossible to solve the questions 
of peace and reunification through dialogue and negotiation or 
save our fellow countrymen from another war disaster. 
  A MINJU CHOSON analyst says that the Kim Yong-sam group is 
attempting to frighten the North and ensure the "security of 
power" with reckless war gambles, but all in vain.
