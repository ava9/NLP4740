<F P=106> ["34th Anniversary of April 19 Uprising Marked" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- Hyongyang citizens and 
students held a meeting today to commemorate the 34th 
anniversary of the April 19 uprising of the South Korean people. 
  The heroic popular uprising in South Korea on April 19, 
1960, 
was a massive anti-America, anti-fascist resistance against the 
U.S. imperialists' colonial domination and their stooges' 
fascist suppressive rule and for independent and democratic new 
politics, new system and new life. 
  In his report Choe Yong-hae, chairman of the Central 
Committee of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea, 
said the April popular uprising developed the anti-America, 
anti-fascist struggle and national reunification movement of the 
South Korean students and people to a new stage and fully 
demonstrated worldwide their indomitable, patriotic spirit. 
  He said the desire of the uprisers had not yet been realised 
in South Korea because the U.S. imperialists were still pursuing 
the old policy of keeping hold on South Korea as their colony. 
  He said: 
  "The United States has not only failed to implement the 
DPRK-U.S. joint statement but also reversed the simultaneous 
action steps agreed upon at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, 
made the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks abortive under an 
unreasonable pretext and egged some dishonest officials of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency on to take `the nuclear 
issue' of the DPRK to the United Nations Security Council in a 
bid to isolate and stifle the DPRK by abusing the name of the 
United Nations. The United States has brought nuclear war 
equipment including Patriot missiles into South Korea and massed 
nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and many warships in the 
waters around the Korean peninsula. This indicates that the 
United States is seeking a solution to the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula with `strength.' 
  "The Kim Yong-sam group has engaged in flunkeyist and 
treacherous acts, following outside forces, suppressed the 
pro-reunification patriotic forces, acted a shock brigade in the 
`nuclear' clamor against the DPRK, chiming in with the United 
States in its strategy of a nuclear war, to extremely 
deteriorate the North-South relations and bring the danger of 
nuclear war to the Korean peninsula. 
  "All the compatriots in the North, South and overseas must 
rise up as one in the nationwide struggle for national 
reunification through confederacy and open a new phase for the 
country's reunification this year, united closely under the 
banner of `10-point programme of the great unity of the whole 
nation for the reunification of the country,' irrespective of 
idea, political view, religious belief, political grouping, 
classes and strata and property status."
