  [Text] Berlin, June 23 (AFP) -- One of the main leaders of 
the South Korean student opposition is to meet North Korean 
leader Kim Il-song in Pyongyang and put proposals to him for 
detente and reunification, he said here Thursday [23 June]. 
  Choi Jong-nam, 26, who is also one of the main instigators 
of 
dialogue between North and South Korean students, told AFP he 
would meet with Kim within one week. 
  Civilian activists like Choi, who lives in exile here, have 
often served as intermediaries between the two Koreas in the 
past. 
  He said in an interview that the meeting, arranged two 
months 
ago, would go ahead despite recent progress in dialogue between 
the Koreas and prospects of a summit between the ideologically 
opposed states. 
  "We felt it was vital to pursue a civilian initiative," Choi 
said, "If discussions only take place at the level of 
governmentals, they will again be used by both sides to keep 
themselves in power." 
  He said he would propose that a federal structure be created 
so that both systems, (communist in the north and free-market in 
the south), could coexist after eventual reunification. 
  Choi said he believed "the negative experiences of Germany, 
Vietnam and Yemen show that reunification can only work in a 
federation." 
  He also called for an international conference grouping 
China, Japan, Russia, the United States and the Koreas to be 
convened to resolve the nuclear crisis in the peninsula. 
  An agriculture student, Choi was expelled from Seoul 
University for political activism. The South Korean student 
organization Hanchongnyon [South Korean Feceration of General 
Student Councils] sent him to Berlin last July to coordinate 
dialogue with North Korean students within the Pan-Korean 
Student Alliance for Peace and Reunification. 
  Students from both sides of the Korean divide have 
maintained 
contact in Berlin for years. During the communist era, North 
Korea was particularly well represented in former East Berlin 
within the framework of agreements with like-minded nations. 
  Choi said he was to travel to Pyongyang via Moscow and spend 
two weeks in North Korea. 
  Three South Korean students have visited the North in the 
past, despite a ban on such travel by Seoul and the threat of 
stiff prison sentences.
