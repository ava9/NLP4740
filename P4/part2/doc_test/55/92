<F P=106> [Press statement (tamhwa) issued by Yang Hyong-sop, </F>
alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Workers Party of 
Korea Central Committee and chairman of the Supreme People's 
Assembly, on 15 January; place not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Today our nation is faced with the important task of 
advancing the cause of the fatherland's reunification through 
the united strength of the whole nation. 
  In his historical New Year's address, the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song taught that all Korean fellow countrymen of 
the North, South, and overseas must unite as one under the 
banner of the great national unity to carry out the nationwide 
struggle so that a new phase can be opened this year in the 
fatherland's reunification. 
  Currently, our people are infinitely encouraged by the great 
leader's New Year's address and are vigorously carrying out the 
struggle to achieve the country's socialist construction and the 
fatherland's reunification starting with the beginning of the 
year. The South Korean people and fellow countrymen overseas are 
also actively taking part in the struggle to achieve 
reunification in the nineties embraced with the new enthusiasm 
for the fatherland's reunification. 
  Right at this time, in his New Year's news conference on 12 
January, Yi Ki-taek, executive chairman of South Korea's 
Democractic Party [DP], expressed concern over the current 
South-North relations and the will to meet the great leader by 
personally visiting Pyongyang to improve South-North relations, 
which are at a stalemate. 
  I recognize that Executive Chairman Yi Ki-taek's will to 
visit Pyongyang is motivated by his ardent patriotic sentiment, 
which is naturally possessed by people who worry over the fate 
of the country and nation. I express support for and welcome it. 
  Our Republic's Government has for a long time transcended 
differences in ideology, ideas, and systems to promote great 
national unity. With the desire of reunifying the fatherland, 
our Republic's Government put forth bilateral and multilateral 
negotiations of responsible politicians of the North and South 
and, thus, exerted sincere efforts to realize it. 
  I believe that now is the time when responsible politicians 
of the North and South must gather together to dissolve the 
acute confrontational relations within the nation and jointly 
seek ways to open a new phase in the country's peace and 
peaceful reunification. 
  If South Korea's DP Executive Chairman Yi Ki-taek visits 
Pyongyang with this purpose, we will welcome him with all our 
hearts and will open-mindedly discuss with him the nation's 
matter of grave concern. I express the hope that Executive 
Chairman Yi Ki-taek will visit Pyongyang as his first trip this 
year for national reconciliation, unity, and the country's 
reunification in line with the desire of the whole nation.
