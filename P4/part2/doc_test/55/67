DPRK and chairman of the KSDP Central Committee, on 4 January; 
place not given--read by announcer] 
  [Text] Kim Pyong-sik, vice president of the DPRK and 
chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Socialist 
Democratic Party [KSDP], issued a press statement yesterday [4 
January] supporting the fatherland reunification formula 
clarified by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his New 
Year's address. 
  The press statement by Kim Pyong-sik, vice president of the 
DPRK and chairman of the KSDP Central Committee, is as follows: 
  All KSDP members are filled with boundless excitement and 
swelling emotionAll KSDP members are filled with boundless 
excitement and swelling emotion on hearing the New Year, 1994, 
ushered in by the New Year address of the respected and beloved 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song, a peerless patriot and the sun of 
the nation. 
  The respected and beloved leader President Kim Il-song, in 
his New Year's address, proudly summed up last year's 
achievements of our people who gave full play to the indomitable 
spirit of chuche Korea by vigorously accelerating the socialist 
economic construction with revolutionary zeal and achieved 
successive triumphs in political, military confrontation with 
the imperialists and reactionaries. He also clarified the 
invariable principled stance of the government of our Republic 
regarding the fatherland's reunification and set forth 
programmatic tasks for making 1994 a year of historic upturn in 
our country's revolution and construction. 
  In the name of all the KSDP members, I extend warm support 
and welcome the respected and beloved comrade leader's historic 
New Year's address. 
  The respected and beloved leader President Kim Il-song has 
taught: For our people, reunifying the fatherland is the 
supreme task of our nation which must not be delayed. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, in his New Year's 
address, set efforts of the government of our Republic to pave a 
way for the fatherland's reunification on the united strength of 
the nation to counter the South Korean authorities' antinational 
acts which undermine such efforts. He also righteously pointed 
out that a so-called civilian regime in South Korea is only a 
disguise which does not differ from the successive military 
dictatorial regimes. 
  Out of the people's love of the country and desire to break 
the deadlock lying in the way of the country and the nation, and 
to explore a way for the nation, last year, the government of 
our Republic put forward a 10-point program of great unity for 
the whole nation for the fatherland's reunification and made all 
efforts to put it into effect. 
  The 10-point program set forth by the respected and beloved 
president is a great charter of the national unity and a bright 
patriotic torchlight for reunification aimed at ending the 
tragedy of separation and confrontation forced by outside forces 
and turning out all the compatriots in the North, South, and 
overseas to unite their strength to reunify the fatherland at an 
early date. The only way we can reunify the fatherland in the 
90's is thoroughly carrying out the 10-point program of great 
national unity. 
  Under conditions in which the newly-emerged South Korean 
regime professes itself to be a civilian regime, the government 
of our Republic hoped that they would take the road of 
reconciliation and cooperation in response to our 10-point 
program of great national unity, we also took important steps 
for an exchange of top-level special envoys between the two 
sides. 
  But the South Korean authorities, more wicked than their 
predecessors, have taken the path of depending on foreign forces 
and of confrontation between the North and South and ignoring 
our magnanimous proposal and the desire of the entire nation for 
reunification. 
  Contrary to their open declaration that any allied country 
could not be better than the nation and that they would promote 
the North- South relations proceeding from the point that we are 
the same fellow countrymen, they staged large-scale nuclear war 
exercises almost every day against their fellow countrymen in 
collusion with outside forces and drove the North-South 
relations to the worst situation on the pretext of North's 
nonexistent nuclear issue. 
  They left intact evil fascist laws, including the National 
Security Law which is a relic of the previous military fascist 
dictatorship, and the Agency for National Security Planning and 
the Defense Security command, which are suppressive agencies, 
thus brutally suppressing the righteous struggle of the South 
Korean people and students for independence, democracy, and 
reunification. 
  How can the Kim Yong-sam regime be called a civilian 
government and different from preceding military fascist regime 
when it did nothing but treachery, fascist and splittist acts, 
and North-South confrontation [taegyol] during its rule helped 
by outside force? 
  National independence is to love one's country and relying 
on 
outside force is to ruin one's country. The reason that our 
country is divided into two and that the tragedy of division is 
not ended are also because of the outside force. The outside 
force brought us not benefit but misery in the past. It is 
laying on us not mercy but pain today. 
  It is an intolerable antinational crime that the South 
Korean 
authorities keep refusing the fellow countrymen's offer to open 
a road for the nation to live on through reconciliation and 
cooperation between the North and South, and joining the outside 
force to aggravate North-South confrontation and intensify the 
tension. 
  Our nation should never choose to bring about 
self-destruction and let the outside force gain the profit by 
fighting with fellow countrymen under any circumstance. The 
road our nation should walk along is not the road of war due to 
hostility and confrontation but the road of reunification 
through national reconciliation and cooperation. 
  To a nation, independence is life. To defend the life, the 
whole nation should unite together. A nation not united cannot 
display its might, and a nation without might cannot keep its 
independence. If our nation achieves the great national unity 
with the pride of having kept a single nation for over 5,000 
years since Tangun, we can competently repulse any outside 
force's invasion or interference, break off [kkokko porigo] 
great powers' might, and achieve reunification in the nineties. 
  In his New Year's speech, the great leader pointed out that 
the Republic Government will make all its effort in the future 
to achieve the country's reunification in the form of the 
confederal system based on one nation, one country, two systems, 
and two governments, in accordance with the three major 
principles of independence, peaceful reunification, and great 
national unity. 
  If our nation, which has lived as a single nation during the 
long 5,000-year history, joins wisdom and might with national 
ideology, it could establish a pannational united country in the 
form of the confederal system for the North and South to coexist 
and co-prosper as we wish leaving two systems and two 
governments existing in the North and the South as they are. 
  All Korean compatriots in the North, the South, and overseas 
should come out and firmly unite as one under the banner of the 
10- point program of the great unity of the whole nation for the 
reunificaiton of the country transcending the differences of 
idea and ideology, and political preference and religion, to 
establish a reunified country in the form of the confederal 
system. 
  In this year's New Year's speech, the respected and beloved 
leader President Kim Il-song also set forth the Republic 
Government's principled position that the nuclear issue of the 
Korean peninsula should by all means be resolved through the 
DPRK-U.S. talks. The nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula was 
originally raised not because of the suspicion over the North's 
nuclear development that the United States and its followers are 
talking about but because the United States brought in nuclear 
weapons to South Korea and threatened us with the weapons. 
  Therefore, the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula should 
be resolved through the face-to-face negotiations between the 
United States which brought in nuclear weapons, and we, who are 
directly facing the threat. The United States should know that 
there is nothing to gain by clinging to suppression and threat. 
  As the respected and beloved president has taught, the 
nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula should be resolved in 
conformity with the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement. 
  The principled position on national reunification declared 
by 
the respected and beloved leader President Kim Il-song in his 
New Year's speech is indeed an inspiring banner for overcoming 
the difficulties faced by the nation and vigorously driving the 
whole nation to the great cause of reunification in the nineties. 
  All party members of our Korea Socialist Democratic Party of 
Korea, of which political ideology is the triad of men's 
independence, national independence, and mankind independence, 
shall make all their efforts to achieve the reunification in the 
nineties with great national unity highly upholding the New 
Year's speech of the great leader President Kim Il-song. 
  Taking the opportunity, I firmly trust that all Korean 
compatriots in the North, the South and overseas will come out 
as one to the sacred cause of making this year as the historical 
year that opens a new phase of the national reunification highly 
upholding the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole 
nation for the reunificaiton of the country.
