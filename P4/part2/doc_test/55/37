  [Text] Pyongyang, January 21 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
in an article titled "Whither Are They Leading North-South 
Relations?" Accuses the South Korean puppets of pursuing 
North-South confrontation and war against fellow countrymen in 
conspiracy with outside forces, not national unity and 
reconciliation, from the beginning of the year. 
  The author of the article says: 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique makes provocative remarks 
from 
the beginning of the year over the fiction of "nuclear issue of 
the North" and declares that in case the Team Spirit joint 
military maneuvers were suspended this year, it would hold 
large-scale war exercises combining Ulchi and Focus Lens. 
  Judging from their words and deeds, there is no doubt that 
they will pursue North-South confrontation and resort to 
military adventures against the North this year, too. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam opened the rice market of South 
Korea in order to curry favour with his U.S. master and hurt 
fellow countrymen. Thus, he fully revealed his treacherous 
color as a colonial stooge. 
  The South Korean people have risen up in a struggle to oust 
despicable Kim Yong-sam, saying there is nothing to expect from 
the puppet who kowtows to his imperialist master, sells off the 
country and the nation and tramples down the people's desire for 
independence, democracy and reunification. 
  It is evident that the wretched puppet clique forsaken by 
the 
people will persistently pursue North-South confrontation and 
may resort to military adventures, tailing behind outside 
forces, in an attempt to get rid of the crisis. 
  The South Korean people will never pardon the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique seeking war against the nation's desire for 
peaceful reunification.
