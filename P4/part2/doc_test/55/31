  [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam 
recently at a party in "Chongwadae" [presidential offices] 
contended that the reunification of the country is "fantasy" and 
"unification concept must be discarded." 
  Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today brands this as an 
unpardonable separatist remark against reunification. 
  The news analyst says: 
  To reunify the divided country is the supreme desire and the 
most urgent task of the nation. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam's remarks denying reunification 
itself are an intolerable insult and challenge to the 70 million 
Koreans who crave for national reunification and fight for its 
realisation. 
  He not only utters words against reunification but also 
works 
hard to block the peaceful reunification of the country. 
  It is none other than the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique that 
categorically opposed the ten-point programme of the great unity 
of the whole nation, a common reunification charter of the 
nation, turned down the North-proposed convocation of a national 
conference for national reconciliation, unity and reunification, 
frustrated the exchange of special envoys between North and 
South, totally blocked North-South dialogue and drove the 
North-South relations to confrontation and the brink of war. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam must clearly see the trend of the 
times, refrain from separatist acts against reunification and 
step down as demanded by the people.
