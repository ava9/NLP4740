The thoroughly genteel, correct, proper, well-bred and Emily Post-like response 
to the opportunities presented by the second annual Black Tie Car Wash &amp; 
Cafe, to be given June 17 as a benefit for the San Diego County Mental Health 
Hospital, would be to drive one's vehicle through a commercial car wash before 
taking it to La Jolla to be scrubbed by a band of formally dressed civic 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
It would be vastly more polite, without question, to present an immaculate auto 
to the sponges wielded by such volunteers as former Police Chief Bill Kolender 
and UC San Diego Chancellor Dick Atkinson than to bring in a vehicle covered 
with the baked-on grime of a monthlong journey through Baja California. 
Sponsors of the event remain confident that individuals who once received 
parking tickets or were placed on academic probation will not take advantage of 
the situation by driving up in automobiles that most recently were taken 
off-roading through mud bogs and cow pastures. 
</P>
<P>
Kolender shares chairmanship duties with Nancy Hester, who founded the event 
last year and also is known as the founder of La Jolla's annual Off-the-Wall 
Street Dance, the enduring summer frolic always given on the last Sunday of 
August as a benefit for the UCSD School of Medicine. Campy, tongue-in-cheek 
touches are the norm at both events, and, at the Black Tie Car Wash, they will 
include entertainment by one-man-band Ira Cobb; brunch and lunch prepared under 
the supervision of food mavens George Munger and John Baylin, and a bar 
(non-alcoholic beverages only; the group discourages drinking and driving) 
presided over by society bartender Ed Washington. 
</P>
<P>
A large group of notables has signed on to wash cars in the parking lot behind 
the San Diego Trust &amp; Savings Bank office on Girard Avenue, including 
sports broadcaster Charlie Jones, retired Marine Corps Gen. Louis Metzger, 
banker Bob Adelizzi, John Murphy, Kate Adams and Janet Gallison. The car wash 
and cafe will be held between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., and tickets are priced at 
$15. For further information, contact Nancy Hester.

SAN DIEGO -- Sponsors of Saturday's "Come Sail With Us" benefit for the Assn. 
for Retarded Citizens-San Diego expected sweet results from the gala dinner and 
auction, given in the Marina Ballroom at the San Diego Marriott for 275 guests. 
</P>
<P>
The net proceeds will be divided among the eight countywide ARC programs. One 
that will share in the bounty is Archer's Confectionary, a Carlsbad candy 
kitchen 
</P>
<P>
that employs the mentally retarded and hopes to acquire two new candy machines 
that will allow it to significantly expand its operations and payroll. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be able to increase employment at Archer's when we get these machines," 
said Richard Farmer, executive director of ARC-SD. " 'Come Sail With Us' will 
help us to put more of the mentally retarded and developmentally disabled to 
work. The more employment we are able to offer the handicapped, the less of a 
burden they are on society." 
</P>
<P>
The event took its theme from one of its main live auction offerings, a 17-foot 
power runabout; in a cheerful echo of this major item, the silent auction 
included an inflatable dinghy for those bidders who feel most comfortable when 
they are nearest the shore. Among other items up for bid were a kind of reverse 
ploy on Arizonans entitled "Zonies Beware," in which a pair of San Diego 
tourists will be shipped off to Phoenix for the weekend, and a luncheon aboard 
the historic Cyrus K. Holliday private railroad car. 
</P>
<P>
Chairwoman Char Nordell emphasized that funds raised by ticket sales and the 
auctions will go directly to benefit ARC clients. 
</P>
<P>
"The proceeds will be used for capital equipment that will benefit client 
development, and not for any other purposes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Honorary chairmen Jaci and John Einhorn led a guest list that included Carol 
and Jim Davis, state Sen. Wadie Deddeh (D-Chula Vista), Nancy Garland, Jane and 
Willis Fletcher, Susan and Ed Fuller, Dean Nordell, Ann and Steve Hall, Leslie 
Autry, Judy Fivecoat, Richard Shea and Bonnie Mackey. 
</P>
<P>
A "Frisbee dance," even when performed by free-style Frisbee champions Stacy 
Anderson and Rick Castiglia, might not set quite the desired tone at the 
run-of-the-mill fashion luncheon, but it was a natural for "Sports Stars in 
Style," given May 1 by the Hall of Champions Auxiliary in the Mission Ballroom 
at the Town &amp; Country Hotel for more than 525 guests. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson and Castiglia set the tone for the dozens of participating athletes 
(the roster included six members of the San Diego Sockers and Chargers 
quarterback Mark Vlasic), who often can be reticent in public, but decided to 
camp things up a bit as they swept down the runway in fashions from The 
Highlander and Lillie Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Virginia Monday organized the fund-raiser for the Balboa Park sports 
museum's summer youth program. 
</P>
<P>
"The children are going to be so happy because of what this show will make 
possible for them," she said. The event netted $30,000, and museum President 
Ron Fowler said 5,000 youngsters are expected to participate in the summer 
program of entertainment and water and sports safety film presentations. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the on-stage cavortings of Stars &amp; Stripes navigator Peter Isler, 
football Hall of Fame honoree Ron Mix and champion surfer Jim (Mouse) Robb, the 
day offered silent and live auctions that included a goodly number of 
sports-related offerings. The most hotly contested item -- travel arrangements 
and a pair of tickets to the September semifinals of the U.S. Tennis Open in 
New York -- sold for $2,700. 
</P>
<P>
Harriett Fowler co-chaired a committee that included Kay Rippee, Lynn Silva, 
Linda Saxon, Diane Pastore, Linda Horrell, Barbara Rieger, Sara Jackson, 
Jennifer Heft, Barbara Franovich, Lynn Luckey-Thompson, Barbara Malone, Fran 
Golden, Rosemary Logan, Pat Lijewski and Betty Hubbard.
