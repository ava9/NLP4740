RULING BARS BUYOUT STUDY OF SDG&amp;E BY WATER AGENCY 
</P>

A Superior Court referee Tuesday temporarily blocked the County Water 
Authority's plans to study a municipal takeover of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric 
Co., granting the utility's request for a restraining order until a fuller 
hearing can be held March 14. 
</P>
<P>
Ruling that the month's delay will do no harm to the Water Authority's bid to 
conduct a feasibility study, Superior Court Referee Harold F. Wolters wrote 
that the outcome of the court case hinges on the Water Authority's efforts to 
win passage of state legislation allowing a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego) is sponsoring legislation that would 
change the 45-year-old law that created the Water Authority to give it the 
power to acquire the utility. 
</P>
<P>
"Until legislative action authorizes (the Water Authority) to own and operate 
the SDG&amp;E system, it cannot legally do so," Wolters wrote in his decision. 
" . . . Should that proposed legislation fail, there is good reason to believe 
that (SDG&amp;E) could prevail ultimately in this action, as the facts are 
presented to the referee at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Water Authority officials expressed surprise at the decision, but promised to 
continue with lobbying and other activities related to the legislative effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a setback," said Jim Melton, director of public information for the 
Water Authority. "We are very surprised and very disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money for Study Frozen 
</P>
<P>
Melton agreed that Wolters' decision freezes expenditure of the $100,000 
budgeted for R.W. Beck &amp; Associates, a Seattle-based consultant that is 
under contract to conduct the feasibility study. Melton said that Water 
Authority lawyers would study the decision to determine whether any more of the 
$940,000 budgeted for takeover activities is frozen by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Utility officials, who hailed Wolters' ruling, claimed that the restraining 
order prevents the Water Authority from spending any money except the funds 
devoted to its legislative effort. Steven Wall, SDG&amp;E's attorney, declined 
to specify the amount of money he believes is frozen. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Downey, spokesman for San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who has led a 
high-profile campaign against the merger, also expressed disappointment with 
Wolters' ruling. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E officials "keep contending that once the facts are out, people will 
see that this is the most wonderful thing ever," Downey said. "The question is, 
what are they afraid of? Let's have a study." 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E filed suit in Superior Court last week to prevent the Water Authority 
from spending taxpayers' funds to conduct a study of the takeover. The agency 
wants to explore the takeover as an alternative to SDG&amp;E's planned 
$2.4-billion merger with Rosemead-based SCEcorp, parent company of Southern 
California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Under threat of the SDG&amp;E lawsuit, the Water Authority's board of directors 
voted Thursday to increase the budget for the first phase of its takeover 
effort from $250,000 to $940,000. The budget includes money for the study, 
lobbying, legal defense and public relations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Cause Taxpayers Harm 
</P>
<P>
As a county taxpayer, SDG&amp;E argued in a hearing Tuesday morning that 
allowing the Water Authority to spend public money would cause taxpayers 
irreparable harm. Water Authority attorney Paul Engstrand did not dispute that 
the utility has the standing to make that argument, though he disagreed with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the reasons we jumped in now, because as this thing develops 
through the feasibility analysis, it is totally possible that they could spend 
millions of dollars," said Karen Hutchens, SDG&amp;E's governmental affairs 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Wall also contended that the Water Authority had no right to conduct the study 
before the passage of legislation allowing a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to stave off the temporary restraining order, Engstrand countered that 
SDG&amp;E would suffer no irreparable harm if the study proceeded until a 
fuller hearing on the matter sometime in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Wolters, saying that a balancing of the competing claims led him to decide in 
favor of SDG&amp;E, worried that "the expenditure of funds of a considerable 
sum when from public assets should be of particular concern if, in fact, there 
is some doubt as to whether such funds could be recovered." 
</P>
<P>
Wolters, a retired Superior Court judge, scheduled a March 14 hearing on 
SDG&amp;E's request for a preliminary injunction, which, if approved, would 
extend the ban on the feasibility study until the lawsuit could be litigated.
