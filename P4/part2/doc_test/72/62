San Diego has a reputation of running away from helping AIDS victims, the 
leader of a national organization that helps AIDS sufferers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Merdian, executive director of the National Assn. of People with AIDS, 
made the statement in urging San Diego County organizations to work together 
more closely to help victims of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Merdian said cooperation among organizations will become more important because 
fewer federal dollars will be alloted to care for AIDS victims in the future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use of Volunteers Urged 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been told that San Diego is a place to run away to, to get out of 
politics and AIDS assistance work," Merdian said. "A lot of people are not 
involved here, and I find that very interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Merdian noted that his organization has many people who have either been 
diagnosed as carrying the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or as AIDS 
patients. He challenged local assistance providers to enlist as volunteers 
those directly affected by the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Let us show that we can be productive members of society," said Merdian, who 
himself was diagnosed with AIDS in 1986. "We do have an important voice in the 
fight against AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Merdian's comments came during the start of a two-day California Assn. of AIDS 
Agencies conference under way at the U. S. Grant Hotel. His speech drew 
immediate reactions from many of the conference attendees who work helping San 
Diego-area AIDS victims. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Herstand, executive director of the San Diego AIDS Project, said the work 
of the various local agencies is beginning to coalesce, pointing to the 
creation of an HIV coalition, an educational task force and an AIDS assistance 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully we're putting the infighting behind us," he said. "I've seen a lot 
of collaborative efforts." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Absolutely Right On' 
</P>
<P>
But Bill Freeman, executive director of the AIDS Assistance Fund of San Diego, 
said that Merdian's comments were "absolutely right on," that local agencies do 
need to pool their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about ways to work together, ways to collaborate, ways to 
coalesce," he said. "And we're finding ways to work together." 
</P>
<P>
And Lois Gail, an official with the Center for Social Services, said local AIDS 
assistance groups should worry more about making San Diego "the lead city" in 
helping victims, rather than concentrating on parochial efforts to make their 
independent groups "the lead agency." 
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation is the only way we can maintain the focus on the client," she 
said. "We need to learn to work together." 
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Dr. Michele Ginsberg, San Diego County chief of AIDS and 
community epidemiology, released the results of recent studies showing that the 
virus remains prevalent among homosexual males who also use intravenous drugs, 
and female prostitutes, who often have many sexual partners and drug 
addictions. 
</P>
<P>
But, on an upbeat note, she said that, although two in every 10,000 blood 
donors nationwide have been found to be carry HIV, the rate has been only 1 in 
10,000 in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very positive statement in terms of the donors and in terms of the 
safety of our community," she said.
