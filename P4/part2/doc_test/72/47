<TEXT>
<P>
As a research librarian at the downtown San Diego library, Evelyn Kooperman 
answers a lot of trivia questions about names, dates, quotations and other 
oddball information. 
</P>
<P>
She also reads a lot of books about San Diego County: 350 at last count. 
</P>
<P>
Now she has married her two professional passions into a nifty, 406-page 
paperback titled "San Diego Trivia" ($12.95, Silver Gate Publications). 
</P>
<P>
It's got everything you never knew about local history, geography, 
architecture, sports, music, art, theater, literature, place names, movies, 
television, plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
Like: 
</P>
<P>
* Who turned San Diego from a Democratic city to a Republican one? 
</P>
<P>
 Land baron Alonzo Horton, who arrived in 1867 and announced that he would hire 
only Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 * What county supervisor had to either resign or live in his barn? 
</P>
<P>
 J.P.M. Rainbow in 1893. When the county line was redrawn, his house was in 
Riverside, his barn in San Diego. He resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 * How many of the 138 prostitutes arrested in the Nov. 10, 1912, raid on the 
downtown red-light district promised to reform? 
</P>
<P>
 Two. The others bought train tickets to Los Angeles. Most of the tickets 
proved to be round-trip. 
</P>
<P>
 * What San Diego mayor took office by climbing a ladder and crawling in a 
window? 
</P>
<P>
 John L. Sehon in 1905. His enemies said he was ineligible because he was a 
retired Army captain, so he launched a preemptive strike. 
</P>
<P>
 * Was there ever a nudist colony in Balboa Park? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, during the 1935-36 California Pacific International Exposition. But the 
cops required the women to wear brassieres and G-strings; the men, loincloths. 
</P>
<P>
 * What local city was named for a woman's first husband and then renamed for 
her second husband? 
</P>
<P>
 Santee. Raisin grower George Cowles settled the area in 1877 and called it 
Cowlestown. His widow later married realtor Milton Santee. 
</P>
<P>
 Kooperman, 43, a native San Diegan and graduate of San Diego State University, 
says she got the idea for a trivia book after KFMB radio asked her two years 
ago to submit some questions for a contest. 
</P>
<P>
After that came nights and weekends of combing through books and old 
newspapers. She's already dreaming of a second edition, after finishing 10 new 
books on San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit of trivia, she notes, is not a trivial matter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking for a Perfect Fit 
</P>
<P>
North County identity crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The Palomar Pomerado Hospital District in Escondido has changed to the Palomar 
Pomerado Health System. Presumably patients will be now systematized rather 
than hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
In Encinitas, the city government has a contest to find a mascot or logo to 
symbolize life on the suburban coast. 
</P>
<P>
A suggestion: How about an adjustable-rate mortgage payment superimposed on a 
BMW repair bill? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knowing the Score 
</P>
<P>
Political fallout: 
</P>
<P>
* There was a reason you didn't see any pictures of Gov. George Deukmejian 
standing beside Mayor Maureen O'Connor, Police Chief Bob Burgreen and 
Councilwoman Gloria McColl before, during or after their meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Before reluctantly agreeing to the meeting, the Duke put down an ironclad 
condition: no news photos. 
</P>
<P>
* Before we get giddy on the gassy rhetoric of populism, consider that John 
Hartley won a City Council seat with fewer votes than any candidate in several 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
His 7,900 votes represent 1.3% of the city's registered voters. Explain to me 
again how district elections ensure that the "voice of the people" will be 
heard at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
* The "new politics" has some old political faces. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Shepard, former Hedgecock strategist and criminal co-defendant, was an 
adviser to both Hartley and Linda Bernhardt. 
</P>
<P>
* There's no truth to the rumor that Hartley's first legislative proposal will 
be to decriminalize the selling of lobsters from the back of flatbed trucks. 
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, McColl branded Hartley as an outlaw because of his three 
citations in the early 1980s for peddling edible crustaceans without a license. 
Now, he's keeping them at arm's-length.
