TOUGH CURBS ON WATER USE URGED IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY

<P>
The San Diego County Water Authority voted unanimously Thursday to ask its 24 
member agencies to enact mandatory water-reduction measures. 
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented effort to tighten the taps while facing a drought that has 
parched the state, the authority's board of directors recommended prohibiting 
residents from washing cars, watering lawns or filling swimming pools during 
the daytime, restaurants from serving water to customers except when requested, 
and homeowners from washing down sidewalks, driveways or tennis courts at any 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The authority's action is a recommendation to the 24 individual governments and 
water boards in the county, which now must independently decide whether to 
follow through with the restrictions that officials hope will achieve a 10% 
savings in water use. 
</P>
<P>
Authority officials said they believe most of the member agencies will adopt 
the water-saving measures, which would be mandatory after the failure of a 
voluntary program in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt any will go against (the recommendations)," said Byron M. Buck, 
director of the authority's Water Resources Planning Division. "This shouldn't 
have any lifestyle impact -- we're just asking people to cut wasteful use." 
</P>
<P>
Before the San Diego panel voted, officials of the Metropolitan Water District 
of Southern California, which supplies water to Los Angeles and Southern 
California, urged the authority to adopt the tough measures. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a secure water supply," said Carl Boronkay, MWD general manager. 
"What is needed is a comprehensive statewide policy." 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Water District supplies water from Oxnard to the Mexican 
border. Among the 130 cities in its region, only about 10 have adopted 
ordinances similar to the San Diego proposal, MWD spokesman Jay Malinowski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping all cities will respond in a fashion similar to San Diego," he 
said. "Virtually every city south of Sacramento should be adopting such 
ordinances, if they haven't already." 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions supported by San Diego's water authority resemble an ordinance 
passed last year by the Los Angeles City Council. That ordinance also 
prohibited hosing down hard surfaces such as driveways; serving water in 
restaurants unless requested, and allowing irrigation water to run off into 
gutters, Malinowski said. 
</P>
<P>
But the San Diego proposal goes further than the Los Angeles ordinance in that 
it restricts the watering of residential lawns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 of California's 58 counties have instituted some kind of water 
restrictions, said Dean Thompson, a spokesman with the Department of Water 
Resources' Drought Center in Sacramento.
