An overflow crowd packed the Escondido City Council chambers Thursday as Indian 
leaders from throughout Southern California testified before a U. S. Senate 
committee about a host of problems besetting local tribes and their 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii) chaired the hearing of the Select Committee on 
Indian Affairs and told the estimated audience of 250 that he is "aware of the 
sad and tragic history of Indians in California." 
</P>
<P>
Inouye began the hearing by reminding representatives of the various tribes 
about the hundreds of Indian treaties violated by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
"The history of Indians in the United States is not a bright chapter. . . . 
That is the history of the U. S. government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some speakers blamed their tribes' problems on the muddled bureaucracy of the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs, but others addressed a variety of issues, including 
the shortage of money for reservation health programs and a disparity in 
federal funding for San Diego County tribes. 
</P>
<P>
Several speakers pointed out that larger tribes on the East Coast and in the 
Midwest receive a greater share of the funds. Inouye said he is aware of that 
and explained that the BIA believes the tribes are "too small" and refers to 
them as "tribalettes." 
</P>
<P>
He advised the local bands of Mission Indians to form a confederacy, much like 
the Iroquois, to lobby Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Fletcher, tribal administrator for the Rincon Indians, said it is the 
larger tribes that have the financial resources to hire attorneys and lobbyists 
to press Congress for more funds. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, who lives on the Pachanga Reservation in Riverside County, was one of 
a handful of tribal leaders at the hearing who addressed the problem of urban 
encroachment on reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't think about it. You don't see it. But we see the problem from the 
reservation, and it's getting worse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tribes want to work with the county and local planning commissions on 
development and density issues, Fletcher said. 
</P>
<P>
"Reservations have little or no input on development issues. . . . Our survival 
depends on our being able to work with the county and local governments on 
development issues." 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher cited as an example the new community of Rancho California, north of 
Temecula, where more than 6,000 housing units have been built next to the 
Pachanga Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
"The county sent us notices about the development," Fletcher said, "but nobody 
really asked for our input. . . . The tribes are concerned because developments 
often desecrate our burial grounds and other sacred sites."
