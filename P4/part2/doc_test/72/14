In a move that may help set the tone for the first days of his Administration, 
Gov.-elect Pete Wilson on Tuesday named a 35-member advisory council to assist 
in his transition to power. 
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan list of appointees includes old names and new, women and 
minorities, people in the private sector and longtime government officials. 
Many of the members campaigned for Wilson or raised money for his election. 
</P>
<P>
In forming the council, Wilson apparently hopes to show that he will reach out 
to a broad cross section of Californians and not govern in isolation, as Gov. 
George Deukmejian has sometimes been criticized for doing. The council will 
first meet in early December and probably disband by Jan. 7, when Wilson is 
inaugurated. 
</P>
<P>
Otto Bos, Wilson's director of communications and public affairs, said Wilson 
used similar advisory boards as mayor of San Diego and as U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's very important that we not get caught with preconceived notions 
and assumptions that don't necessarily exist," Bos said. 
</P>
<P>
The council will be chaired by Republican Kirk West, president of the 
California Chambers of Commerce, and Democrat Bill Hauck, a Sacramento 
businessman who was the top aide to the late Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti. 
</P>
<P>
Other political insiders on the list include Ken Khachigian, an attorney who 
has written speeches for Ronald Reagan and Deukmejian; former Rep. Clair 
Burgener and former Assembly Speaker Bob Monagan. 
</P>
<P>
The council also includes several representatives of local government, 
including San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding and Orange County 
Supervisor Gaddi Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
For advice on education issues, Wilson will turn to, among others, Maureen 
DiMarco, who is president of the California School Boards Assn.; Jaime 
Escalante, the Garfield High School math teacher who was portrayed in the movie 
"Stand and Deliver," and University of California Vice President William Baker. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the council members have a background in law enforcement, including 
Lourdes Baird, U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, and Ron Newman, president of the 
San Diego Police Officers' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
For expertise on health and social service policy, Wilson named Dixon Arnett, a 
former assemblyman who is now a health care consultant; Dr. Al Anderson, 
president of the President's Committee on Mental Retardation, and William 
Tainter, executive director of the San Diego Community Center for the Disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the panel include Lou Barnett, a Glendale business consultant; 
Joanne Kozberg, chairwoman of the California Arts Council; Matt Fong, the 
unsuccessful Republican candidate for state controller; Irvine Co. executive 
Jack Flanigan, and the Rev. William Turner, pastor at New Revelations Baptist 
Church in Pasadena.
