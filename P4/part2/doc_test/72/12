COURT VICTORY ON CARE FOR POOR CALLED HOLLOW;

TO COUNTIES WON'T MEAN MORE FUNDS.

<P>
A state court has determined that California regulators illegally transferred 
costly indigent care programs to the counties in 1982, but local health-care 
experts doubt that the ruling will generate more funds for indigent care in San 
Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous decision on Friday, the 1st District Court of Appeal in San 
Francisco ruled that the state illegally forced counties to assume the burden 
of providing medical care that previously was included in the Medi-Cal program. 
State funding for indigent medical care in San Diego County conceivably could 
jump to $62 million from the current $41 million annually because of the 
ruling, said Paul B. Simms, deputy director of physical health services. 
</P>
<P>
But "the truth of the matter is that I don't expect" more money from the state, 
Simms said. "I don't expect the state to fill the (funding) commitment mandated 
by the courts." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Simms predicted that state regulators will challenge the ruling because 
the state Constitution prohibits individuals -- in this case, the Alameda 
County residents who brought the suit -- from suing the state. And, even if the 
Supreme Court upholds the decision, state regulators would face spending 
barriers set in place by the Gann Initiative, Simms said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great decision, but where's the money going to come from?" asked James 
Lott, President of the Hospital Council of San Diego and Imperial Counties. "It 
really doesn't mean a hill of beans at this point" because spending limits 
would prohibit the state from increasing state funding, Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
The likelihood that the ruling will prompt increased state funding for adult 
indigent care programs is "as likely as the planet reversing its rotation," 
said Stephen Shubert, executive director of the San Diego Council of Community 
Clinics, a coalition of local clinics that provide care for uninsured and 
under-insured San Diegans. 
</P>
<P>
The county has reduced the quantity of medical care for indigent adults in 
recent years, largely because of state budget cuts that have occurred since 
1982, when the state shifted responsibility for indigent adult medical care 
from Medi-Cal to county-run programs. 
</P>
<P>
More than a quarter of San Diego's population is uninsured or under-insured, 
but state funding is available for just 26,000 people, leaving an estimated 
600,000 people "at risk," Shubert said. 
</P>
<P>
"With $41 million, you have real problems in holding the system together and 
keeping it working," said Shubert, who described the potential -- but unlikely 
-- $20 million windfall as "a drop in the bucket." 
</P>
<P>
The budget that Gov. George Deukmejian proposed Jan. 10 will force more cuts in 
County Medical Services, the program that provides medical care for many 
indigent adults, Simms said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you what cuts we'll make, but . . . we'll have major system 
reductions" should the budget be introduced, Simms said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's budget would force county administrators to reduce health program 
funding by $4 million, Lott said. "CMS is the deep pocket for this county," 
Lott said. "But (cuts) would come at a time when we've identified an 18% 
increase in demand" for indigent medical care, Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
CMS responded to previous state budget cuts by tightening up requirements and 
eliminating care for about 8% of the eligible population. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County received $41 million for its indigent-care program during the 
fiscal year that began July 1, 1988, Simms said. Deukmejian's initial budget 
for the current fiscal year calls for reducing San Diego's funding level to $35 
million. However, the $41-million level eventually was restored.
