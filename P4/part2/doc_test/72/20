SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without discussion, the San Diego City Council on Monday passed a resolution 
urging the federal government to close the Virginia Street border crossing and 
consolidate all commercial traffic at an expanded Otay Mesa border crossing. 
</P>
<P>
The move is supported by San Ysidro community groups concerned about traffic, 
noise, safety and pollution caused by southbound truck traffic, but is opposed 
by businesses near the Virginia Street crossing, according to a report from the 
city's Intergovernmental Relations Department. 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. Customs Service plans to expand the Otay Mesa crossing, where 
northbound commercial traffic now crosses the international border and where 
the bulk of industrial development is occurring. However, the agency is 
attempting to determine whether the Mexican government will enlarge its side of 
the Otay Mesa crossing before proceeding, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, southbound trucks continue to use the Virginia Street 
crossing, which could remain open at least two years while the two governments 
reach agreement on the Otay Mesa expansion.
