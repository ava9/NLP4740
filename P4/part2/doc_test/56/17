As a Vietnam War historian, I was pleased to read the Aug. 26 review by Charles 
Bowden on "Looking for a Ship" by John McPhee. Bowden's review summarizes the 
changes within the merchant-marine industry during the past 20 years and it 
clearly outlines the potential impacts the current events in the Middle East 
and the Persian Gulf may have on the merchant fleet.

However, readers should not forget that when American merchant ships become the 
illegal targets of foreign governments' military action, it is the American 
military that is called to the rescue. All we have to do is recall the Vietnam 
War and the SS Mayaguez. 
</P>
<P>
On May 12, 1975, while the U.S. was still at war in Southeast Asia, the 
Mayaguez, under Capt. Charles Miller, was fired upon by Cambodian gunboats and 
forcefully boarded while in international waters off the coast of Cambodia. The 
40 civilian crew members were taken hostage. 
</P>
<P>
As outlined in Roy Rowan's book, "The Four Days of Mayaguez," President Ford 
ordered a rescue mission involving Air Force, Marine and Navy personnel. The 
crew members and ship were rescued, but at a loss of 15 American military 
personnel killed and three missing. Fifty more were wounded in the rescue 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
As the United States answers a new call for democracy, let us not forget that 
when serving in a battle zone, the merchant marine is at times exposed to 
danger. Yet it is ultimately the American military personnel, earning far less 
per year than the $30,000 to $60,000 of a merchant seaman, who will be called 
upon to rescue that merchant fleet, even at the risk of being wounded or 
killed.
