near the Black Sea mouth of the busy strait has again raised the issue of
rights of passage

Turkey's concerns over increased tanker traffic through the Bosporus were
brought home with a vengeance over the weekend with a fatal mid-channel
collision, which left at least 15 crew dead, up to 16 missing, and the
threat of a hazardous oil spill in one of the world's most densely populated
international waterways.
'It is tragic that an accident like this has to occur for us to be able to
make our case,' said Mr Timur Erkmen, a maritime expert in the Turkish prime
minister's office.
The accident, late on Sunday night, resulted when the Nassia, a
Greek-Cypriot registered oil tanker, collided with a coaster near the Black
Sea mouth of the strait. Last night the ship was still burning. An official
at the Turkish port authorities warned of large-scale environmental
pollution if the wind changed.
Unhindered passage for all merchant ships traversing the Bosporus and
Dardanelles, which divide Europe and Asia, is guaranteed under the 1936
Montreux Convention.
Only warships require permission of the signatory countries, which was an
important control over the Soviet Union's fleet during the cold war.
Although the passage is considered dangerous with erratic currents and 12
narrow turns, it is not obligatory to take navigational pilots. The Istanbul
maritime authority estimates that fewer than half of the 40,000 vessels
which traverse the Bosporus each year take a pilot on board.
Currently the only means of regulating the traffic is through the sanitary
checks, which all vessels have to undergo.
In the wake of the break-up of the former Soviet Union, trade volumes have
increased sharply as the Bosporus is for many of the newly emerging states
the most direct route to western markets.
Additional traffic is expected following last year's opening of the
Mainz-Danube central European canal system, linking the Baltic with the
Black Sea.
However, Turkey's particular concern is over the threat posed by a large
increase in oil cargoes if the central Asian countries choose to ship new
finds to western markets via the Bosporus.
According to Turkish estimates, an additional 75m tonnes of crude would pass
every year through the strait if the Black Sea route is used, compared with
around 5m tonnes today.
Azerbaijan is currently in final negotiations with a western oil consortium
led by British Petroleum.
Kazakhstan is developing the vast Tenghiz field. The issue is of particular
concern for the Russians, who want both countries to utilise the existing
Russian port at Novorossysk
The Turkish government has raised its concerns with the International
Maritime Organisation, the United Nations body which handles maritime
disputes. From July, Turkey will introduce new rules for vessels longer than
150 metres, in a decision clearly aimed at the oil tankers. The changes
include the introduction of new traffic lanes, and restrictions on large
vessels using the strait at night. Yesterday the governor of Istanbul, Mr
Hayri Kozakcioglu, warned: 'No further growth in tanker traffic should be
allowed.' The Turkish foreign minister, Mr Hikmet Cetin, called for an end
to all explosive materials being shipped through the Bosporus.
Restricting the Bosporus passage will add costly delays. Turkish officials
believe it may also force the oil companies to consider more favourably
Turkey's own proposal to build a pipeline to the Mediterranean.
In a related development, Lloyds of London has been commissioned by an
unnamed group of US oil companies to consider navigational and environmental
safety problems posed by additional traffic through the Bosporus.
However, the issue has thrown up an awkward dilemma for the Turks.
While conscious of the environmental threat to Istanbul's 10m inhabitants,
Turkey is also aware that the dispute could damage its relations, not just
with Russia, but with all the littoral states on the Black Sea, with whom it
is attempting to cement political and economic ties.
