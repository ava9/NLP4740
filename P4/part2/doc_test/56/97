Military strength -- Due to a typographical error in a commentary Friday by 
Barry Posen on Iraqi and U.S. military strength, the number of tanks in the 
U.S. arsenal was understated. The number is 15,000. And a sentence on 
assistance by our European allies should have referred to large numbers of 
European merchant ships rather than large numbers of merchant marines.
