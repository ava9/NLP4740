CENARGO, the UK marine group, said yesterday it would defy the Spanish
authorities and launch a ferry service next week between the Moroccan port
of Nador and Almeria in south-east Spain.
The decision brings to a head a dispute between Spain's merchant marine
authorities and Cenargo that tests the European Community's single market
deregulation of cabotage between Community members and third nations.
The issue has been complicated by Madrid's fears that a Nador-Almeria link
will undermine the economy of Melilla, a Spanish-controlled enclave in
Morocco close to Nador, which has so far monopolised sea communications
between Morocco's eastern Mediterranean region and mainland Spain.
The ferry service between Melilla and Spain that Madrid wants to protect is
run by Transmediterranea, a state-owned shipping line in the process of
being sold to Banco Central Hispano, BCH, one of Spain's leading banks.
Mr Michael Hendry, Cenargo's chairman, said he intended to start a regular
daily ferry service between the Moroccan and the Spanish ports on April 26
'despite the continued opposition of the Spanish authorities'. Mr Hendry
said his Pta1.5bn (Pounds 8.4m) investment had the backing of the British
government and was in accordance with the EC's Single Market directives.
A spokesman for the merchant marine secretariat in Madrid said that should
the Cenargo ferry, Scirocco, owned by the group's UK registered subsidiary
Ferrimaroc, sail to Almeria from Nador next week it would either be
prevented from entering the Spanish port or arrested on arrival.
The Madrid authorities are claiming that they have yet to amend a 1979
agreement signed with the Rabat government that shares out ferry services
between Spain and Morocco between the countries.
