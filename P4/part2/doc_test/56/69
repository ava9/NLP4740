FT  18 FEB 94 / Incentives call for merchant shipping
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was yesterday urged to provide fiscal incentives to halt the
decline in Britain's merchant fleet by Mr Donald Anderson, a Labour defence
spokesman.
In the Commons he was joined by Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Conservative MP for
Upminster and chairman of the cross-party defence committee, in doubting
whether enough merchant ships would be available to support a task force
similar to that mounted for the Falklands war in 1982.
Mr Anderson said fiscal incentives would help to ensure that Britain
retained a 'core' of merchant ships capable of meeting the requirements of
the the ministry of defence in any emergency.
Sir Nicholas said the government had rejected a suggestion by the British
Chamber of Shipping that a random test should be carried out this year to
establish the number of British and foreign merchant ships available for
charter by the ministry of defence.
