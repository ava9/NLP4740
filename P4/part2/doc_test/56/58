<F P=106> [Article by Lcdr. Yang Zhiqun (2799 1807 5028): "Officers' </F>
Forum--Brown Water, Blue Water--Thoughts on Naval Theory"] 
  [Text] Editor's Note: Based on the concern of our 
numerous readers about naval issues, this publication is coming 
out with a new exploratory column--"Officers' Forum," and 
inviting some officers to talk about their individual 
viewpoints. At the same time, we also hope that our numerous 
readers will make some suggestions regarding the new column. 
  This is a very small planet and one third of the planet's 
surface is black land. The other two thirds is blue sea. The 
black of the land extends to the blue of the sea and the blue 
sea washes the black land. Where they intersect the mixture 
becomes brown, and the brown water is the transition between the 
black land and the blue water. There is one very important 
point: All people live on land. Only by sailing a ship can we go 
down to the brown water and enter the blue water. 
  All newly-constructed ships enter the water from berths and 
docks on the land, and when construction is completed, all ships 
are sailed out to sea from ports on the land. All early fleets 
went out to the vast blue waters from brown water close to land. 
  When a ship is outfitted with weapons, it becomes a naval 
ship. Seamen undergo training to become sailors. Sailors and 
naval ships are organized into fleets, and under the command of 
an admiral, the fleet becomes a navy. 
  Navies all go down into the water from the land, first the 
brown water, then the blue water. 
  Navies establish bases on land. Naval ships and aircraft set 
out from the bases and attack and beat back the enemy in the 
brown water. 
  If the enemy in the brown water is defeated or driven off, 
the navy returns to its base and rests, reorganizes, and 
replenishes, and prepares for the next attack. If it is 
defeated, the navy escapes back to its base to hide. If it is 
not even secure in the base, the whole navy is annihilated. 
  The navy, stationed at the base, waits to annihilate the 
enemy in the brown water. The principal naval tactics are 
developed and formulated according to this line of thinking. 
  Bases are generally distributed equidistantly along the 
coast, and assault forces are deployed in key directions. Naval 
base forces are deployed in accordance with this principle. 
  Forces are composed of coastal based aircraft, submarine 
formations, and formations of surface ships and boats capable of 
carrying out an assault in brown water. Coordinated coastal 
defense fronts and small ships and boats can protect base 
defensive forces. The organization of the navy's basic forces is 
designed, planned, and developed in this way. 
  The overall plan of relying on the coastal land and keeping 
the brown water in view is called naval strategy. 
  But things generally are not like this at all. The navy by 
nature must be concerned about the blue water. 
  Blue water has had a very long maiden period. The first navy 
to bravely go into its depths and draw its sea-lanes was the 
Ming Dynasty eunuch Zheng and the Chinese fleet that he led 
across the Indian Ocean for the first time in the early 15th 
century. Eighty years later, for the first time the Portuguese 
navy went around the Cape of Good Hope and proceeded to the 
Orient and the Spanish navy crossed the Atlantic for the first 
time and passed through the West Indies and saw the Pacific 
Ocean. 
  The blue water has greeted the master and has greeted the 
hegemonist. It was almost immediately recognized and carved up. 
In 1494 a straight line was drawn along the 48th longitude 2,057 
kilometers west of the Cape Verde Archipelago formed an eastern 
and a western half, and divided up the great hegemony of 
Portugal and Spain. 
  The blue-water navy began from that. 
  The blue water has its own blue-water logic: The ocean does 
not belong to anyone. The ocean is the common property of 
everyone. In world competition, common property also is the 
property of the strong. Whoever is strong occupies it first, and 
whoever occupies it first, has it first. The blue water has its 
own blue-water stage. Time changes and is fickle with all 
leaders. The invincible Spanish fleet, the unsinkable imperial 
fleet, Holland, France, Japan, the Third Empire to the United 
States and Soviet nuclear navies of the Cold War, the blue-water 
hegemonists in blood and fire have torn each other apart and 
fought to the death, down through history it has never ended. 
  Blue water has its own blue-water rules. After a thousand 
years of evolution, the ancient land powers' concept of natural 
expansion of sovereignty into the sea ultimately evolved to the 
two modern principles of freedom of the high seas and 
sovereignty of territorial waters. With the current 
newly-arising countries, the development of technology to 
exploit the ocean, and the ever-growing demand for ocean 
resources, such concepts as the "archipelago principle," 
"contiguous zones," the "continental shelf," "special economic 
zones," and "ocean-bottom resources as the common legacy of 
humankind" arise. 
  The blue-water navy is completely different from the 
brown-water navy. 
  The first person who changed from the original single masted 
and single sailed ships to the multiple masted and multiple 
sailed ships was the first person to turn his sights to the blue 
water. But he still was a "blue-water person" looking at the 
blue water from the land. 
  In 1584 when the English Queen Elizabeth ordered the pirate 
admiral Drake to command a ship and attack the Spanish fleet in 
the West Indies, she was a "blue-water person" looking from the 
blue water to the blue water. And in this century after the 
commanding officer of the first guided missile nuclear 
submarine, the George Washington, in July 1960, successfully 
fired a Polaris intercontinental guided missile from his boat, 
he actually was the first "blue-water person" to look back at 
land from the blue water. 
  An historical regression also is a logical regression. The 
navy sailed to the blue water from the brown water to conquer 
the ocean, but conquering was by no means the objective. The 
ocean was conquered to use the ocean. The navy campaigned the 
length and breadth of the blue waters to use the ocean. But 
using still was not the objective. The use of the ocean was to 
counteract the land! 
  The navy went into the blue water for the blue water, but 
more than that it went into the blue water for the land. 
  The blue-water navy has its own blue-water navy thinking. 
  Because it goes into the blue water to use the blue water, 
it 
by no means takes what occurs on the sea as the goal of its 
actions, but it takes "control of the seas" as its goal. 
Luo-si-ji-er [5012 2448 1015 1422] said, "The function of a sea 
force is to seize and maintain control of the seas and put them 
to its own use, while preventing the enemy from controlling the 
seas." 
  But "controlling the seas," what objective can it achieve? 
  First, it protects commercial trading and ensures that 
trading sea-lanes are unimpeded. Secondly, it can use sea forces 
to capture trading transfer points, colonies, and bases in 
distant lands, as Alfred Mahan said. Old Mahan after all was a 
man of the last century. He could not understand the 
significance of blue water as a strategic nuclear base, nor 
could he understand the significance of blue water as a treasure 
house of resources. 
  He-de-li Bu-er [6378 1795 0448 1580 1422] said, "There are 
two other uses for sea forces that by no means depend on the 
basic objective of relying on the sea as a main line of 
transportation. The first is that certain countries utilize sea 
forces as a system of strategic nuclear weapons deployed at sea, 
or to resist enemy strategic weapons systems. The second 
objective has become more and more obvious only in the past ten 
years. A country uses military forces at sea to seize or expand 
its own ocean resources and to safeguard them from being 
threatened from the outside." 
  In its traditional meaning, navies go into blue water first 
for transportation lines, second for nuclear bases, and third 
for ocean resources. 
  The concept of using huge fleets to protect transportation 
lines at sea or the merchant fleet of one's own country is 
somewhat outmoded, because every large country should believe 
that the security of international sea-lanes can be maintained 
by more civilized and more intelligent means. The concept of 
maintaining a huge sea-based nuclear force in the blue water to 
obtain a reliable strategic deterrent is somewhat a product of 
the Cold War, at least after the Cold War, it cannot be ample 
reason for developing a huge blue-water navy. 
  The concept of developing a modern blue-water navy to join 
in 
the approaching fight for blue-water resources somewhat deviates 
from the spirit of the present international law of the sea. In 
international law the concept of no controlling land, in which 
blue-water resources are the common legacy of humankind and not 
to be had by whoever first occupies them, is a principle that is 
becoming generally accepted. 
  Blue water as before and blue-water navies today encounter 
perplexities. 
  Navies after all have not forgotten that they went into the 
blue water for the land. 
  When state sovereignty is limited to land borders, the navy 
patrols the brown water to safeguard the country's land. When 
such concepts in modern international law of the sea as 
"contiguous zones," "continental shelf," and "special economic 
zones" began to extend the legal meaning of state sovereignty to 
brown waters, the implications for the country's land that the 
navy should safeguard changed and by direct inference, the navy 
in the new meaning of safeguarding the country's land patrolled 
the blue water. 
  When the present world was divided into two large opposing 
blocs, each navy to contend for world hegemony made its bid in 
blue water, because either side could encounter its adversary in 
blue water, and one side need only completely withdraw from the 
arena and the the other side could realize its aspiration of 
controlling the blue water. When one side ultimately realizes 
this aspiration, it has no adversary in the arena and its navy 
does not patrol the blue water to drive out the adversary, but 
patrols the blue water to take advantage of the blue water to 
offer resistance close to its country's land. 
  When a country's security is military security, the navy 
patrols the blue water as a means of military combat. As the 
world enters a new era, and state security is more importantly 
expressed as economic security and environmental security, the 
navy with its unique characteristic of "using non-combat forms," 
must patrol the blue water in a new guise as economic and 
diplomatic emissary and as guardian of environmental security. 
  When a country outside of brown waters asserts sovereignty 
over land or islands, its navy will patrol the blue water. 
  When a country still maintains a nuclear deterrent as the 
content of its national security strategy, its navy will patrol 
the blue water. 
  When a country has the humiliation of being chased out of an 
ocean, today when it also has an extremely great oceanic 
interest, its navy will patrol the blue water. 
  Sticking to its old ways, the navy will patrol the blue 
water. 
  This is a very small planet and the planet's surface has 
black land, brown water, and blue water. 
  The international law of the sea today stipulates thus: the 
black land is yours, the blue water is everyone's, and the brown 
water is yours and everyone's. 
  Oceanic politics today is expressed thus: Guard yours and 
categorize everyone's. 
  The enlightenment from historical experience today is: If 
you 
cannot occupy yours, it is someone else's. 
  The next century has this prediction: The black land belongs 
to the dried up past, the brown water belongs to the unfolding 
present, and only the blue water is the hopeful future. 
  The navy is a legal person in the law of the sea, is a tool 
in oceanic politics, is a student of historical experience, and 
is a harbinger of the next century. 
  Brown water, blue water, the navy patrols in them.
