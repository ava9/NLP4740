Section 708 of the Defense Production Act, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2158); Executive Order 12919, 59 FR 29525, June

Need for this Agreement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_1. The Administrator has found, in accordance with Section 708(c)(1), that conditions exist which may pose a direct
threat to the national defense of the United States or its preparedness programs and, under the provisions of Section
708, has certified to the Attorney General that a standby voluntary agreement for utilization of intermodal shipping
services/systems is necessary for the national defense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The quantity of military dry cargo (unit equipment, sustaining supplies and ammunition) to be moved for support
of a military contingency, national emergency, or war in a foreign area could exceed the shipping capacity normally
available for charter or use from the commercial sector. It is desirable to avoid the disruptive effects of ship requisition
and of intermodal equipment allocation so long as military requirements can be met by voluntary cooperation between
the maritime industry and the Federal government. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Chairman, has issued
a finding that dry cargo capacity to meet national defense requirements cannot be provided by the industry through
a voluntary agreement having less anti-competitive effects or without a voluntary agreement.

History of this Agreement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_The concept of this Agreement originated in discussions between MARAD and DOD officials on arrangements to promote
timely availability of ships, equipment and management services needed to operate them. Most U.S.-flag shipping
companies operate ships as part of an integrated land/ocean transportation system. In times of emergency, DOD needs
not only vessels and intermodal equipment, but also the management expertise to operate such assets as transportation
systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1101 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) will be amended in accordance with H.R. 4003 to provide for operating agreements between vessel owners or operators
and the Secretary. This Agreement will constitute an Emergency Preparedness Program within the meaning of the amended
Title VI of the Act proposed in H.R. 4003. This Agreement will constitute a sealift readiness program when approved
by the SecDef and will meet all the conditions set forth under Section 909. An ocean carrier which is a Participant in
this Agreement is eligible for award of a Shipping Agreement or a Container Agreement from MSC without enrollment
in any other program. An ocean carrier eligible to participate in this Agreement but which elects not to do so is subject
to enrollment in the MSC Sealift Readiness Program (SRP) if it (1) receives operating-differential subsidy or construction-differential
subsidy or (2) wishes to carry DOD cargo. A carrier, while a Participant in this Agreement, will be subject only to the
provisions of this Agreement and not to the provisions of the SRP.
