Name? 'Elizabeth Windsor.' (A Social Services officer is interviewing the
next woman in line for an emergency supplementary payment.) 'Address?'
'Number Nine Hellebore Close' 'Former address?' 'Buckingham Palace, The
Mall.' 'What were you doing there?' 'I was being the Queen.' 'You were in an
institution? We can't give you any money.'
Sue Townsend's 1992 bestseller The Queen and I is a dark joke, a barbed
dream of republicanism in which Mrs Elizabeth Windsor and family learn to
live in the modern hell of a council estate in the Midlands. Now it has
become a play, which has just had its premiere, neatly, in the Midlands (at
the Leicester Haymarket), and will tour England and Wales before reaching
London's Royal Court on June 7. The play is different in many details from
the novel. Updated to suit recent Royal developments, and including a few
songs (too few - phew - to qualify it as a musical), it is funny, touching,
shrewd.
Part of the fun of The Queen and I (on page or stage) is to do with Royal
gossip. How would Margaret cope? Philip? The answer in either case is
wickedly amusing. In the stage version the adulterous Charles, who has been
allocated a single person flat, soon shacks up with Leanne, the most
promiscuous girl on the estate, and becomes a good dad to her illegitimate
baby. Diana starts a flirtation with Fitzroy, a local black, and works out
with him ('Once your muscle tone goes, you may as well be dead'). The stage
Queen and I is also mildly feminist: which leads to its funniest scene - a
women's group in which Liz, Diana and neighbours practise assertiveness -
and its best song, What Makes the Husbands Leave Home?' And the fact that
Liz Windsor herself turns out to be matey, outspoken, decent, hard-working,
will please royalists as well as republicans.
But the stage version of The Queen and I is more overtly socialist than the
novel. Some of its stylised versions of gangland chants are trite - a
simplistic effort to understand the gang mentality that sounds in fact
condescending. Elsewhere, however, the realities of council estate life are
caught with realism, as well as humour. It proves both gratifying and
credible (not to mention ironic) that, on her first Christmas Day in her new
home, Mrs Windsor of Hell(ebore) Close, rallies and makes a televised speech
to the nation - no, not the Queen's Speech, de haut en bas, but the reverse:
a pensioner's appeal on behalf of those who, like herself, are making do on
inadequate benefits.
Max Stafford-Clark directs. The fun of all the performances lies less in
their precision of Royal mimicry (though Doon Mackichan makes very witty use
of Diana's tricks with her eyes) than in the impish vigour with which they
bring them to life. Thus Mrs Philomena Toussaint (David Howey) and Mrs Vi
Toby (Carole Hayman) become as vivid to us as their ex-Royal neighbours. The
songs, by Mickey Gallagher and Ian Dury, are the least surefire element of
the show. A certain glee comes from hearing the Windsors and their
neighbours do a rap number, but less than you might hope.
The fine cast is led by Pam Ferris as the Queen - an outstanding
performance. She brings out some surprisingly serious dimensions. Talking
nostalgically to a vision of her old nanny, she suddenly exclaims softly,
'Crawfie - we lived in Paradise'. The line - a gentle echo of Lear's 'I have
ta'en too little care of this' - brings a real pang. At the same time, she
is as good as everyone else in the play's element of naughty caricature. The
way she uses her corgi on that Social Services officer (you have to see
this) is the play's funniest moment.
The Queen and I continues at the Haymarket, Leicester, until April 16. In a
double bill with Jim Cartwright's Road, it tours to Bath, Cardiff, Hull,
Woking, Blackpool, Norwich and the Royal Court Theatre, London.
