Cape Town's spruced-up harbour

THERE ARE at least three reasons to stay away from most of the world's
famous redeveloped waterfronts: too many people; too many architectural
cliches; too much junk food.
Cape Town's bijou harbour district must have been built for snobs like me.
The crowds are manageable - and reflect an easy racial mix seen nowhere else
in South Africa - the architecture is tastefully understated, with the
minimum of Victorian frills and fretwork; and although fast food is a bit of
a failing, the harbour's fish restaurants easily maintain the upmarket tone.
The name is implausible: the Victoria and Alfred waterfront. Surely, some
sort of post-colonial joke by the developer? But the Cape Town harbour owes
its existence to this unlikely pair: Queen Victoria's second son, Prince
Alfred, tipped the first load of stone to start construction of the harbour
breakwater in 1860. Ships rounding the Cape of Good Hope found shelter first
in the Alfred basin, and later in a second basin named after the Queen.
By 1990, the warehouses and transport sheds built to service Cape shipping
in the late Victorian and Edwardian periods had sunk into dereliction.
Trendy Capetonians made an occasional pilgrimage to the waterfront's one
seedy fish restaurant - the Harbour Cafe - but generally avoided the
dangerous and decaying port.
Since then Transnet, the state-owned transport corporation, and private
developers have invested around R400m (Pounds 81.7m) to redevelop the
waterfront area for tourism, shopping and upmarket habitation. More than 1m
people visit the V &amp; A waterfront every month, and several thousand more
work there, in restored Victorian buildings overlooking the port. The first
residents are due to move into harbour flats and townhouses by 1995.
Cape Town's natural advantages made it an obvious choice to join the world
trend to waterfront redevelopment: where Boston harbour has a freeway as
scenic backdrop, Cape Town has the granite wonder of Table Mountain. The
active fishing port contributes scent, sound, and atmosphere. Harbour cruise
boats stop at Robben Island, where tourists can visit Nelson Mandela's
former cell.
Cape Town retains many Cape Dutch and imperial Victorian buildings. Port
architecture is mainly late Victorian or Edwardian, while new structures
echo the lines of the antique buildings.
Even the Victoria Wharf shopping centre - designed as a light and airy
version of a Victorian railway station, complete with floor tiles made from
original period moulds - scores high on the scale of snob appeal.
In this land of the glitzy shopping mall Victoria Wharf provides a nice mix
of trendy women's fashion boutiques and African crafts, ethnic food stalls
and proletarian movie houses. Africans and whites mingle without the
suspicion and fear which poison inner-city shopping in Johannesburg.
The African National Congress initially condemned the project as a
playground for rich whites: but as the movement learns to throw off the
hair-shirt of liberation politics, it has begun to realise that even South
Africa needs its playgrounds - and what more delightful one than the V &amp; A
waterfront, a place of historic charm and modern opulence where South
Africans can go to escape, for at least a few hours, the birth pangs of
their new multi-racial nation.
