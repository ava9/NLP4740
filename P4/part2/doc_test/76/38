FT  27 NOV 92 / Taxing the Monarchy: The Royal income and perks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROYAL INCOME AND PERKS
Income from property: Income from the 36,500 acres of the Duchy of Lancaster
was pounds 3.1m last year. This is used to fund the privy purse, which pays
minor royals and staff pensions. The Sandringham estate provides about
pounds 600,000 pf private income. The Queen also derives some income,
possibly around pounds 1m, from her stud farm and winnings of her horses.
Investments: Estimates of the value of the Queen's investment portfolio,
managed by stockbrokers Rowe and Pitman, vary from under pounds 50m to
almost pounds 600m. This is based on a portfolio said to be worth about
pounds 30m in 1971. The higher estimates assume dividends have all been
reinvested, which is unlikely. Income from the portfolio is estimated at
pounds 1m to pounds 42m.
Perks: The royal yacht, Britannia, costs the Ministry of Defence about
pounds 9.5m a year. Government departments spent about pounds 2.5m on the
royal train last year, pounds 21.8m on palaces and residences, and pounds
6.9m on the Queen's Flight. Other perks of the job include additional travel
costs, around 400 out of more than 1,000 personal staff and security cover.
PAYMENT FOR ROYAL DUTIES
Civil list: The Queen is the biggest recipient of funds from the civil list,
receiving pounds 7.9m this year, due to rise to pounds 10.4m by the end of
the century. Next comes the Queen Mother, with pounds 640,000, and Prince
Philip with pounds 360,000. They are the three who will continue to be paid
by the state under the new arrangements. Other current recipients are the
Duke of York, whose allowance was pounds 250,000, in addition to his naval
salary, which is fully taxable. Prince Edward got about pounds 100,000, the
Princess Royal pounds 230,000, Princess Margaret pounds 220,000 and Princess
Alice pounds 90,000.
The last five royals will continue to be included in the civil list, but the
Queen will reiburse the Treasury the full value of their allowances. A total
of around pounds 5.1m will be repaid from income from the Duchy of
Lancaster.
Royal cut back: The Queen, Prince Philip and the the Queen Mother will
continue to receive money from the tax payer. The rest of the Royal Family
will be paid for by the Queen.
