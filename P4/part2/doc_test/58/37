has started an official visit. During the first day with his 
counterpart, he chaired a working meeting dedicated to the 
Maghreb and to the problems of the Mediterranean area. Solana 
explained the position of the Spanish Government on the dialogue 
between countries of the European Union and those of the Arab 
Maghreb Union. 
  Previously, Solana discussed with the Tunisian interior and 
justice ministers problems related to security in the
