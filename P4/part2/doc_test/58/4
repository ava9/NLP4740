  [Text] The Spanish Government will maintain its current 
level of official cooperation with Cuba in 1994, despite the 
difficult straits the Spanish economy is now experiencing. Jose 
San Gil, the Spanish ambassador to Havana, said that despite the 
economic difficulties which we are all going through I can 
assure you that the Spanish Government considers it a duty to 
maintain its cooperation this year. 
  According to the ambassador, Spanish cooperation from Madrid 
to Cuba amounted to approximately seven million dollars in 1993. 
This reflects the Spanish Government's political decision. 
Beyond the official interpretation, this should be seen as a 
mark of the interest and affection of the Spanish people. 
  Ambassador San Gil added that about 120 Cubans are trained 
or 
retrained every year in Spain. Furthermore, all the projects 
currently under way will continue.
