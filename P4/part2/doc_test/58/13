Mr Roberto Robana, Cuba's foreign minister, is waging a week-long diplomatic
offensive in Madrid to rescue the credibility of his government, but so far
has met only reservations from Spanish officials and hostility from Cuban
opposition groups, writes Tom Burns in Madrid.
Spain is trying to broker a transition towards political pluralism and a
market economy in Cuba. Madrid is urging on Mr Robana's 'profound and rapid'
reforms. The talks follow a Cuban-US meeting in New York last week which
yielded an agreement to halt the flow of Cuban illegal migrants to the US.
Madrid, which has played a discreet economic advisory role to the Cuban
government over the past year, is understood to be particularly disappointed
that a package of measures to deregulate the Caribbean state's economy,
drawn up by Mr Carlos Solchaga, a Spanish former finance minister, has been
largely ignored in Havana.
Mr Javier Solana, Spain's foreign minister, warned after extended talks with
Mr Robana that 'a possible solution today may no longer be possible
tomorrow'.
A spokeswoman for the Cuban minister, who will stay in Spain until tomorrow,
acknowleged yesterday that differences had emerged in discussions with
Madrid.
Cuban opposition politicians and human rights groups abroad claim that
individual, private meetings of Mr Robana and selected Cubans from the US,
organised by the Spanish government in Madrid, are merely cosmetic.
'There is no undertaking by (Cuban President) Fidel (Castro) to meet the
internal opposition in Cuba,' said Mr Antonio Guedes, an executive member of
the Cuban Democratic Platform, an opposition grouping of liberal, Christian
democratic and social democratic parties.
The platform, which supports the US trade embargo on Havana but is seen as
moderate, had signalled its willingness to meet Mr Robana when approached by
the Spanish foreign ministry. However, the Cuban minister rejected the
feeler.
