  [Text] Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana has explained 
the agreements reached by NATO and the Partnership for Peace 
[PFP] to the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Congress of 
Deputies. 
  Javier Solana highlighted the Spanish Government's decision 
to take part in cooperation agreements reached by the Western 
allies with Central and East European countries. Javier Solana: 
  [Begin Solana recording] The government wants to play an 
active role in these cooperation activities linking the allies 
to Central and East European countries. Our country has already 
signed several cooperation agreements with Central European 
countries, which establish bilateral military cooperation 
programs; we will try to strengthen these programs. 
  Spain has achieved -- in several cases -- development in 
certain fields that is comparable to that in these countries. 
We think that we can add experiences in the defense field that 
can be particularly useful to these countries. 
  At the same time, and more specifically in the PFP 
framework, 
we will also take part in other multilateral cooperation 
activities with other Alliance member countries. [end recording]
