  [Text] During a brief stopover in Madrid, Guatemalan 
Foreign Minister [Gladys] Maritza Ruiz de Vielman called for the 
support of the Spanish authorities for a peace agreement between 
the Guatemalan guerrilla movement and the government. Hector 
Arenas reports: 
  [Arenas] The Guatemalan Government has asked the Spanish 
Government for support to try to attain a definitive peace 
agreement this year in talks it is holding in Mexico with the 
guerrilla movement. Negotiations started in Spain, in El 
Escorial [near Madrid], a few years ago. The request for 
support was made by recently appointed Guatemalan Foreign 
Minister Marithza Ruiz de Vielman during a short stay in Madrid, 
in which she held a meeting with Foreign Minister Javier Solana. 
The Guatemalan minister described the meeting as being very 
positive. 
  [Begin de Vielman recording] We find it positive that they 
are very favorable to the beginning of this new phase, and we 
believe that Spain will be among those countries watching this 
process closely, and that they will support us. [end recording] 
  [Arenas] Also, during this meeting Guatemala asked the 
European countries to lift present restrictions on the import of 
tropical fruit, especially bananas. Finally, the Guatemalan 
minister said that reports last week on the alleged plotting of 
a coup d'etat against President Leon Carpio were lies.
