  [Text] Algerian Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri is 
visiting Spain, where he met King Juan Carlos and Prime Minister 
Felipe Gonzalez this morning. This afternoon he met the Foreign 
Minister Javier Solana. Algeria has asked Spain for cooperation 
in the fight against terrorism. Over to our diplomatic 
correspondent, Pedro Fernandez Cespedes. 
  [Cespedes] Good evening. Specifically, Algeria asked Spain 
to control the flux of people who might form terrorist groups or 
networks abroad. Algerian Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri 
added that Algeria's security is inseparable from that of other 
neighboring Mediterranean countries. According to Dembri, 
Algeria is not on the brink of civil war, as is often said in 
the media. He suggested to journalists they stop reporting on 
the Algerian situation in such a sensationalist way. 
  Spain, through its Foreign Minister Javier Solana, asked 
Algeria to solve its serious political crisis through a swift, 
open, and sincere dialogue, while at the same time offering its 
cooperation. 
  [Begin Solana recording] The fight against terrorism is not 
the fight of a single country. And so he Salah Dembri will have 
Spain's support in this battle. [end recording]
