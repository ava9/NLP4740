Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, has thrown his weight around
before at European summits but never has he pushed brinkmanship quite so far
as he will today at Essen. When Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission, criticised national governments on Wednesday for 'taking
hostages' in order to get their own way in the Union, he had Mr Gonzalez in
mind.
Mr Gonzalez's offence is that he served notice in a letter to German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl last week that Madrid would block the EU's
enlargement (to incorporate, Austria, Finland and Sweden next month) if
Spain, together with Portugal, failed to obtain legal guarantees on its
inclusion in the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) by January 1 1995. The
Spanish premier is now poised to repeat his threat verbally to Mr Kohl in
the presence of Mr Delors and of the others meeting in the central Ruhr
town.
Although the CFP is not on the Essen agenda, 'the issue is very likely to
come up,' said Mr Miguel Gil, the Spanish government spokesman.
A veteran of a score of European summits, Mr Gonzalez dug his heels in over
revenue raising at Maastricht in 1991, over structural funds at Edinburgh a
year later and most recently over qualified majority voting during the Greek
presidency earlier this year.
On this occasion, however, Mr Gonzalez has a powerful legislative back-up to
his obstinacy. In October the Spanish parliament voted not to ratify the
accession of the three new members unless Spain first obtained guarantees
lifting restrictions on its fishing rights in EU waters.
'The prime minister wrote to Chancellor Kohl that the vote had been
unanimous and unequivocal and that he (Mr Kohl) should therefore concentrate
on the fishing issue,' said Mr Gil. Mr Carlos Westendorp, Madrid's EU
secretary of state, was more emphatic: 'Our position is well entrenched.
Parliament has closed off any retreats.'
Mr Kohl may be irked by the sight of a Spanish deep-sea trawler muddying the
clear waters of enlargement. Madrid, however, insists that it is up to the
German presidency to break the deadlock at the EU's fishing council, where a
series of bitter arguments continue to hold up what the EU had agreed in
principle months ago as part of the enlargement package.
In a concession allowing Norway to preserve its own fishing grounds, the
Twelve agreed in March to bring forward the entry of Spain and Portugal to
the CFP from 2003 to 1996 and to settle the terms of their inclusion by the
end of this year.
The fact that the Norwegian people in a referendum rejected joining the
Union does not in Madrid's view, alter a single sentence of the March
commitment. But the EU's council of fishing ministers meets on December
19-20 amid strong disagreements over what the CFP will look like with the
inclusion of Spain and Portugal and the fear that an 11th-hour consensus may
prove impossible. 'This month's council is the last cartridge because we've
used up all the others,' said Mr Westendorp. 'It has to receive a clear
message from Essen.'
Clarity is all too necessary because the fishing council has become confused
over the Commission's proposals to use the extension of the CFP to introduce
stricter rules on where and how trawlers operate.
The new rules are disliked by Spain, which has been subjected to similar
restrictions ever since it became Europe's 12th member in 1986, as much as
by the rest who view them as intrusive and unworkable. In addition, Ireland
and the UK have not abandoned their hopes of keeping Spain's 200-strong
fleet of large trawlers out of the 'Western Waters' on the grounds that the
'Irish Box' is a sensitive zone requiring biological protection.
The Irish-British objections cause considerable anger in Madrid, where
officials say the insatiable Spanish demand for fish has revitalised the
industry in the EU. 'Ireland exported 600 tons of fish to Spain in 1985 and
last year it exported 6.5bn tons, all of them high price and high quality, '
says Mr Rafael Conde, Madrid's director general of fishing.
At issue, in Spain's view, is whether the EU has a genuine common fishing
policy or a set of national ones and, specifically, whether the Union is
prepared to end the discrimination that it imposes on two of its present
members before it accepts any new ones. 'We must have an internal
house-cleaning over the fishing business before enlargement,' said Mr Conde.
