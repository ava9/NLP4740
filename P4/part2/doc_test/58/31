  [Text] Madrid, 14 Jan (PL) Isabel Allende, Cuban vice 
minister of foreign relations, said today bilateral relations 
between Spain and Cuba are good and constructive. 
  Allende, who is on an official visit to Spain, said the two 
countries have different points of view on certain issues. She 
told PRENSA LATINA that "the important thing is, however, the 
attitude one takes to solve problems and overcome difficulties." 
  During her stay in Madrid, the deputy foreign minister held 
meetings with high-ranking officials from the Spanish Foreign 
Ministry, with whom she discussed issues such as progress at the 
bilateral commissions on scientific and cultural exchange and 
technical and industrial assistance. 
  Regarding an upcoming trip by Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina, following an invitation from his Spanish colleague, 
Javier Solana, Allende said the visit will serve to develop 
further the ties with Spain, one of the Caribbean island's main 
commercial partners. 
  Allende said "we are working to strengthen our ties, and 
there is nothing keeping us from doing so, based on, of course, 
the principles of mutual respect and noninterference." 
  The diplomat addressed the importance the local press had 
given her visit to the Iberian nation, which she sees as proof 
of the interest there is in her country. She regretted, 
however, the appearance of information she termed manipulative 
in certain newspapers which she considers prestigious. 
  To illustrate her statement, she mentioned an article 
published yesterday in an EL PAIS issue. The article reported a 
meeting she held with a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official, 
during which they discussed Spanish claims for the release of 
several people imprisoned in Cuba. 
  Allende said "I am concerned that they highlighted [words 
indistinct] minimal time and attention, which by no means 
constitutes the essence of Spanish-Cuban relations." 
  She also criticized a report carried yesterday in the Madrid 
daily EL MUNDO that listed recommendations Economy Minister 
Carlos Solchaga allegedly made to the Cuban Government upon 
returning from a trip to the Caribbean nation last year. 
  The Spanish Foreign Ministry flatly denied the reports 
today, 
stating that the newspaper's article "seriously twisted the 
content and meaning of the original document." 
  According to EL MUNDO, Solchaga presented a "secret 
document" 
to authorities in Havana in which Spain listed several 
recommendations for an economic solution to the island's 
economic crisis. 
  In commenting on the possible economic formulas, Solchaga 
said "Cuba receives visitors [word indistinct] recommendations 
regarding measures to overcome the current economic crisis, but 
it is the government--as the most interested party in resolving 
the crisis--who must decide on which measures to adopt." 
  In answering a question from reporters during a news 
conference in Madrid, Allende said the U.S. blockade against 
Cuba is illegal. She added it violates international laws and 
contradicts basic premises of a market economy, which depends on 
the ability to trade, to establish a business and to navigate 
freely. 
  She also admitted that since the beginning of Bill Clinton's 
administration, Washington is using less aggressive language 
toward the island but void of any indication of a change in U.S. 
policy.
