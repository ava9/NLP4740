  [Text] The Spanish Foreign Ministry's directorate general 
of foreign policy for Africa and the Middle East has been 
assessing since this morning the speech by King Hassan II of 
Morocco in which he said that the solution to the dispute 
concerning the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla in North 
Africa cannot wait any longer. 
  Meanwhile Javier Ruperez, the foreign affairs spokesman of 
the conservative Popular Party, today called on the Spanish 
Government to be very firm in its response to the veiled threats 
made by King Hassan II of Morocco yesterday on the Ceuta and 
Melilla dispute. The spokesman for the Spanish conservative 
opposition calls on the government to remind the king of Morocco 
once again of the constitutional terms in which the territorial 
integrity of Spain is understood.
