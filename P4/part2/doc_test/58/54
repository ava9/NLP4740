<F P=106> [Julio Riquelme report: "Gonzalez Avoids Linking His Future </F>
to 12 June Outcome"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez yesterday 
opened the election campaign for 12 June with an appearance on 
the Antena 3 television channel. On several occasions, Gonzalez 
was at pains to dissociate his political future and that of his 
government from the results of the dual European and Andalusian 
elections, acknowledging only that "if there is a catastrophe," 
there is a possibility of reconsidering the current situation. 
  In the opinion of Gonzalez, each election's results should 
be 
confined to its own sphere, even though some political forces -- 
which he did not name -- wish to turn 12 June into a primary 
election. Continuing this line of argument, Gonzalez denied that 
bad results could cause his resignation. 
  Previously, when asked about his state of mind with respect 
to the successive corruption cases, the prime minister asserted 
that "I have been in power for many years, and I know that my 
responsibility is to carry through our blueprint for the 
country, tackling both the corruption cases and the economic 
crisis." 
  Nevertheless, Gonzalez stated that "in the political sphere, 
my most difficult moment was the NATO referendum, and in the 
personal sphere, it has been these days with the corruption 
scandals." "I have no limits," he asserted, "in combating 
corruption, except those characteristic of a rule-of-law state, 
which it is very difficult to blackmail," referring to Luis 
Roldan. 
<H5>  Trust Betrayed </H5>
  After asserting, referring to the Roldan and Rubio cases, 
that "institutions stand above individuals," praising the work 
performed by both the Civil Guard and the Bank of Spain, 
Gonzalez reiterated that personal trust had been betrayed 
because of a lack of democratic controls, entailing political 
responsibilities which have been discharged -- referring to the 
resignations of Asuncion, Corcuera, and Solchaga. "It has been 
difficult for me to accept the betrayal, and I have had a very 
bad time," he asserted. "We resign," he said, in a clear 
reference to the People's Party: "Others do not resign." 
  Gonzalez said that it is very difficult to foresee the 
emergence of new scandals, although he pointed out that as prime 
minister "I have approved over 1,000 appointments of senior 
officials, and only two or three have disappointed me." The 
prime minister did not rule out the possibility that somebody is 
directing "a trickle of news" connected with corruption, stating 
that "some people do not even like the democratic system." 
  He showed himself opposed to the proposal made yesterday by 
Democratic Union of Catalonia leader Duran Lleida, for making a 
"fresh start" in the matter of party funding, since he deems it 
necessary for all citizens to know the origin of the parties' 
funds, and to create legal arrangements to ensure their 
transparency, involving an austerity which he deems necessary, 
plus increased powers for the National Audit Office. 
<H5>  Disenchantment </H5>
  The prime minister said he realizes that both the economic 
crisis and corruption, as well as the "lengthy period" of 
Socialist government, have caused disenchantment among many 
citizens, and so "it will be necessary to appeal to people's 
consciences to vote 12 June." 
  Felipe Gonzalez asserted that over the past few days, 
"rather 
than a political crisis, there has been political confusion, 
uncertainty, and anxiety. But it is very strange that this is 
being said by the People's Party, who are the only people to 
deny the country's recovery." Gonzalez said stability is needed 
for this recovery, and so in a further reference to the People's 
Party he described it as "crass" for them to say "the opposite 
of what even bodies and institutions very distant politically 
from the Spanish Socialist Workers Party are stating." 
  In the purely economic sphere, the prime minister asserted 
that the worst of the crisis is now over; "we will lose no jobs 
in 1994, and 1995 will be a good year." He used this argument 
to launch another attack on the People's Party for refusing to 
acknowledge the good figures and for increasing confusion by 
even asserting "that there will be a general election this year, 
when not even 12 months have passed since the last general 
election." 
  "We will win well in Andalusia," Gonzalez asserted, "because 
the Andalusians have no inclination to vote for the right." He 
denied the existence of a Rural Employment Plan captive vote, 
acknowledging that "patronage would be another form of 
corruption." 
  In a final personal reference, Gonzalez asserted that "for a 
long time several European leaders have been urging me to leave 
the Spanish Government and become the European Commission 
president. Now they are no longer urging me," he concluded, 
because "I have decided to remain in charge of my 
responsibilities as prime minister."
