  [Text] The Spanish Government has given to understand that 
in Brussels on Tuesday [15 March] a fisheries agreement could be 
reached with Norway, which would permit this Nordic country's 
entry into the European Union [EU]. However, according to 
official sources quoted today, Saturday, by the Madrid daily EL 
PAIS, there is no compromise in sight on institutional 
adaptations and changes in voting. Meanwhile, the Spanish 
Government has won the support of all the political parties, 
including those of the opposition, in the joint congress-senate 
commission of the Spanish Cortes [parliament] for the position 
being upheld in Brussels in the face of its Community partners. 
  Today, the aforementioned Madrid newspaper carries an 
article 
by Vicente Albero, the Spanish minister of agriculture, 
fisheries and food, in which he reflects on the common fisheries 
policy and defends the Spanish position as regards its partners. 
Albero reiterates the point that on the subject of fisheries, 
Spain has a great interest in a country like Norway joining the 
European Union, but he stresses that this does not justify the 
abolition of the common wealth by pleading geographical 
exceptionality or greater efficiency of management of resources. 
In his article, the Spanish minister of agriculture and 
fisheries recalls that the Spanish fishing industry is the 
biggest and most complex of the whole of the European Union. He 
warns that Community enlargement must not and cannot represent a 
step backwards as regards what has hitherto been achieved.
