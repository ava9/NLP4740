  [Text] Designated Foreign Minister Gabriel Lewis Galindo, 
who leaves the country on a 15-day vacation today, revealed 
yesterday that Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez will meet 
with Panamanian President-Elect Ernesto Perez Balladares in 
Madrid, Spain, on 10 July, when the latter starts an official 
four-day visit in that country. 
  The possibility of Spanish investments in Panama, support 
for 
the tourism program to be implemented by the new Panamanian 
Government, and other economic and social issues are part of the 
agenda to be discussed by Perez Balladares and Gonzalez, Lewis 
Galindo reported. He also said the banana issue will not be 
absent even though it is well-known that this is a very complex 
problem and could never be resolved during this trip. 
  "The main purpose of this visit to Spain is to look for a 
rapprochement with Panama's traditional friends, such as the 
Spaniards and especially their president, Felipe Gonzalez," 
Lewis Galindo stated. 
  The designated foreign minister, however, did not reject the 
possibility that the Democratic Revolutionary Party will make 
efforts to be reinstated into the Socialist International [SI], 
an organization of political parties with a great deal of 
prestige. Felipe Gonzalez is one of the SI's most important 
leaders. 
  He added that President Perez Balladares will be accompanied 
by designated Planning Minister Guillermo Chapman, designated 
Presidency Minister Raul Arango, designated State Security 
Minister Jose Luis Sosa, former President Aristides Royo, and 
Mario Velasquez, the president-elect's spokesman.
