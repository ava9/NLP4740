cabinet has the stomach for the fight

THE NEW Spanish government of Mr Felipe Gonzalez took office yesterday and
was greeted with a degree of scepticism by the financial community. Doubts
were cast on its stability and on its willingness to apply measures to curb
Spain's worsening recession.
Mr Gonzalez's Socialist party (PSOE) failed to win an overall majority in
last month's general election, and despite extensive talks with leaders of
the Basque and Catalan nationalist parties, the prime minister has failed to
persuade either group to join his government as a junior partner.
The absence of the nationalist parties, which would have assured Mr Gonzalez
of firm parliamentary support, lends a provisional look to the new
government. Both groups may change their minds, however, and try to join the
cabinet after the 1994 budget is approved following the the summer recess.
Mr Gonzalez's new team is built around Mr Narcis Serra, the deputy prime
minister in the previous government who is now given the additional
responsibility of co-ordinating economic policy. Mr Pedro Solbes, a
technocrat and a non-Socialist, has been promoted from the agriculture
ministry to run the economy and finance ministry.
Neither Mr Serra, a plodding consensus politician, nor Mr Solbes, who has a
record as an interventionist in defence of state industry, is viewed as a
tough personality willing to take on the challenges of a recession. A senior
Madrid corporate lawyer likened the new economic team yesterday to 'an
aspirin to cure a cancer'.
The difficulties facing the domestic economy have been underlined this week
by estimates which put the general budget deficit at 7 per cent of gross
domestic product. That is double the figure outlined in Spain's Emu
convergence plan and compares with 4.4 per cent last year. Year-on-year GDP
rose by 0.5 in the first quarter and growth forecasts for 1993 range between
zero and minus 1 per cent.
Inflation is nevertheless rising - it was up by 0.4 per cent in June to give
an underlying 12 month rate of 5.9 per cent - despite the recession and a
steep rise in unemployment. The number of registered jobless rose last month
by 35,351, the first June increase for 10 years, and the total number of job
seekers now stands at more than 2.5m, representing 16.6 per cent of the
working population.
Echoing a widely shared view in the financial community, Madrid stockbroker
FG forecast that the new government would avoid head-on collisions with the
unions, would do little to reduce the budget deficit and would deregulate
only under direct pressure from Brussels.
The one positive signal to the markets in the new government is the
exclusion from the cabinet of the left wing of the PSOE which is championed
by the deputy party leader, Mr Alfonso Guerra. This is a second humiliation
suffered by the so-called guerristas. Mr Gonzalez has already foisted Mr
Carlos Solchaga, the former economy minister and a bitter foe of the
leftwing Socialists, on to the PSOE, as the party's leader and chief
spokesman in parliament.
Mr Gonzalez has retained as foreign minister Mr Javier Solana, who is no
friend of Mr Guerra, and he brought into the cabinet minor-ranking social
democrats, identified with the moderate wing of the party, as well as a
total of six independents, three of them women.
It is likely now that the prime minister will continue to wage his war on
the left wing by calling a party congress later this year or early in 1994.
The guerrista faction, which holds most of the senior positions within the
party, has been at the centre of scandals over illicit campaign funds that
have severely embarrassed Mr Gonzalez.
Should the latter deal a definitive blow to Mr Guerra's camp, and also meet
home rule demands made by the nationalists when he draws up next year's
budget, the way will be smoothed for the entry of the Basques and Catalans
into the cabinet.
A broad-based coalition government would have its stability assured over the
next four years. Given the more market-orientated policies of both the
Basques and the Catalans, such a government would help to boost confidence
about the economic policies that Mr Gonzalez may pursue in his fourth term
in office.
