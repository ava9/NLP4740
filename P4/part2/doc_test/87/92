IRISH theatre has not been so strong since the days of George Bernard Shaw
and Sean O'Casey. Neither television, video nor the recession seem to have
an adverse effect on it.
If export is an indication of success, there are at present three Irish
plays in London's West End: Dancing at Lughnasa and Philadelphia, Here I
Come, both by Brian Friel, and Someone to Watch Over Me by Frank McGuinness.
By the end of the year the latter will have joined the former on Broadway.
Three Irish plays were awarded Fringe First awards at the Edinburgh Festival
this year.
Ever since the founding of the Abbey Theatre, in 1904, theatre has had a
central place in Irish life. Indigenous Irish theatre belongs to the 20th
century (all previous dramatists are relegated to the 'Anglo-Irish'
category). So vital was the Abbey to national life that JM Synge's reference
to underwear - the text of Playboy of the Western World mentioned a shift -
caused a riot in 1907. Another riot, in 1926, took place at the opening of
O'Casey's The Plough and the Stars. In both cases the audience felt that the
play had insulted national self esteem by questioning Irish patriotism,
chastity and the Irish character in general.
Contemporary playwrights continue to be preoccupied with national identity.
Whether revival of a classic or a brand new play, the best Irish theatre is
always in some sense an exploration of this The stronger the crisis in
identity, it would seem, the better the theatre.
The most striking aspect today is the astonishing number of playwrights at
work, from established names such as Brian Friel, Tom Murphy, John B Keane,
Hugh Leonard, Thomas Kilroy, Tom MacIntyre and Frank McGuinness, to the
younger generation: Dermot Bolger (five plays staged in three years),
Sebastian Barry, Ger FitzGibbon, Antoine O'Flatharta, Jim NMolan, Billy
Roche, Mannix Flynn and the 23 year old Michael West, whose version of
Tartuffe is running now at the Gate. Irish theatre is writer-led, in
contrast to the actor-led English theatre, where technical training is
paramount.
Indeed, given scant resources for training, it is extraordinary how
professional Irish work is, even in small provincial companies. Dublin used
to dominate Irish theatre - 'Dublin' being the Abbey (the National Theatre
of Ireland) and The Gate. The scene began to change about 15 years ago, when
Garry Hynes, now artistic director of the Abbey, founded the Druid Theatre
in Galway: a shoestring venture, the prototype of numerous other small
companies which have come (and sometimes gone) in recent years.
Phelim Donlon, drama officer of the Arts Council, has the unenviable task of
allocating drama's tiny budget of IPounds 3,338,7000 (out of a total budget
of IPounds 10,028,000, in 1992, for all the arts). He identifies the success
of these small companies as the biggest change on the drama scene. Their
names give the flavour of their often unconventional approach to drama:
Rough Magic, Co-Motion, Pigsback, Focus, Wet Paint (all Dublin-based);
Punchbag (Galway), Red Kettle (Waterford), Graffiti (Cork). Not all receive
a direct Arts Council grant - Punchbag won its Fringe First at Edinburgh
without one - but they benefit indirectly from the Arts Council's policy of
subsidising small performance spaces and providing touring grants.
There is resentment, among the newcomers, that the Abbey and The Gate
between them absorb two thirds of the drama budget. Vincent O'Shea, artistic
director of Cork's Everyman Palace, maintains that 'we cannot afford to
support the huge standing army represented by the Abbey at the expense of
the guerrillas who are saving Irish theatre from dullness and boredom.'
Phelim Donlon explains that this is because, when responsibility for the
Abbey and The Gate was transferred to the Arts Council in 1976, they brought
their own budgets with them. (In those days they absorbed some 90 per cent
of the drama budget; their directors in turn now complain of being
under-funded.)
The only significant instance of regular corporate sponsorship for theatre
is Irish Life's commitment to the Dublin Theatre Festival which takes over
the city for two weeks in early October. The festival has a dual function:
it is an opportunity to showcase the best local productions, and it also
gives Irish audiences a chance to see the work of overseas companies.
There is a tendency, in the younger generation, to react against the word -
the literary quality which has hitherto distinguished Irish theatre - and to
emphasise physical imagery rather than verbal. The Kabuki Hamlet, the
Schiller Theatre's Macbeth and the circus-inspired Archaos were big hits of
the last two festivals, and their influence can already be seen in local
productions.
The Abbey is still an important promoter of new talent. David Byrne, its New
Writing editor, receives between 600-700 unsolicited scripts a year. Many
come from overseas, and stand little chance against the competition from
Irish writers, particularly young ones. Mr Byrne can name over a dozen of
these, in their early 20s, some of whom can expect to see their play at The
Peacock, the Abbey's small stage, in the near future.
And yet he is pessimistic about the long term prospects of people involved
in theatre in Ireland making a comfortable living out of it. As in so many
other walks of life, the existence of the UK market is important.
