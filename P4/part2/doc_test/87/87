ON EDNA O'BRIEN'S 'LANTERN SLIDES'

A writer's life is filled with lies, most of them not of her own making. 
</P>
<P>
"Poor Mrs. O'Brien," says the countrywomen of rural Clare in speaking of Edna 
O'Brien's late mother. "Sure, she tried to hold her head up, but . . . (shrug) 
well, y'know, with a daughter like That Wan. Ah, the poor t'ing, didn't she 
travel all the way to London to visit That Wan and when she got there didn't 
she find there wasn't a stick of proper furniture to be found in the entire 
flat -- just pillows on the floor?" Of course, the content of That Wan's novels 
and stories lie beyond all possibility of comment. They are, literally, 
unspeakable. Far easier to pronounce authoritative condemnations on her decor. 
</P>
<P>
In Dublin, whither Edna fled her rural life, they recall her mad, shop-girl 
involvement with a prominent Anglo-Irish statesman, who, they aver, "taught her 
to be above herself, to have notions." They recall her marriage to a mild, 
reticent man ("You wouldn't know he was in the room"), who taught her to write 
("She hadn't a clue"). Note the nice balance in this analysis: He was of no 
account, yet he was wholly responsible for her later fame and fortune. From 
these years came "The Country Girls Trilogy," first novels that tore across the 
literary sky like comets whose tails we have yet to see the last of. 
</P>
<P>
In London, whither she fled her provincial Dublin life, they speak of her with 
admiration and a kind of tender pity as for one "beautiful and . . . (shrug) 
well, doomed, rather" -- a hopeless Celt who finds tragedy everywhere, 
especially in all those places where the English find reason only to titter and 
be smug. A romantic among the impervious Nigels and Beryls. And yet, the spell 
O'Brien casts does have its uses. "I always take along an Edna O'Brien to read 
on trains," confided one Beryl, "because then I'll always be picked up by the 
right sort." Quite. 
</P>
<P>
On her occasional sallies into New York, O'Brien leaves a sea of dazed admirers 
in her wake, all dazzled and bewitched by her unearthly beauty, her diabolical 
talent. Her reputation, both here and in London, almost threatens to overwhelm 
her work -- to elevate her to that High Empyrean where, with a few other living 
figures like Graham Greene, she may exist beyond criticism or reproach. 
</P>
<P>
But all these lies and half-truths cannot really disguise the permanent, 
universal value of her work. The fictional Irish village she returns to again 
and again is her village and your village. In "Oft in the Stilly Night," the 
opening story of "Lantern Slides," she tells us of a woman sacristan who goes 
mad: "Now I ask you, what would you do? Would you comfort (her), would you tell 
her that her sins were of her own imagining? . . . Would you loiter with the 
drunkards and laugh with the women gorging the white bread; would you perhaps 
visit the grave to say an Aye where Angela . . . and the errant husband lie 
close together, morsels for the maggots, or would you drive on helter-skelter, 
the radio at full-blast? Perhaps your own village is much the same, perhaps 
everywhere is, perhaps pity is a luxury and deliverance a thing of the past." 
</P>
<P>
In "A Little Holiday" in the same collection she gives us a 9-year-old 
Everychild whose first holiday adventure proves an immense disappointment. She 
had thought to escape the crabbedness of her own household by visiting a 
seaside aunt and uncle, whose domestic establishment proves to be even more 
bleak than her parents'. Hysterical and forlorn, she is returned home in 
disgrace. "Part of me wanted to volunteer to go back with them, while another 
part admitted that that would be absurd. Either way, I knew that I had lost 
some part of my parents' love and God only knows how long it would take to win 
it back -- days, weeks maybe, of slaving and washing up and shining at school. 
But even then it could come up at any time, this failure of mine, an added 
incentive for an outburst, another blind grope in which my mother and father 
were trying to tell each other how unhappy they were." 
</P>
<P>
She is a storyteller, an Irish storyteller, one of an ancient tradition of 
storytellers, people who tell the truth. In old Ireland, the words of a 
truthful poet were both sought and feared: They could kill. Her best work has 
the sound of something prehistoric -- palpable, thrilling, incantatory -- about 
it. It should be read aloud, like poetry. It is, indeed, not prose, at least 
not in any modern manner. 
</P>
<P>
Her plots are devastating, not a happy one among them, though they are 
intensely full of sensuous joys. Her scenes are both archetypal and resolutely 
naturalistic -- the claustrophobic, incestuous farmhouses of Ireland, the 
soiled beds of England, the desperate pleasures of a Mediterranean holiday. 
</P>
<P>
She writes with the sureness and conviction of a priestess or prophet, one of a 
long procession of prophetic Irishwomen -- from Briget and Ita in late 
antiquity, through Dark Eileen O'Connell (whose Sophoclean "Lament for Art 
O'Leary" is one of the world's great poems), to Lady Gregory and Mary Lavin and 
Maeve Brennan -- surely the boldest tradition of women writers in all 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
Edna O'Brien writes about love and death, the only two things that can ever 
matter to a great writer. She tells the truth. 
</P>
<P>
And no one should expect to be thanked for telling the truth.
