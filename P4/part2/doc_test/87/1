LAST WEDNESDAY - June 16 - was Bloomsday. That was the day in 1904 when
Leopold Bloom walked through Dublin in pursuit of his business and desires,
encountered Stephen Dedalus and brought him to his home where Stephen met
Bloom's wife Molly. It is the best documented single day in the whole of
fiction and it has become a red-letter day in the literary calendar;
publishers like to release their latest Joyceana on Bloomsday.
But can there really be anything of any importance left to release? It was
way back in 1968 that Richard Ellmann introduced from Faber a hitherto
unpublished fiction from the hand of the master, and he suggested that this
would be the end:
'It seems probable (Ellmann wrote) that Giacomo Joyce will be the last of
James Joyce's published writings. He wrote it over half a century ago in
Trieste, at that stage of his life when he was completing A Portrait of the
Artist as A Young Man and was beginning Ulysses. Giacomo Joyce pivots
between the two books.'
It was only 16 pages long - as was the original notebook in Joyce's
handwriting in which it was discovered - but is, even so, complete. It is a
meditation by Giacomo - an Irish teacher of English in Trieste, clearly
Joyce himself - on one of his female pupils who is Jewish and who attracts
him. It is highly autobiographical.
But it now seems that Ellmann was wrong. Research on Joyce's life and his
papers has continued unabated since then. Another Joyce scholar, Danis Rose,
has been working for the past 16 years on a critical edition of Finnegans
Wake and he is convinced that there was another transitional work of
fiction, Finn's Hotel (the name of the hotel where Nora Barnacle worked when
she first met Joyce), composed in between Ulysses and Finnegans.
This was projected as a series of stories about Ireland and the myths of
Ireland. They were begun in 1923 and abandoned in 1924, and then later
incorporated into the larger work. Rose claims to have reconstructed this
lost work and publication of it was to have been this year's great Bloomsday
event. But not for the first time in the history of the publication of
Joyce's works, the project seems to have ground suddenly to a halt and is
for the moment on hold.
Even so, this year will see in the autumn publication of a 'new' book by
Joyce, his Political, Critical and Occasional Writings from Viking. Little
of the contents will come as a surprise to dedicated Joyceans. They will
include his early book-reviews, his student paper on Drama and Life (quoted
in Stephen Hero), his youthful salute to the dying Ibsen, as well as later
pieces on Wilde, Shaw and Home Rule. Many of these fugitive writings have up
to now been difficult of access. To have them all conveniently placed in one
collected volume at an affordable price should be a boon.
Meanwhile the work of unlocking the mysteries of the existing published
texts reaches new levels of thoroughness. Joyce's love of word-play grew and
grew until it became an obsession, a madness. There are signs of it even as
early as Dubliners. One of the two sisters who have just attended the death
of their brother, a priest, in the first story is guilty of malapropism. She
recalls a plan for a nostalgic ride that never took place:
'. . . he kept on saying that before the summer was over he'd go out for a
drive one fine day just to see the old house again where we were all born
down in Irishtown and take me and Nannie with him. If we could only get one
of them new-fangled carriages that make no noise that Father O'Rourke told
him about, them with the rheumatic wheels . . .'
In their new annotated edition of Dubliners the editors not only give us a
gloss on Irishtown, the poor area of Dublin south of the Liffey, they also
explain that the new-fangled carriages were not motor-cars but horse-drawn
carriages with pneumatic tyres. These tyres were invented by an Irishman, JB
Dunlop, who was later described by Joyce in Finnegans as 'the best tyrent of
ourish times'. They add too that Joyce would have seen an advertisement for
a patent medicine containing the word 'rheumatic' underneath an early
version of his story in The Irish Homestead.
Then they give us two facsimile pages from the issue of this popular
magazine for August 13 1904 containing the beginning of 'The Sisters'. It
appears under the heading of 'Our Weekly Story'. The text of the story here
differs significantly in places from the later published version we all
know.
Such exemplary exegesis takes up a great deal of space; the editors'
footnotes become in fact sidenotes; and with the illustrations and
afterwords at the end of each story, the material the editors contribute to
the book is more copious than the stories it elucidates. Anyone who just
wants to read the stories without fuss had better do so in the standard
paperback and use this as a reference book. It is invaluable as an insight
into the young Joyce's mind and to the condition of Ireland at the turn of
the century.
A less exacting way of getting to Joyce's source-material is to look at the
photographs by Alain Le Garsmeur that illustrate James Joyce: Reflections of
Ireland. Much remains in Dublin that he would recognise. North Richmond
Street, for example, a cul de sac used by Joyce as the setting for the story
'Araby', and where at one time the Joyce family lived. We have the opening
of the story on one page, and a photograph of the street as it is now on the
facing one. But we need to turn to the Annotated volume for an explanation
of the street's name (after Charles Lennox, Fourth Duke of Richmond) and to
discover there were at this time two Joyce families living there.
Le Garsmeur is a fine photographer, whether catching a customer at Mulligans
raising glass to lips or the grim grandeur of such landmarks as the Poolbeg
lighthouse and the Martello Tower where Ulysses begins. No area of Joyce's
work has proved more contentious than the text of this book. The edition
prepared by Hans Walter Gabler published in 1984 and currently on sale in
Penguin as 'The Corrected Text' has been heavily assailed for a host of
alleged inaccuracies and was the subject of a blazing long-running row in
the literary press on both sides of the Atlantic. The assault was led by an
American academic John Kidd, who is editing the whole thing afresh.
Meanwhile yet another American scholar, Jeri Johnson, currently Senior Tutor
at Exeter College, Oxford, has reissued the 1922 text of Ulysses published
by Sylvia Beach from her bookshop in Paris, Shakespeare &amp; Co. This edition
was superseded even in Joyce's lifetime and is now extremely rare. Judged by
the text of later revisions, errors abound; but when all is said, this
remains the text from which the novel made its initial impact. It is the one
that its first reviewers - TS Eliot, Ezra Pound, Virginia Woolf, Arnold
Bennett et al actually read - and from which they made their assessments.
With Johnson's full introduction, there is no reason at all why it should
not give a new generation of readers their first experience of this great
work.
