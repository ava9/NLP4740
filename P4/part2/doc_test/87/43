KENNETH TYNAN LETTERS
edited by Kathleen Tynan
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 22, 690 pages
This collection of letters, unlike Kathleen Tynan's earlier, much admired
and affectionate biography of her late husband, displays some of Kenneth
Tynan's less charming characteristics. The correspondence also reveals
several surprising, and sometimes contradictory, judgments from one of the
most celebrated critics of British theatre.
His early letters from school were innocuous enough, offering only fan
letters and gossip to a friend. Oxford provided the first of several love
affairs; there is fun and variety in this correspondence but only his own
evidence of burgeoning talent. He both directed and played in the theatre;
'my production of Sweeney Agonistes was a terrific success.' Isis called him
'Oxford's best journalist, objectionable Kenneth Tynan.' He came down
without a degree but with several theatrical offers waiting. To Picture Post
he wrote that 'the year which I spent in Oxford was a superb parenthesis in
my life and, like all the best parentheses, they mean more than all the rest
of the sentence.' This was in 1950, when he was 23.
The following Christmas, he sailed with Elaine Dundy, later his first wife,
to New York. John Gielgud asked him to supper and Tynan described Kenneth
More (in The Deep Blue Sea) as 'our best answer to Marlon Brando.'
Arthur Miller's The Crucible, he wrote on a later visit to New York, was 'a
failure dramatically'. Yet 10 years on, in a memo to Olivier, Tynan included
it in a proposed schedule for the National Theatre. In January 1953 he was
working both for the Daily Sketch and the Evening Standard but in July he
wrote to David Astor for a job as second-string theatre critic on the
Observer. This did not stop him from taking on a job as script editor at
Ealing Studios, assuring Astor that 'a not too-tedious job in another field
would stimulate me.'
In September 1958, Wolcott Gibbs of the New Yorker died and William Shawn,
the editor, invited Tynan to take his place. Tynan left Ealing, with a long
critical letter to its director, and began work on the New Yorker.
The section entitled 'Crest of the Wave' begins with the break-up of his
first marriage, which Tynan, on the evidence of these letters, tried to keep
going. The ATV programme, We Dissent, which Tynan had built up with 26
liberal Americans citizens, went out in January 1960 and was ill-received in
US. It is hardly surprising that he reckoned he should be in England again,
where he wrote to Olivier to ask for a job. Olivier, reluctantly at first,
took him on as literary manager for the National Theatre.
'Celebrating the Sixties' is predominantly National Theatre correspondence.
Controversial plays included Robert Graves's re-written Much Ado and Charles
Wood's Dingo, which were turned down by the board. He continued his
freelance work, and the seduction of Kathleen (largely by telegram). In 1956
he proposed an erotic show, 'Nothing that is merely funny or merely
beautiful should be admitted; it must also be sexy.' This became the
notorious Oh] Calcutta.
The 1970s marked the start of Tynan's fade-out period. He was becoming
increasingly radical; work was commissioned from Havel and there was an idea
for pieces about Wilhelm Reich and Daniel Cohn-Bendit.
In a series of letters from Tunisia, his marriage to Kathleen was going well
but his health was breaking down. In London, Peter Hall had taken over from
Olivier at the National and there was talk of Tynan's departure.
By the spring of 1977, he and Kathleen were in California, where he went on
writing pieces about literary and dramatic figures while retaining his
English friendships. He made friends again with his first wife and with
fellow-critic Harold Hobson, and wrote rhymed birthday-cards to his
children. Then he died.
It is hard to sense much affection in these letters - but the answers to
some of his more provocative correspondence would have made interesting
reading.

AS MUCH AS I DARE
by Arnold Wesker
Century Pounds 18.99, 578 pages
If Tynan was the great chronicler of modern British drama, John Osborne, who
reshaped it in the 1950s, was its scalding prophet and Arnold Wesker was a
quieter, questioning counterpart. While Pinter and Becket wowed a complacent
theatre with their oblique absurdism, Osborne and Wesker employed their
supposed working-class realism to equally devastating effect: Osborne raged
and loathed, Wesker argued, doubted and loved.
Unlike Pinter and Beckett, their seminal early plays (Osborne's Look Back in
Anger, Wesker's Chips With Everything and his Trilogy) have dated badly, a
fact both refuse to acknowledge. While Osborne ossifies into damn-you-all
curmudgeonliness, Wesker writes, writes, writes, appealing for justice and
the recognition he gets abroad and feels he deserves at home.
This Arnold Wesker - the wounded, misunderstood artist - cries out
sporadically from the pages of an unruly, unbalanced first volume of
autobiography. He appears in paragraphs announced as 'Asides' in a narrative
that hopscotches back and forth through his life up to 1959 and beyond.
There is also the bereft husband confessing, if not regretting, the adultery
that wrecked his 35-year marriage to the adored Dusty, a marriage barely
begun as this book ends. Most embarrassingly, there is the penitent father,
appealing directly for forgiveness to the eldest son Lindsay Joe who will
not speak to him because of this betrayal. (The publisher notes that, since
writing, Wesker and son are reconciled. Whoopee.)
Mostly though, this is a chronicle of the early years that preceded Wesker's
early success, where he's at pains to assert what most writers spend their
lives denying - the direct autobiographical nature of his plays, poems and
prose. The last hundred-odd pages are gripping as the twentysomething Wesker
is tentatively fostered by the Royal Court, lunched by impresarios and
championed by his revolutionary peers after years of rejection letters. To
reach this consummately readable apotheosis, though, you have to hack
through over 400 pages of reminiscence, romanticism and (Wesker denies it,
but it is there) nostalgia.
The story of his childhood and early adulthood is clotted with diary
extracts (his own and others), letters (ditto), and illustrative snatches
from his works. Wesker could condense, paraphrase or edit, but refuses to.
He depicts himself through younger writings as a mildly embarrassing but
adorable innocent.
His hopes, dreams and, above all, his family and friends are laid
painstakingly and repeatedly before us in an often gauche, sometimes
unctuous and always rambling narrative. Wesker's family - cantankerous but
loving mother, ineffectual father, saintly sister - appear with a frequency
justified by his reliance on them for the grist of his drama. His friends
are another matter. Although many metamorphosed into characters in his
plays, many more seem to be evoked for the sake of avenging past slights or
expunging past guilts in print. A huge number are incidental to the
narrative, suggesting that Wesker is more interested in communing with his
past than communicating with the reader.
Wesker bemoans his infelicity with prose, and it shows. His style at first
is either overwrought and overexcited or fetishistically introspective and
self-absorbed. As if to illustrate the blend of self-doubt and
self-justification that makes up the large part of this volume (the title is
very apt), the pages are littered with question and exclamation marks.
When writing about his early years, Wesker is like a child, alternately
demanding acknowledgment of his cleverness or wheedling for sympathy. Later
 -much later - he settles down to become fast, funny, even fair. He is
brilliantly even-handed to his late friend, the dictatorial director John
Dexter, who premiered Chicken Soup With Barley, Roots and The Kitchen. There
are also thumbnail sketches to rival Osborne's depictions of Tony Richardson
and George Devine, the powerful Royal Court supremos.
For the most part, though, as in his early plays, Wesker now seems to be
overdoing it. His Russian-Transylvanian ancestry; the milieu of an East End
Jewish family through the 1930s, '40s and '50s; the factors that shaped a
young, working-class, autodidact Jewish playwright are all somewhat
smothered by the tangential, the incidental and the inconsequential.
Since this book officially ends in 1959 (Wesker constantly runs ahead of
himself), I presume there's at least one more volume to come. The last fifth
of As Much As l Dare hints at how good the next book might be. The other
four-fifths do not.
