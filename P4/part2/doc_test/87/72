MARY RENAULT: A BIOGRAPHY by David Sweetman Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 18, 322
pages
MARY RENAULT - real name Molly Challans - was an English, Oxford-educated,
professional nurse, lesbian, mildly reclusive, who lived in South Africa
from 1948 until her death in 1983 and who wrote a sequence of the most
remarkable and successful historical novels of this century.
As this workmanlike and readable biography shows, she made a difficult
transition from her half-dozen 'contemporary' novels, usually setting
bisexual themes against a hospital background and climaxing in The
Charioteer (surely it cannot be 'the best British novel to come out of World
War Two') to eight novels which are extraordinary in the depth and detail of
their evocation of daily life in ancient Greece - The Last of the Wine, The
King Must Die, The Bull from the Sea, The Persian Boy, etc.
The most surprising thing about this is that she scarcely knew Greece: she
went there on holiday only twice - in 1954 (including a single day in
Crete]) and in 1962 - and appears to have had no particular affection for
its modern manifestation. She was no classicist but she did not shirk her
scholarly research, which evidently was as indispensable to her fictions as
her imaginative genius.
The child of a sad marriage, she had studied at Oxford in the years when
Gilbert Murray was giving his famous lectures and the Ashmolean was
benefiting from the discoveries at Knossos of its former curator, Sir Arthur
Evans. She drifted for years, signed up as a nurse at the Radcliffe, met her
lifelong partner, Julie Mullard, wrote her first novels, worked through the
war, and moved to South Africa (to the suburbs first of Durban and then of
Cape Town), where she was active in the Progressive politics of her adopted
country.
David Sweetman argues that she was consciously aware of a parallel between
the moral decisions offered to private citizens in fifth century Athens and
1950s South Africa, but that hardly seems central to her creative
achievement, where her identification with ancient Greece has something
uncanny and unforgettable to it. She discovered Jung fairly late - 'a most
exhilarating peak-in-Darien feeling' she commented, and added, with true
wit, that the travails of Theseus in The King Must Die should have been
called The Mother Strikes Back.
If this biography has a thesis, it is overstated: that she was 'a key figure
in the sexual revolution of the twentieth century'. True, her portrayal of
homosexuals as central characters in her novels probably helped to change
public and middle-brow attitudes, and she had a cult gay readership,
especially in the US. 'The Last of the Wine was a rite of passage, The
Persian Boy a gift for young male lovers. Gay bookshops in San Francisco had
prominent 'Renault' sections', Sweetman notes. Her books became part of the
curriculum of the new university discipline of Gay Literature. But she was
much more than that: I suspect that her novels will survive, and not just in
the bookshops of California and the tourist kiosks of Crete.
The King Must Die has just been re-issued by Sceptre (Pounds 5.99)
