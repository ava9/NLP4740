WEXFORD will be associated by many with the annual opera festival, where the
conviviality is every bit as memorable as the music. Last weekend an equally
friendly but far more informal festival surrounded the Irish premiere of
Billy Roche's Wexford Trilogy on the stage of the Theatre Royal before a
mainly local audience.
Off season the Wexford welcome is as warm as ever, but there is no
disguising the fact that the rambling Victorian seaport has problems. The
young wander the streets at dusk, ghetto blasters blaring heavy metal, while
a muted carillon rings out the Angelus. 'Bet Here]' says a hand-painted
sign, while round the corner a chipped metal fingerpost reads 'Snooker'.
I ended up down at The Undertaker's - a bar owned by Eddie Macken's cousin.
I was not only in Wexford to see Billy Roche's plays, I was living them out.
It was eery.
When it was known that the trilogy was on its way to the Abbey in Dublin,
Jerome Hynes, Artistic Director of Wexford's Theatre Royal, saw the
potential for a 'community-based festival' celebrating Billy Roche's
achievement. Wexford Corporation and the Arts Council immediately came up
with the necessary subsidy. Hynes will not give any figures, but with
tickets at Pounds 6 each and only one performance of each play it was
presumably a significant amount. The Abbey co-operated with transport. A
book launch, a seminar, a civic reception and a brunch were added to the
programme and the result was The Billy Roche Weekend.
The irony of Wexford mounting a festival to celebrate work which shows the
town in an unflattering light was initially puzzling. The plays were
commissioned by the Bush Theatre, and gained six awards on the London Fringe
between 1989 and 1992. These productions come from the Bush with an
excellent cast of mainly London-based Irish actors. They are playing in
Dublin at the Abbey Theatre's small stage, The Peacock, until February 13.
The whole enterprise is representative of the close relationship between
London theatre and Irish theatre, with Dublin productions transferring to
London, and new plays by Irish playwrights being acclaimed in London before
being seen at home.
On Friday the cast had not quite conquered the challenge of playing to a
packed 550-seater as opposed to the 90-seater Bush, but there was no
mistaking the warmth of the play's reception. Roche reported that Wexford
audiences laughed in different places from London audiences; this is not
surprising - the repartee is razor-sharp, and the idiolect is pure Wexford.
When asked what he found so special about Wexford, Roche replied quite
simply, 'The way they speak to one another', and as far as his work is
concerned he is right.
It was good to see someone being so honoured in his lifetime, but it was
also rather bizarre. The event ran the risk of going over the top, and only
Roche's modesty and good humour saved it. Good as the trilogy is, at 43 he
is only at the start of his career.
In a toe-curling speech at the Civic Reception the County Manager linked the
trilogy to job creation and tourist development. Those who saw the plays
could have no doubts that they were not written to bolster the self-esteem
of the local community; they are as much about the need to leave the place,
and the sense of failure and entrapment that small town life can produce.
Roche's relationship with his home town is a typical love-hate one. 'I wrote
in spite of the town, not because of it,' he said, remembering that he got
no encouragement when he left home to become an actor - 'My father thought
I'd be making my own dresses next.'
