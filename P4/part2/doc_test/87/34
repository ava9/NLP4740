THE LETTERS OF BRENDAN BEHAN edited by EH Mikhail Macmillan Pounds 45, 224
pages
BRENDAN Behan once remarked that, when his biography came to be written,
they would have trouble making out anything from his letters because he
hadn't written any. Well, he bargained without EH Mikhail. Every time Behan
set pen to paper, he unwittingly added to the scope of The Letters of
Brendan Behan.
When, as an IRA man back in 1942, he sent a package of detonators and a
Webley revolver to a friend, his accompanying note ('Please give bearer my
equipment') was fodder for this wonderfully exhaustive work. When he signed
an agreement with one Gerald C. Raffles giving him the 'sole and full
rights' to his most famous play, The Quare Fellow, the letter (including the
three halfpenny stamps) finished up in this volume.
Mikhail's intention that his book should 'restore the reality of the artist
and the man' is unlikely to be advanced much by his inclusion of Behan's
one-line note (in Irish) on the outside of a brown paper package to a pub
owner, saying: 'To Arthur, with the love of my heart.' Behan, who often had
to pawn his typewriter to get the price of a drink, would have been
prostrated by the thought that his idlest scribble would have ended up in a
book costing no less than Pounds 45.
Still, this volume will be a gift for those like myself to whom anything by
the author of Borstal Boy - the most remarkable of autobiographies - and The
Quare Fellow is a pure pleasure. But I cannot say honestly that it will do
much to explode 'the myth of the boisterous performer,' because Behan is a
performer as a letter writer just as much as he is anywhere else.
Many of the letters are included already in Ulick O'Connor's admirable
biography of Behan. The correspondence with Iain Hamilton is amusing. He was
the publisher who commissioned Behan's first book, and whom he bombarded
with excuses for late writing, requests for money, suggestions for textual
alterations, and sundry thoughts such as his reflection that sexual
frustration might have been what drove him and his IRA friends to political
violence. 'Maybe it would be a good thing for the peace of the world if sex
(boy and girl stuff, I mean) was compulsory,' he mused.
There is not much in the book to illumine Behan's relationship with his
long-suffering wife, Beatrice, except for a charming little poem apologising
for lapsing from his promise to her to foresake all other drink but stout,
which ends with the lines: 'Why does any woman/ give herself the trouble
that/ husbands are when with less trouble/ she could buy and train a cat?'
Most, if not all, Behan's letters to the newspapers are printed here. Some
are more essays than letters, such as his letter to the New Yorker which was
published at the time his play, The Hostage, opened in New York and which
summarises Behan's perception of himself as a playwright: 'You see, in The
Hostage I have nothing to sell, not religion, not a political system, not a
philosophy, and certainly not a panacea for the ills of the world. I respect
kindness to human beings first of all, and kindness to animals. I don't
respect the law; l have a total irreverence for anything concerned with
society except that which makes the roads safer, the beer stronger, the food
cheaper, and old men and women warmer in the winter and happier in the
summer.
One feud that he carried on through the letters pages of newspapers was that
with Patrick Kavanagh, the northern Irish poet, who detested Behan (it was
mutual). He also wrote to them to defend the Dublin working classes from the
charge of fecklessness and the IRA from that of sectarianism. Behan might
have left his past as a republican and house-painter behind with his success
as a playwright, but he wasn't having anyone think that he had abandoned his
identity.
Interestingly, his early letters from prison show that he was perfectly
confident in his ability to capture the diction of the Dublin working
classes in his first stab at a play: 'I do claim to have taken nine real
Dublin slummies and stuck them on paper. I even go so far as to claim that
they are as genuine as any of O'Casey's battalion - maybe more so because
O'Casey was a Protestant and that means a big lot.'
Because Behan's great charm was to represent a very fluent Dublin
proletariat, anything he writes is bound to give pleasure, receipts and all.
But the wit of an Irish republican and alcoholic cannot really be captured
by a heavy-handed Canadian academic. Anyone who wants the essence of Behan
should save the Pounds 45 and clamour for his collected journalistic pieces,
Hold Your Hour and Have Another, to be returned to print.
