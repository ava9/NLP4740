  [Text] Ties between India and Uzbekistan, which date back 
to ancient years, [break in reception lasting several seconds] 
the visit of the Uzbek president, Mr. Islam A. Karimov. The 
visit, resulting in a series of agreements and memorandum of 
understanding between both the countries, besides high-level 
deliberations, is bound to take their bilateral relations to new 
heights in the new year. The Uzbekistan, the land of the 
builders of India's historic Taj Mahal, offers a very lucrative 
mosaic of opportunities to Indian entrepreneurs, businessmen, 
and industrialists. It is time for Indian businessmen to give 
up inhibitions and invest in this former Soviet republic known 
for gas deposits, coal reserves, non-ferrous metals and gold. 
Now pursuing the path of a free market economy, Uzbekistan is 
witnessing considerable foreign investment flow. The changed 
global scenario definitely demands Indian businessmen to break 
the barrier and tap the available opportunities in the land 
where people also love Indian films and adore Raj Kapoor, the 
doyen of Indian cinema. 
  As Mr. Karimov put it after his arrival in New Delhi on 
Monday, he would not like Indian businessmen to be left behind. 
Besides strengthening cooperation in economic areas, the two 
countries can launch a joint offensive against fundamentalism 
and extremism with India playing a greater role in Central Asian 
region in political fields as well. During his meeting with the 
Indian president, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, the Uzbek president 
said that the disintegration of the Soviet Union had created a 
vacuum in Central Asian region. India has a special 
relationship with the countries of the region when Europeans and 
other countries are to get a foothold. [sentence as heard] The 
agreements and memorandums of understanding now being entered 
between the two countries involve cooperation in economic and 
other areas, including telecommunications, science and 
technology, culture, and transport and transit. The Uzbek 
president earlier held formal talks with the Indian prime 
minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, and discussed bilateral issues 
with several Indian ministers. India had recently extended a 
credit of $10 million for setting up projects with Indian 
know-how and entrepreneurial participation in Uzbekistan. 
Projects worth $7.8 billion [as heard] for Uzbekistan have also 
been approved in addition. Uzbek personnel are being trained in 
India in disciplines such as diplomacy, banking, management and 
mass communication. In the area of joint ventures, the two 
countries are also producing electronic and brass wares. 
India's (Thapar Group) is also to set up a cotton yarn plant in 
Uzbekistan. 
  Close interaction between the top leaders of both the 
countries has been on ever since the Central Asian Republics 
attained independence two years ago. While New Delhi was the 
first city that Uzbek president, Mr. Karimov, visited outside 
the Commonwealth of Independent States in 1991 after his country 
decided to break away from the former USSR, Indian Prime 
Minister Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao reciprocated the gesture in May 
last year when he chose Uzbekistan as his first destination 
within the CIS as prime minister. Only last year, five 
agreements on cooperation in science and technology, tourism, 
avoidance of double taxation and cooperation between the foreign 
offices of the two countries were signed during the visit of the 
Uzbek deputy prime minister, Mr. (T.M. Miryakubov). Mr. 
Karimov, accompanied by a delegation from Uzbekistan, including 
the foreign minister and chairman of board of dealing with trade 
like industry, economic relations, civil aviation and tourism 
met leading Indian industrialists and entrepreneurs to explore 
possible areas of cooperation. This visit is likely to open a 
new era in India-Uzbekistan links with this Central Asian 
country creating conditions for mutually beneficial cooperation 
and encouraging ties with foreign companies, firms and financial 
institutions.
