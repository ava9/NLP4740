The Taj Mahal city of Agra has become a virtual ghost town after at least 11 
people were killed there in the Hindu-Muslim violence gripping India. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people have died across the nation since Dec. 7 in violence 
sparked by a dispute over a shrine in Ayodhya in the northern state of Uttar 
Pradesh. Officials describe the violence as among the worst since India gained 
independence 43 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In Agra, also in Uttar Pradesh, police spokesman M. P. Solanki said Monday that 
at least 11 people have been killed and 28 injured in Hindu-Muslim clashes 
since Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers, paramilitary units and police patrolled the streets and stood guard 
around the Taj Mahal, closed since the fighting broke out. The soldiers turned 
back two Australian tourists who tried to enter the grounds of the sparkling 
marble masterpiece of 17th-Century Muslim architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The huge wooden gates were shut, and an official said it was too dangerous to 
allow anyone inside the Taj Mahal, built by the Muslim ruler Shah Jehan in 
memory of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
The official appeared to be referring to fears that Hindu extremists might make 
a target of the Taj Mahal, one of the few popular destinations left for 
tourists visiting India. 
</P>
<P>
An indefinite curfew and heavy security kept most people off Agra's streets, 
and nearly every shop was boarded up. 
</P>
<P>
The Hindu militants are campaigning to claim the Ayodhya site as the birthplace 
of the Hindu god-king Lord Rama. They say Muslim invaders razed a temple on 
Lord Rama's birthplace in 1528 to build a monument to the Islamic conquest of 
India. 
</P>
<P>
In New Delhi, Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar said that he is prepared to use 
"any amount of force needed" if dialogue fails to halt the Hindu-Muslim riots. 
</P>
<P>
"Certain people are trying to create trouble. They are exploiting this thing," 
he said in an interview with Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
The sectarian violence helped bring down his predecessor, Prime Minister V. P. 
Singh, about a month ago. Parliament then gave Shekhar a vote of confidence to 
form a new government. 
</P>
<P>
He said Monday that he is optimistic that dialogue can defuse the sectarian 
rivalries and fears that have spurred Hindus and Muslims to murderous riots in 
several cities. Mobs have slaughtered infants with axes, burned people alive 
and lynched passengers on passing trains. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to grapple with the situation," Shekhar said, adding: "We 
want to deal with the situation with restraint and patience." 
</P>
<P>
Shekhar, a veteran politician, tends to speak in political platitudes in 
public. But he has a reputation for tough-minded effectiveness when it comes to 
wheeling and dealing in private with his friends and foes. 
</P>
<P>
Shekhar said his willingness to make political deals and engage in dialogue 
should not be interpreted as a sign of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, he said he soon will present a new peace plan for Punjab, where Sikh 
extremists have killed more than 3,100 people this year, the highest annual 
toll since they launched their separatist campaign in 1982.
