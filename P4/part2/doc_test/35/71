Seven people died and 50 were reported missing because a low-caste 15-year-old 
bridegroom from India's Taj Mahal town of Agra wanted to ride to his wedding on 
horseback, a local member of Parliament said today. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Agra, 125 miles south of Delhi, said they had arrested 200 people and 
were keeping four ghettos for Harijans -- the untouchables at the bottom of the 
Hindu caste hierarchy -- under curfew after the wedding sparked a caste war. 
</P>
<P>
Bridegroom Ram Deen, a Harijan, eventually rode to nearby Panwari village in a 
police jeep to marry 13-year-old Mundra while the army fought back thousands of 
enraged Jats, the caste of small landowners, in the village and police 
confronted thousands of Agra Harijans just outside.
