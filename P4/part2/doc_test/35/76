THE BEST place to get away from the cocooned world of corporate travel and
the 24-hour rush hour that is India is the golf course.
There are more than 160 courses in India, ranging from marvellous city
courses like Bombay Presidency and Royal Calcutta to services courses and
hill stations such as Ooty, for which the word 'undulating' is an extreme
understatement. In Gulmarg, in Kashmir, India has the highest golf course in
the world (2,700 metres).
In my experience Indian golf courses are the cheapest, least busy and by the
far the friendliest in the world. On average a round will cost Pounds 1, a
caddie 40p for 18 holes, an uggawallah, or ballspotter, 20p, and
water-bearer 15p. You don't even have to take your clubs. A set of Pings can
be hired for 30p a round. Equipment is cheap to buy, too. A pair of shoes
costs Pounds 6 in a pro's shop.
There is always someone in the clubhouse afterwards eager to introduce you
to Officer's Choice beer, Indian rum or the club's famed chickpea curry.
Letters of introduction are not needed. All imperialists are welcome.
Indians want the world to know about their golf courses, and the world
deserves to know.
Golf was played in India 55 years before any major course established itself
in continental Europe or the US. Founded in 1829, and formerly called the
Dum Dum club , Calcutta is the oldest golf club in the world outside
Britain. It is India's only par-73 course and, at 7,100 yards, its longest
and most difficult. It is just down the road from the Oberoi Hotel where you
can spoil yourself with excellent service and cuisine.
Like Calcutta, the Tea Lawn behind the 18th green at Delhi Golf Club is out
of bounds. And it has other idiosyncratic hazards. The 3,000 peacocks that
live on the course, and the tombs of the favourite concubines of Lodhi
rulers, are deemed to be integral features of the course and immovable
obstructions.
Only one British company specialises in golf holidays to India. Dorset-based
Indian Encounters offers 12-17-day golf safaris taking in Delhi, Calcutta,
Bombay and Bangalore. The Taj Mahal and Goa are also on the itinerary. Agra
has a nine-hole course. Golf is well organised in India and the courses are
good. January and February are the best months to play. You have to cope
with the occasional suspicious rustle from the rough, and holes called The
Elephant Pit and Hydrophobia, but is a great way to see the country.
Most of the bigger city clubs have their own inexpensive and comfortable
accommodation. Bombay Presidency isn't far from the Searock Sheraton. The
Windsor Manor at Bangalore overlooks the course and is only a 10p rickshaw
ride away.
