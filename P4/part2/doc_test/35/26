State gaming regulators announced a routine audit of Donald Trump's financial 
empire at the same time that Trump's newest gambling hall disclosed plans to 
have an independent auditor examine the bills of contractors angry about not 
getting paid. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey Gaming Enforcement Director Anthony Parrillo said that such a review 
by his agency is normal and that it hasn't looked at Trump's operations for a 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't to sound or signal that there are problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 contractors involved in the $1-billion Taj Mahal Casino Resort have 
gone to the state Casino Control Commission in search of a means to force 
payment from Trump. Trump officials announced the audit Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The group contends that it is owed about $35 million. The contractors are angry 
because they pushed to meet the casino's April 2 opening date based on promises 
that they would be paid in full.
