  [Abstract] Only 7-10% of the DNA in the human genome 
represents structural genes, regulatory sequences, origins of 
replication, sequences bound to the nuclear matrix and 
P-repeats. A theory is proposed that this DNA be regarded as 
basic genome of the eukaryotic cells. The reason for the excess 
DNA present in the eukaryotic genome remains enigmatic, but one 
answer may be that it provides a critical chromatin mass 
necessary to maintain the structural organization and 
macromolecular framework for successful mitosis or meiosis. 
Studies on the human genome could be considerable facilitated 
and reduced in cost if such efforts were to be solely directed 
at the basic genome, excluding the non-basic genome from the 
sequencing efforts. References 14: 4 Russian, 10 Western.
