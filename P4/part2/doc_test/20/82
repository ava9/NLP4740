Committee. Where appropriate, Appendix K, Physical Containment for Large Scale Uses of Organisms Containing Recombinant
DNA Molecules, shall be used.

Certain experiments involving the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one
or more human subjects that are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by Sections III&hyph;A&hyph;2, III&hyph;B&hyph;2, III&hyph;B&hyph;3, and that are not considered exempt
under Section V&hyph;U must be registered with NIH/ORDA. The relevant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional Review Board must review and approve all experiments in this
category prior to their initiation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Experiments not included in Sections III&hyph;A, III&hyph;B, III&hyph;C, III&hyph;E, and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsections are considered in Section III&hyph;D. All such experiments may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted at BL1 containment. For experiments in this category, a registration document (see Section III&hyph;C)
shall be dated and signed by the investigator and filed with the local Institutional Biosafety Committee at the time
the experiment is initiated. The Institutional Biosafety Committee reviews and approves all such proposals, but
Institutional Biosafety Committee review and approval prior to initiation of the experiment is not required (see
Section IV&hyph;A). For example, experiments in which all components derived from non-pathogenic prokaryotes
and non-pathogenic lower eukaryotes fall under Section III&hyph;D and may be conducted at BL1 containment.

Recombinant DNA molecules containing no more than two-thirds of the genome 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of any eukaryotic virus (all viruses from a single Family (see Section V&hyph;Q) being considered identical (see
Section V&hyph;S)) may be propagated and maintained in cells in tissue culture using BL1 containment. For such experiments,
it must be demonstrated that the cells lack helper virus for the specific Families of defective viruses being used.
If helper virus is present, procedures specified under Section III&hyph;C&hyph;3 should be used. The DNA may contain
fragments of the genome of viruses from more than one Family but each fragment shall be less than two-thirds of a genome.
