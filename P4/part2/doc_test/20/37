  [Abstract] Cell hybrids containing human chromosomes or 
their fragments against the ``background'' of the hamster or 
mouse genome are among the most popular tools for analyzing the 
human genome. Until now, attempts to create and maintain such 
hybrids have been fraught with a number of problems. A 
fundamentally new technique for detecting human DNA based on a 
polymerase chain reaction [PCR] with arbitrary primers (referred 
to as the AP-PCR method) has been developed. The new method was 
tested on two previously created hybrid clones representing a 
cross of Chinese hamster (VL79-_g_-8) and the human cell line 
HeLa. The yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae 15V 
P4 was used as a negative control. Genome DNA that yielded 
well-differentiated PCR patterns when amplified with two 
different arbitrary primers (21 and 45) was isolated from the 
hybrid clones and from the pure cell lines. From the standpoint 
of the appearance of their PCR patterns, the two hybrid clones 
produced with the two different primers were in no way different 
from the starting hamster line. Dot hybridization of the 
amplified DNA of these clones with tagged human amplified DNA 
clearly demonstrated the presence of human DNA, however. The DNA 
of the yeasts amplified with primer 45 yielded the same negative 
result as the hamster DNA. In the human genome DNA (HeLa), 
researchers succeeded in amplifying those unique, strictly 
specific genome sequences that, when used as a tagged probe, 
revealed homologous human DNA in the DNA cell hybrids and thus 
confirmed their hybrid nature. Dot hybridization with the 
amplified hamster DNA used as a probe demonstrated that 
hamster-specific sequences are completely absent in the human 
DNA amplified with the same primer. Similar results were 
obtained for primers 21 and 45. The new AP-PCR, which is said to 
be without analogues, was deemed suitable not only for detecting 
human DNA in interspecific hybrids but also in identifying human 
chromosomes by in situ hybridization or cross dot hybridization 
with monochromosomal human hybrids. The new AP-PCR method was 
said to possess the following distinctive features: 

  -  the selection of primers is unlimited (no knowledge of 
nucleotide sequence is required when constructing primers, and 
paired combinations of primers may be used to make sequencing 
easier; 
  -  one and the same primer may be used to identify the DNA of 
both 
organisms whose genomes constitute a given cell hybrid; 
  -  the result of amplification is always positive (the 
amplifiability of DNA is directly controlled) 
  -  the presence of DNA is judged not by the fact of 
amplification 
but rather by the capability of the amplified DNA under analysis 
to hybridize with human DNA amplified with the very same 
primer.
