FT  01 JUL 93 / Technology: A market that could spiral - The commercial
opportunities for gene therapy are growing by the minute

Bolstered by government approval for a number of clinical trials in the US,
gene therapy - the process of re-encoding the DNA in cells - is on the verge
of commercialisation.
Once confined to scientists' laboratories, gene therapy is now a defined and
growing industry. New companies in the sector are springing up all over the
US and a number have obtained approval from the federal Food and Drug
Administration to conduct clinical trials on treatments for diseases ranging
from cystic fibrosis to brain cancer.
One of the first human trials approved for gene therapy, a treatment for ADA
(or 'bubble baby' disease), which causes children to be born without an
immune system, was launched three years ago, and has shown promising
results. If clinical trials on other diseases go as well, companies in the
sector say they may be marketing products as early as 1997.
'The concept of using genes as drugs is revolutionary and will greatly
expand possibilities for treating various diseases,' says Ronald Crystal, a
professor at Cornell University medical school and an authority on gene
therapy. 'The commercial opportunities are very exciting.'
Gene therapy is a spin-off from biotechnology. But whereas biotechnology
makes use of synthetic proteins as drugs, gene therapy aims to change the
DNA structure of cells so that they will produce therapeutic proteins in the
body. Originally seen as a way of addressing congenital gene deficiencies,
such as those that lead to cystic fibrosis and haemophilia, gene therapy is
now being considered for possible use in the fight against cancer, Aids and
cardiovascular diseases.
The expanded focus not only makes the approach more promising from a medical
standpoint; it also increases the commercial potential of gene therapy
products.
'The market size for gene therapy will be defined by the disease targets,'
says Marc Schneebaum, chief financial officer of Genetic Therapy, a leading
gene therapy group. 'There are only a 100 or so patients in the US with ADA
disease. But there are 30,000 with cystic fibrosis and millions of Americans
contract cancer every year.'
As the link between specific genes and diseases becomes more evident, the
possible applications for gene therapy broaden.
'More genes are being discovered to be the cause of certain diseases, which
means that gene therapy may be used to treat a wide range of illnesses,'
explains Alain Schreiber, president of the gene therapy group Vical. For
instance, non-small-cell lung cancer - the most common form of lung cancer -
has now been associated with the inactivity of a gene that normally
suppresses tumour growth.
To get the recombinant DNA sequences into the target cells, researchers rely
on carriers such as crippled retroviruses. These inactive viruses invade the
cells and alter their DNA structure. The use of these viruses, though, has
caused some concern about possible side effects. 'Retroviruses are known to
undergo a recombination if a helper virus is around,' says Schreiber. 'They
are always risky.'
As a result, some researchers have switched to adeno viruses - the class of
viruses that causes common diseases such as colds - as a safer bet. 'The
problem with these is that they are very promiscuous,' says Schreiber. 'They
are difficult to control.'
Vical has turned to liposomes - tiny globules of fat - as an even safer,
though less effective, means of gene transfer. In the UK, too, researchers
are tending to favour liposomes rather than viruses. 'The impact may not be
as long-lasting, but that may be desirable. If a therapy is temporary, it's
much easier to control in case something goes wrong,' says Schreiber.
Despite its promise, gene therapy faces a number of hurdles on the way to
the medical marketplace. The most pressing problem is how to get the
treatment into the patient.
Because of the risks involved, most gene therapy trials continue to rely on
an ex vivo approach, by which cells are removed from the patient's body,
treated, then reintroduced after a period of monitoring.
One company - Genetic Therapy - has moved to in vivo trials for its brain
cancer treatment, treating cells in the body of the patient. The company
asserts that the process is safe, since the carrier virus attacks only
rapidly proliferating tumour cells. However, a great deal of concern lingers
over in vivo treatments.
'In vivo gene therapy is much riskier than ex vivo,' says David Carter,
president of the group Somatix Therapy. 'Outside the body, you can monitor
the effects of the treatment. Inside you can't. What if the virus invades
the wrong cells? If it does, it could cause genetic modification.'
Some observers argue that because gene therapy is being used to treat a
number of fatal diseases, the risks are relative. 'When you're talking about
a brain cancer patient who has maybe nine months to live, the risks seem
less important,' says Schneebaum.
'Radiation and chemotherapy, the methods commonly used now, are known to
have serious side-effects. Our brain cancer treatment, although it may have
risks, has not yet been shown to have any side effects at all.'
Ex vivo therapy may be safer, but because it is far more difficult to
administer, its commercial potential is limited. 'Clearly, ex vivo treatment
is pretty cumbersome for any mass drug, since it can't be bought in a drug
store, or even obtained at a doctor's office,' says Alan Smith, head of the
genetic therapy programme at the biotechnology group Genzyme. 'Eventually,
the form of treatment for gene therapy will have to change if it is going to
be widely available.'
Another problem for the sector is obtaining intellectual property rights.
The FDA has sent mixed signals on the viability of patenting gene therapy
products. Although the industry has applied for a number of patents, few
have been issued. 'There are controversies about the patenting of gene
segments, and clearly this is a major concern for the sector,' says
Schneebaum.
Financing is another hurdle. When biotechnology got under way in the 1970s
and 1980s, Wall Street and venture capital groups were only too willing to
finance start-ups. Gene therapy also appeared attractive to investors about
18 months ago. The venture capital market has now almost dried up, though,
and the uncertainty surrounding the Clinton administration's health reform
programme is making it difficult for all pharmaceutical groups to raise
capital.
Like biotechnology groups in their early years, some gene therapy groups
have turned to licensing agreements with larger pharmaceutical groups to
obtain financing for research and development. Still, licensing may not be a
solution for everyone. 'We want to obtain financing, but we don't want to
give away the store,' says Stewart Parker, president of the gene therapy
group Targeted Genetics.
Many observers see a number of parallels between the position of gene
therapy today and the position of biotechnology groups 10 years ago. 'A lot
of gene therapy groups are where the Amgens and Genetechs were in 1983,'
says Fernando Quezada, executive director of the Biotechnology Centre of
Excellence in Boston.
Despite the scientific and business similarities between the two fields,
there is strangely little cross-over. Biotechnology groups Biogen and Chiron
say they are looking into gene therapy but the only group with any actual
commitment to the new field is Genzyme.
'It may be that most biotechnology groups, which are facing a number of
risks already, see gene therapy as an added uncertainty,' says Smith. 'We
see it as an exciting opportunity.'
As in the biotechnology industry, the road to commercialisation will
probably be riddled with potholes, but as the gene therapy industry matures,
more believers are betting that the new approach will not only offer
important medical advances but generate profits as well.
