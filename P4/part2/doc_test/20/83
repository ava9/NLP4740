  [Abstract] The urgency of the cholera problem which was 
heightened even further during the seventh pandemic outbreak 
which affected Stavropol kray and Rostov and Odessa oblasts in 
1990-91 and the attendant spread and long-term circulation of 
Vibrio cholerae in surface reservoirs prompted a 
renewed search for cholera strain identification methods. The 
difficulty of species identification with the help of available 
DNA probes because the vct genes are present in the genomes of 
far from all Vibrio cholerae strains and have a high 
homology with the Escherichia coli toxin genes 
necessitated the development of a species-specific probe and 
formulation of a new V. cholerae identification 
method on the basis of DNA molecular hybridization. The findings 
demonstrate that not only the intact 1.74 kD HindIII fragments 
but their component segments are absolutely specific and have a 
sensitivity of 10[.sup]6[/] microbial cells or 60 æg of 
purified total chromosomal DNA. The development of the 
species-specific probe makes it possible reliably and quickly to 
identify a large number of freshly separated V. 
cholerae strains and determine their epidemic hazard. This 
approach precludes an incorrect diagnosis for infections caused 
by pathogenic E. coli strains containing elt genes in 
their genome. Figures 1; tables 1; references 28: 13 Russian, 15
