Research"] 
  [Text] Bonn. Within the coming five years the Federal 
Ministry of Research will provide about DM100 million for 
speeding up utilization of the results of gene research. Paul 
Krueger, Federal Minister of Research, announces that the 
emphasis in the new research program, "Methods of Decoding and 
Utilizing Biological Building Charts," is on development of 
therapies against diseases. 
  This program is designed, above all, to stimulate the use of 
exceptionally- high-capacity computers and automated techniques 
in analytical procedures for decoding genes as carriers which 
carry heredity information and thus the important life's 
important building blocks. Genome research should help make it 
increasingly possible to put medicine, the pharmaceutic 
industry, and agriculture on a new scientific basis. An example 
of successful genetically engineered production of drugs is the 
"Factor 8" against hemophilia, which until now had to be 
isolated from human blood. 
  According to expert estimates, over 4000 diseases at least 
can be traced to defects in biological building charts. 
Ernst-Ludwig Winnaker, director of the Genetics Center in 
Munich, reports that German researchers had played a substantial 
role in identifying the genetic causes of various diseases such 
as muscular ones and chorea, also heart and blood circulation 
diseases, and intestinal cancer. 
  Krueger points out that the U.S., Japanese, British, and 
French industries are already heavily engaged in this 
prospective field. This, in the opinion of specialists, requires 
that the licensing procedure be shortened. Looking at the soon 
to be amended Genetic Engineering Law, Axel Kleemann of the 
Pharmaceutic Works in Dresden has pointed out that it is not 
sufficient to correct the law but also the new rules must be 
better implemented.
