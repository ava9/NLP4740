  [Text] San Jose, 7 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican President 
Rafael Angel Calderon said today that his successor, Jose Maria 
Figueres, will receive a country in better shape than he did in 
1990, because poverty has been reduced and economic growth has 
increased. 
  After congratulating Figueres on his election victory over 
Social Christian Miguel Angel Rodriguez in yesterday's 
elections, the president noted that "we have a country with the 
highest growth in Latin America" (6.5 percent last year), which 
has reduced poverty from 23 to 17 percent and has brought the 
fiscal deficit under control, according to official figures. "I 
feel that the new president will bring his own ideas to the 
government and will have his focus, but it is very unlikely that 
the trend toward national unity will be broken," declared the 
head of state, who will surrender power on 8 May. 
  According to Calderon, the fiscal deficit projected for this 
year -- 1.5 percent of the GDP -- is five times less than that 
for 1990, when he assumed office from social democrat Oscar 
Arias, a fellow party member of Figueres. The president 
explained he hopes to meet in the next few days with Figueres to 
begin the transition process. 
  Calderon, 44, and Figueres, 39, are two of the youngest 
presidents in Costa Rican history. They are both sons of two of 
the most prominent leaders and former presidents the country has 
had in this century, Rafael Angel Calderon Guardia (1940-44) and 
Jose Figueres (1948-49, 1953-58, and 1970-74). The two former 
presidents were adversaries in a civil war in which the father 
of the next president of Costa Rica came out victorious and 
which marked the beginning of the model democracy this country 
has today.
