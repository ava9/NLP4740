  [Text] Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon met with 
President Guillermo Endara this morning to discuss several 
topics, including banana export problems. Amid tight security, a 
protocol ceremony was held at the stairs of the Presidency of 
the Republic to receive the Costa Rican president. The 
republican band played both national anthems to welcome Rafael 
Angel Calderon Fournier. 
  [Begin Calderon recording] We are both ending our respective 
terms. Currently, relations between Panama and Costa Rica are 
excellent and this is how they should always be between two 
fraternal countries. We are going to talk a bit about our 
bilateral relations and the banana situation which is so 
important for both countries, including the struggle in which 
all the Latin American banana-producing countries are engaged. 
[end recording] 
  Later the Panamanian president awarded Calderon the Manuel 
Amador Guerrera Order. In the presence of all his ministers 
Guillermo Endara recognized the neighboring country's support 
for Panama. President Calderon Fournier awarded the Panamanian 
president the Juan Mora Fernandez Order, represented by a gold 
plaque. Presenting Endara with the award, Calderon highlighted 
the role played by the president in the struggle against the 
military dictatorship.
