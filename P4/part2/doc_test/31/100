  [Text] Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus was hurt 
after his hopes to become OAS secretary general were dashed. 
Niehaus said the Inter-American system had committed another 
injustice against Costa Rica. The pressures exerted against the 
small countries were the main element that kept Costa Rica's 
40-year-old hope of becoming OAS secretary general from coming 
true. In 1954, former Costa Rican President Otilio Ulate Blanco 
was also defeated when he ran for the post of OAS secretary 
general. On this occasion, the excuse was the OAS needed a 
former president, and the big countries, headed by the United 
States, nominated Colombian President Cesar Gaviria. 
  Foreign Minister Niehaus said the attitude assumed by some 
of 
the small countries in light of those pressures was the main 
element of the defeat. 
  [Begin Niehaus recording] We did have a big problem with 
four 
Caribbean banana-producing countries. This problem has been 
present for some time, but it was used within the last few days 
to separate us and break the vote. We have had a very clear 
position regarding the banana issue. We are working on this, 
and, as far as I know, an agreement was reached in Brussels. 
This was done, however, without disregarding our national 
interests. Our country was interested in promoting my 
candidacy, but it could not do it at the cost of other 
interests. On different occasions I told the banana-producing 
countries our position was one of finding solutions that would 
not affect the Caribbean or our interests; we talked based on 
this issue. 
  Surprisingly enough, since 25 March, when the last 
successful 
contacts were made, these countries started talking about the 
Central American position. They started saying not only Costa 
Rica but other Central American countries were against them. 
What each country does is its own business. We cannot meddle 
in what Guatemala, Panama, or Honduras do about this. This 
began to sound like excuses, but they never told us they were 
going to break the commitment; this happened only today. 
  Yesterday during the Caribbean Common Market-Central America 
meeting support for Costa Rica was reiterated, but those four 
countries said nothing. Those countries are St. Lucia, St. 
Vincent, Grenada, and Dominica. Those countries remained 
silent, so I asked them if they authorized me to tell the press 
everything was all right and that nothing had changed. One of 
them, St. Lucia, said he had not talked about this. I told him 
I was not talking about a specific problem, rather, the vote, 
and he said yes. I then met with you and told you all was fine, 
but there was an underlying problem. 
  Last night I was told a meeting was going to be held and 
very 
faithful and serious countries, countries firm to their 
commitment, such as Jamaica, Trinidad-Tobago, Barbados, and 
Bahamas, said they would do all in their power to fix the 
situation. 
  Shortly before the voting began the St. Lucian ambassador 
came to see me and said there were four countries that were not 
happy with Costa Rica's banana policy. I told him I did not 
know why they were unhappy, because the Costa Rican president 
had been quite clear about this situation. Well, he said, let's 
wait and see what happens. At no time did we say--and this is 
all rumor--Guyana would not support me; quite the contrary, 
yesterday the foreign minister clearly told me he would support 
me. Today he told me he was told to vote against. Well. 
  There was one Central American dissident. I do not want to 
mention the name because I do not wish to harm bilateral 
relations. [end recording] 
  These were statements by Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus at 
the Costa Rican Embassy in Washington after studying the results 
of the election in which he was defeated by Colombian President 
Cesar Gaviria. According to versions heard throughout the 
diplomatic media in Washington, DC, Panama was the Central 
American country that at the last minute changed its vote and 
supported Colombia, as did the four Caribbean countries Foreign 
Minister Niehaus mentioned. 
  This closes another chapter in Costa Rica's hopes to hold 
the 
highest office at the OAS. 
  [Panama City ACAN in Spanish at 1719 GMT on 28 March cites 
San Jose LA NACION as reporting: "Panama broke its promise to 
Costa Rica and voted for Colombian President Cesar Gaviria for 
OAS secretary general." The ACAN report adds "Dominica, 
Ecuador, Grenada, Guyana, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and the 
Grenadines changed their vote at the last minute, thus enabling 
President Gaviria's victory.]"
