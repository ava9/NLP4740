  [Text] Taipei, May 2 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui will 
start his 13-day, four-country overseas tour Wednesday [4 May] 
with an aim toward promoting Taiwan's relations with its allies. 
  The tour will take Li to Nicaragua, Costa Rica, South Africa 
and Swaziland, all of which maintain close official relations 
with the Republic of China [ROC]. 
  President Li will sign joint communiques with Nicaraguan, 
Costa Rican and Swazi presidents pledging to continue 
strengthening bilateral relations, the ministry of foreign 
affairs said Monday. 
  Li is scheduled to arrive in Managua, Nicaragua on 
Wednesday, 
(local time) for a two-day visit, the ministry said. The 
Nicaraguan Government will give Li a 21-gun salute. 
  Li will deliver a speech to the Nicaraguan Congress on 
Thursday, and the congress will confer a medal to Li in 
recognition of his contribution to promoting ROC-Nicaraguan 
relations. Li will be the fourth recipient of such an honor. 
  Li will then fly to Costa Rica on Friday for a three-day 
visit. While there, he will attend the inauguration of 
President-Elect Jose Maria Figueres, which is scheduled to take 
place on Sunday. While there, Li will visit an export 
processing zone Taiwan's BES Engineering Corp. has built to 
attract Taiwan investment to the Central American country. 
  Li will then proceed to South Africa, where on may 10 he 
will 
attend the inauguration of the new South African president. 
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela is widely 
believed to have won that country's first multiracial 
presidential election. 
  The Foreign Affairs Ministry said it is arranging for 
meetings between Li and South African leaders, including Mandela 
and incumbent President F.W. de Klerk. 
  Li will fly to Swaziland May 12 for a state visit. In 
addition to meeting with Swazi King Mswati III, he will also 
visit a demonstration farm and a handicraft center that the ROC 
has helped establish there. 
  Li and his entourage are scheduled to return to Taipei May 
16. 
  This will be Li's first official overseas tour since he 
assumed the presidency in 1988. He made unofficial visits to 
Singapore in 1989 and to the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand 
in February this year. All four Southeast Asian countries 
recognize Beijing, while maintaining close economic ties with 
Taiwan.
