  [Text] Jose Maria Figueres gave his first news conference 
as president-elect of Costa Rica and reiterated his commitment 
to the needy, stating that his government will focus primarily 
on strengthening social programs. He added, however, that 
socioeconomic programs are two sides of the same coin as one 
cannot be separated from the other. He reiterated that during 
his administration important [word indistinct] will be made for 
the agriculture sector, as well as for small and medium 
producers, who will grow stronger as they are given the 
necessary resources. 
  Women will also play a leading role in the policies of the 
coming National Liberation Party administration. Figueres 
stated that his government will continue its efforts in the 
health and education sectors. He also reiterated his support 
for private education but added that public education must be 
improved to keep it at the same level as private education 
[words indistinct]. 
  Figueres said very significant trade relations will be 
generated with various nations with which current relations are 
maintained. Figueres said he will respect international 
financial organizations and international economic policies. 
However, he reiterated that his government does not approve of 
the (?third) structural adjustment program in its current form 
and said it must undergo several changes so it does not harm the 
country's less fortunate sectors. 
  Here is an excerpt of Jose Maria Figueres' statements at the 
Hotel Costa Rica: 
  [Begin Figueres recording] I am happy and very grateful for 
the trust and affection expressed by the Costa Rican people, a 
majority of whom voted for the National Liberation Party and 
allowed us to win the elections and to win in Congress. I am 
certain they will allow us to win a majority in the 
municipalities throughout the nation. 
  I think there were certain factors that could have caused 
objections to the final election results. Starting early in the 
afternoon I perceived an air of triumph among the National 
Liberation Party family when party members were saying we had 
won all across the nation. Some started to celebrate before the 
final results were in. You are the best witnesses that 
throughout the afternoon we used the media many times to urge 
people not to celebrate in advance and to work until 1800 or 
until we obtained [words indistinct]. 
  In any case, I want to reiterate my appreciation for the 
trust placed in us to fulfill the commitments we made during the 
campaign. It is time to leave differences aside, to unite the 
Costa Rican family, and to meet the goals we have set. [end
