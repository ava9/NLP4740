  [Text] Puntarenas -- Finance Minister Carlos Munoz said 
yesterday that the country will face difficulties in servicing 
the foreign debt and a reduction in available credit if the 
future administration decides to replace the PAE III [Economic 
Adjustment Program] with loans to specific sectors. 
  After saying it was inadvisable to continue "patching up the 
economy," the official asserted that opting for loans to 
specific sectors instead of the PAE III would entail at least 18 
months of negotiations. Thus, the official stated, the loan 
option is "ineffective." 
  Munoz was one of the main speakers at a economics seminar 
attended by 30 journalists at the Hotel Fiesta in Puntarenas. 
The seminar ended yesterday. 
  At that event, Munoz said the country should continue on the 
path to economic modernization, commercial opening, and smaller 
government. The finance minister emphasized that the Jose 
Maria Figueres Olsen administration, which will take office on 8 
May, could renegotiate PAE III with the World Bank. The 
minister pointed out, however, that the government would loose 
its ability to pay the foreign debt and, in this case, 
international creditors would probably withdraw our credit. 
  Central Bank President Jorge Corrales emphasized that the 
negotiation of separate loans to certain sectors as an 
alternative to the PAE III would lead to high payments by Costa 
Rica and -- in his opinion -- there are not enough resources for 
that. 
  President-elect Jose Maria Figueres said the debate on PAE 
III "had been overcome" when he met with President Rafael Angel 
Calderon Fournier. 
  The current government insists that this program, which will 
provide the country with $180 million, should be approved by the 
Legislative Assembly, while the future administration rejects 
the program because it believes that it was not negotiated "in a 
Costa Rican manner [a la tica]." 
  Minister Munoz asserted that the PAE III would integrate the 
Costa Rican economy into the new international commerce currents 
because it will increase productivity, reorganize the financial 
sector, promote savings, and guarantee more funds for social 
programs. He added that it would reduce poverty and 
unemployment and would allow the private sector to receive a 
flow of resources that would encourage production. 
  Commenting on the economic reforms by the Calderon Fournier 
administration, Munoz said: "This process cannot be a reversed. 
I don't believe the PLN [National Liberation Party] is thinking 
of canceling it because that would create serious problems for 
the country. The PAE III is necessary to maintain economic 
stability and foreign financing."
