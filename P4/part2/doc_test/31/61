  [Text] Economy Minister Roberto Rojas has announced that 
on 8 February the government contacted Jose Maria Figueres to 
ask him his opinion on the free trade treaty negotiations with 
Mexico. 
  By presidential order Rojas spoke with Figueres' economic 
advisers in order to inform the Mexicans [of Figueres' views]. 
"The president-elect's position is very important to us because 
he has made statements to the effect that he wants to reach an 
agreement with the approval of the private sector, which has 
been our policy," Rojas said. 
  On 9 February Rojas met with President Calderon and assured 
him that he expected white smoke from the following week's talks 
[with Figueres' advisers]. Calderon pointed out that with 
Figueres' approval he will be able to guarantee his Mexican 
counterpart, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, that the agreement will 
be confirmed by the Legislative Assembly without any problem 
whatsoever. 
  The agreement has been held back by farm-related 
regulations, 
specifically those that would give Costa Rican meat, sugar, and 
milk access to Mexico's market of 90 million consumers. 
  On 11 February Luis Tellez, Mexico's Assistant Secretary of 
Agriculture, is expected to arrive in Costa Rica, and on 14 
February Rojas will travel to Mexico City to continue the 
process with his counterpart, Jaime Serra Puche. 
  Rojas warned that agreements have already been reached on 
issues such as intellectual property, investments, and a 
well-balanced tariff package. Mexican producers will receive 
the same protection given to Costa Rican producers. "We are 
guaranteeing an active system to resolve any expropriations that 
may emerge." In the industrial sector, he said, there is 
consensus regarding the disproportional tariff system and a 
temporary solution has been established through the original 
regulations. The idea, he concluded, is to have products such as 
textiles accepted as if they were local raw material from the 
countries that signed the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA): United States, Mexico, and Canada.
