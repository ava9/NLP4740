  [Text] Four weeks before Costa Ricans wake up with a 
president-elect, the country's electoral situation does not yet 
allow a forecast of an undisputed winner for these elections. 
Had the elections been held during the previous week, however, 
Jose Maria Figueres [presidential candidate for the National 
Liberation Party, PLN] would have won with a 3-percent advantage 
over Miguel Angel Rodriguez [presidential candidate for the 
Social Christian Unity Party, PUSC]. 
  This is what we gather from the sixth weekly poll conducted 
by the Multispecialty Development Counselors (CID/Gallup) from 3 
to 6 January 1994, as part of the "1994 Electoral Campaign" 
series. The participants in this poll were 1,010 Costa Ricans 
from around the country, 510 interviewed in their homes and the 
rest via telephone. 
  The poll indicates that Costa Ricans are facing a campaign 
that is different from the others, as the personality of the 
candidates and their backgrounds are the focal point of the 
campaign, whereas ideas and programs have passed to second place 
in importance.

  The trend toward a near tie between Miguel Angel Rodriguez 
and Jose Maria Figueres, which prevailed in November, is 
repeated again in January, still with the opposition candidate 
in the lead. 
  When asking Costa Ricans for whom would they will vote if 
the 
elections were held today, 39.5 percent of the polled 
respondents gave their support to Figueres, while 35.5 percent 
supported Rodriguez. In that poll, 10.7 percent said they were 
undecided. 
  Upon asking that last group about their electoral 
inclination, should they be forced to choose, 4.6 percent said 
they favored the official candidate, and 3.6 percent favored the 
opposition candidate. 
  When these data are added, it turns out that the final vote 
inclination for Figueres is 43.1 percent, and for Rodriguez it 
is 40.1 percent. Regarding other preferences, Miguel Salguero 
of the Democratic Force Party got 4.1 percent; Jorge Gonzalez 
Marten of the National Independent Party, 0.6 percent; and other 
candidates, .6 percent. In the end, 3.4 percent remained 
undecided; 4.6 percent said they did not support any candidate, 
and 3.5 percent preferred not to respond. 
  We must cite that the poll has a margin of error of three 
points, more or less, which affects all the results; thus, the 
support for Figueres varies between 40.1 percent and 46.1 
percent, and the support for Rodriguez is between 37.1 percent 
and 43.1 percent. 
  Regarding the previous poll, which was published on 20 
December, Figueres' support dropped by 1.5 percent, whereas 
Rodriguez' increased by 1.3 percent. 
  The decrease in support for the green-and-whites [PUSC] is 
also observed when measuring the support for the political 
parties, as this week, the PLN has 45.8 percent of the followers 
while the PUSC has 37.3 percent. 
  In the previous survey, the Social Democratic Party 
garnered 47.5 percent of the votes, whereas the Social Christian 
Party got 38 percent. 
  The latest poll by Borge and Associates, conducted from 27 
to 
30 December, was also disclosed last week. The results put Jose 
Maria Figueres one point above Miguel Angel Rodriguez (41.6 
percent to 40.6 percent), although the PLN maintains a 
five-point lead over the ruling PUSC. 
  In terms of the political parties, the CID/Gallup studies 
indicate they have maintained the same level of support since 
August, when the first survey was taken following the June 
conventions. Figures shows that the gap between the candidates 
is narrowing, with Figueres dropping and Rodriguez gaining. 
Figueres enjoys the support of the majority of the electorate 
in the metropolitan area and voters less than 24 years old who 
have a secondary level education. Rodriguez, in turn, has the 
support of voters in the rest of the country, those less than 24 
years old who have at the most completed a primary level 
education and those who describe themselves as undecided. 
  By way of example, one has to note that other CID/Gallup 
polls taken a few weeks before the previous elections show 
levels of support similar to the ones the current candidates 
have. For instance, in November 1985 Oscar Arias had a backing 
of 45 percent, whereas Rafael Calderon had 43 percent. Four 
years later Carlos Manuel Castillo had a support of 38 percent, 
and Calderon 43 percent. To be sure, the characteristics of 
those campaigns were different than the current one, as was 
noted earlier. The electorate perceives Miguel Angel Rodriguez 
more positively than Jose Maria Figueres. A total of 50.6 
percent of Costa Ricans regard the Social Christian Party 
favorably and 30.2 percent unfavorably, leaving a positive 
balance of 20.4 percent. 
  Figures, in turn, receives a favorable opinion from 46.1 
percent of the people and an unfavorable opinion from 35.1 
percent. The difference is 11 points. 
  Comparing the results with the previous survey, Figures goes 
up 3.2 percent, whereas Rodriguez drops 2.9 percent.
