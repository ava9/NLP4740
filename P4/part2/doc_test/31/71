  [Text] San Jose, 8 May (ACAN-EFE) -- The presidents of five 
of the six Central American nations today analyzed in Costa Rica 
the conditions of the coffee and banana markets, agreed to reach 
a common agenda for the next American summits, and expressed 
their support for the integration of their countries and for the 
Guatemalan peace talks. The chiefs of state also agreed to find 
common grounds to negotiate a group free trade agreement with 
Colombia and Venezuela, because their countries have signed only 
bilateral agreements. 
  Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani, Nicaraguan President 
Violeta Chamorro, Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon Carpio, 
and Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina on 8 May had 
breakfast with the new Costa Rican president and signed a joint 
declaration stating their decision to continue on the path of 
integration. 
  Honduran President Carlos Reina said the Central American 
nations "will not go" to the December Inter-American meeting 
with U.S. President Bill Clinton "to ask questions"; "we will go 
there to discuss the interests of our region in view of the 
enormous economic market that has opened among Mexico, the 
United States, and Canada," he added. 
  Reina pointed out that Central Americans will go there 
"united and with sound proposals;" he also said the difficult 
part is not joining NAFTA (signed by those three countries); the 
difficult part lies in the negotiations themselves, because this 
agreement "reflects the economic globalization that is taking 
place under the current end-of-the-century conditions." 
  The mini-summit took place following the inaugural of Costa 
Rican President Jose Maria Figueres, who took office today. 
This mini-summit was held to analyze the advancements in 
regional integration and to prepare an agenda for the June 
Ibero-American Summit in Colombia and the summit in the United 
States. 
  Salvadoran President-elect Armando Calderon Sol, who will 
take office on 1 June, also attended the meeting; however, 
Panamanian President Guillermo Endara could not attend it 
because of the general elections taking place in his country 
today. 
  Figueres told the media he talked with his Central American 
colleagues about such economic issues as maintaining a partial 
hold on the coffee harvest by coffee-producing countries to 
pressure international markets to pay better prices. 
  He added they also talked about the banana trade between the 
isthmus and the EU. This trade triggered an economic and 
political crisis in 1993 when banana import restrictions were 
enforced. 
  In their joint declaration, the presidents called on the 
Guatemalan guerrillas to keep negotiating peace with the 
government, and according to Figueres, the chiefs of state are 
hopeful these peace negotiations will successfully end this year. 
  The Ramiro De Leon administration and the Guatemalan 
National 
Revolutionary Unity (URNG) last month agreed, along with 
international observers, on a calendar to hold negotiations and 
on a human rights agreement to end the last Central American 
armed conflict, which dates back to 1960. 
  The Central American presidents agreed that their foreign 
ministers will meet on 23 and 24 May in Guatemala and will draft 
an agenda to forge a common front to attend the Ibero-American 
Summit in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) on 14 June. 
  Figueres emphasized that the presidents will review this 
agenda in El Salvador on 1 June, when they will meet to attend 
Calderon Sol's inaugural. He also said a similar mechanism will 
be adopted prior to attending the Miami Summit that Clinton will 
hold in December 1994. 
  At the end of the meeting, Salvadoran President-elect 
Armando 
Calderon Sol said that Central American integration is a 
well-traveled path that we must continue to follow to give 
continuity to the agreements already achieved, mainly economic 
agreements. 
  The mini-summit of Central American presidents took place at 
a San Jose hotel shortly before Figures' inaugural.
