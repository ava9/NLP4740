FT  18 JUN 94 / Drilling for damages: The aftermath of an oil spill

The US is said to have more than a million millionaires. It may soon have
about 13,000 more. An Alaskan jury has to decide whether Exxon, the biggest
US company by sales, should pay maximum punitive damages of as much as
Dollars 15bn to those Alaskans who claim their lives or property were
damaged by the worst-ever oil spill in US waters.
This week a federal court jury in Anchorage, Alaska, found that reckless
conduct by Exxon and Mr Joseph Hazelwood, the captain of the Exxon Valdez,
contributed to the ship running aground shortly after it left the state's
main oil port of Valdez in March 1989.
Almost 11m gallons of crude oil spilled into Prince William Sound. In the
five years since the accident more than Dollars 3.5bn has seeped from
Exxon's cash flow to cover the cost of the clean-up and to settle federal
and state criminal charges.
Exxon, the world's biggest oil company, has also settled some civil claims
voluntarily. But there are 13,000 or so potential plaintiffs who could
benefit from this week's decision, including fishermen, local landowners and
native Americans.
Their lawyers will go before the same federal jury on Monday and ask the
nine women and three men to accept their claim for Dollars 1.5m in actual
damages, before setting punitive damages at Dollars 15bn. The jury is
expected to make its decision this summer. If it accepts the plaintiffs'
arguments, individual damages could average between Dollars 1.1m-Dollars
1.3m.
The case has sparked off intense speculation among oil industry observers
keen to calculate the potential damage to Exxon. It has also highlighted the
arbitrary way in which damages are awarded in US cases of corporate
negligence. IN addition, it could affect the tort law reform campaigns which
are under way in many states in US, following pressure from companies which
have been badly hit in product liability cases.
Mr Arthur Miller, law professor at Harvard Law School, notes that 'corporate
America is deathly afraid of punitive damages. It is the lifeblood of the
plaintiff.'
That point is not lost on Mr Brian O'Neill, lead attorney for the plaintiffs
in the Exxon case. The Dollars 15bn punitive damages claim is based on
Exxon's earnings, he says. 'Exxon has made in excess of Dollars 15bn net out
of the pipeline' which brings the oil from Alaska's North Slope to Valdez.
Exxon believes its past financial success should not be an issue in any
further damages award. But the court earlier rejected the company's request
that evidence about its financial position should not be presented to jury.
Mr John Hervey, vice-president of research at Wall Street brokers Donaldson,
Lufkin and Jenrette, believes 'Exxon's biggest liability is its ability to
pay'.
Uncertainty over the eventual level of pay-out has been exacerbated because
the US Supreme Court has never set standards for punitive damage awards. Its
guidance extends to two general areas. The first is that there must be some
relationship between the punitive damages and the actual damages. But there
is no guidance on whether that relationship should be two times, three
times, or a hundred times.
The Supreme Court says, secondly, that such awards should act as a
deterrent, but should not be excessive. The vagueness of that guideline
worries Mr Miller at Harvard. 'What will deter but not cripple? They've been
found reckless, but they're not Satanic . . . It's a wild card, and frankly,
it's what really frightens companies.'
Since this week's decision, Exxon's market capitalisation has fallen by
about Dollars 5bn. Industry observers say a decision to impose the maximum
Dollars 15bn penalty could cut its equity value. But the sheer size and
financial strength of Exxon is such that the company's survival would not be
jeopardised. That fact is beginning to sink in, and the share price, which
plummeted by 8 per cent on the news, has since recovered some of its lost
ground.
The swing in sentiment has been encouraged in part by a revision by many
analysts of the likely level of damages. Many now expect a pay-out in the
Dollars 6-Dollars 10bn range. Most are wary, however, of second-guessing a
jury assessing one of the country's most publicised and extensive
environmental disasters.
Mr Miller says this particular case 'has got to the heart of the economy and
society. It's not like dumping oil in the desert.'
But what could the effect of a big award against Exxon be on US industry? Mr
Miller believes 'corporate America would feel its usual sense of outrage
every time it gets kicked in the butt'.
Would the deterrent effect be widespread? 'That's what it is supposed to
do,' he says. 'Would it do it? There's no empirical evidence. But you have
to feel it has some effect.'
One of the ironies of the Exxon Valdez case is that Exxon is widely viewed
within the petroleum industry as perhaps the best-run and most technically
competent oil company in the world.
The plaintiffs will try to dispel that view by arguing that the company
consistently failed to deal with Captain Hazelwood's well-known drinking
problem.
'The people who knew about his problems didn't do anything. Dozens of
managers - the Gulf coast fleet management structure, the west coast fleet
management structure, the company's doctors - every single part of this
institution knew about this and didn't do anything,' says Mr O'Neill.
He attributes Exxon's failure in part to 'the lack of accountability you get
in a big organisation: (a belief that) someone else will do it'.
Exxon's public aloofness may help the plaintiffs in making such a case. The
company's public relations performance at the time of the disaster was
dismal. Mr Larry Rawl, the then chairman, declined to make a personal visit
to the site, saying it would make no difference to the clean-up operation.
That led to scathing treatment in the press, to the extent that the Exxon
Valdez incident is used by other oil companies as an example of how not to
deal with the media or the public in the aftermath of oil spills.
In recent years Exxon has built up a strong department of investor
relations, preferring to communicate directly to shareholders rather than
through the press and industry analysts. Observers who know the company well
say the isolation may be linked to a sense that it is being singled out for
what may prove the harshest punishment yet meted out to a US company.
But it can at least take some comfort that the incident occurred outside two
states where the penalties might have been far worse: California, the Exxon
Valdez's destination on its abortive journey, has the country's strictest
environmental laws; and Texas, Exxon's home base, where the juries
consistently find for plaintiffs.
