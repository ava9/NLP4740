<P>
The FBI said today it has opened an investigation into the nation's worst oil 
spill, the crash of the tanker Exxon Valdez off the Alaskan coast, to determine 
whether Exxon USA or its employees committed criminal violations of the Clean 
Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is focusing on whether the spill of 10 million gallons of 
crude oil constituted "a negligent discharge of a pollutant into navigable 
waters of the United States," bureau spokesman Bill Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure of the FBI's involvement came a day after Exxon fired the tanker 
captain, Joseph Hazelwood, upon receiving a report from federal investigators 
that he had failed a blood-alcohol test taken 10 hours after the accident, 
meaning he was drunk by legal definition. 
</P>
<P>
Only Tuesday, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said the Justice Department is 
monitoring the developments in Alaska, but would not "send the sleuths in" to 
investigate until the cleanup was under control. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said in a statement that "the FBI's Anchorage field office is conducting 
an investigation into the oil spill" in Alaska's Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Possible Criminal Violations' 
</P>
<P>
"The FBI's investigation is focusing on possible criminal violations of the 
Clean Water Act, Title 33, USC (United States Code) Section 1251 and 
specifically, negligent discharge of a pollutant into navigable waters of the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
That section carries penalties ranging from fines of $50,000 per day to five 
years' imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
"This investigation is being fully coordinated with the Environmental 
Protection Agency, the Department of Justice's Land and Natural Resources 
Division, the U.S. Coast Guard, the National Transportation Safety Board, the 
U.S. attorney's office and the Alaska attorney general's office," the statement 
said.
