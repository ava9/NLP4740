NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN STATE, EXXON STALL ON GUARANTEE AGAINST DISCHARGE

The state and Exxon Shipping Co. had not reached agreement late Thursday on 
conditions under which the crippled tanker Valdez will be allowed to enter 
state waters for repairs, primarily because of disagreement over the wording of 
a demand stipulating that no discharge from the vessel enter the waters. 
</P>
<P>
At issue was the definition of discharge and the company's inability to 
guarantee that discharges from the damaged ship would not affect state waters, 
a source close to the proceedings said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, divers hired by Exxon to remove six steel plates dangling from the 
ship's hull late Thursday were trying to begin working on the tanker, now 
drifting 7 to 10 miles northeast of San Clemente Island. Rough swells were 
hampering the efforts, the U. S. Coast Guard reported. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting Here Tuesday 
</P>
<P>
A state Assembly committee on oil spill prevention and response, formed after 
the Valdez disaster in Alaska and three subsequent spills, said it will meet in 
San Diego on Tuesday to hear testimony about the condition of the Valdez since 
it arrived offshore July 9. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the state and Exxon continued late into the night, but 
were not expected to be completed until today. A state demand that Exxon post a 
$20-million line of credit for liability, in case it breaks the agreement, was 
not a critical point of debate, the source said. He added that he was uncertain 
whether the amount had been negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of several state agencies, including the Lands Commission, 
Department of Fish and Game and Regional Water Quality Control Board, met early 
Thursday morning and talked with Exxon officials later that afternoon, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are several balls in the air at the same time," Anthony Summers, a 
deputy state attorney general, said early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon officials would not comment on the negotiations, saying only that the 
company's objective is to come up with something it and the state "can live 
with." 
</P>
<P>
A clause in the state's 12-page list of conditions, issued to Exxon on Tuesday, 
stipulates that "there shall be no discharge of waste from the Exxon Valdez 
into or affecting (state) waters." Exxon officials indicated during Thursday's 
meetings that, because of the ship's damaged hull, they could not guarantee 
that no discharge of any kind would occur, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
The ship would enter state waters -- which extend 3 miles from the coast -- to 
remove the plates, reach dry dock in San Diego Bay or both. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sporadic Discharges 
</P>
<P>
The Valdez is believed to have caused an 18-foot slick that tests showed 
contained equal parts of weathered crude oil and marine life. Last week the 
ship sporadically discharged small amounts of a bluish substance from its 
starboard side. But no discharge has been seen since Sunday, the Coast Guard 
said, although the tanker is still a suspect as the cause of several sheens 
spotted earlier this week about 13 miles south of it. 
</P>
<P>
The state has also demanded that Exxon concede that the 987-foot tanker dumped 
oil during its 2,200-mile trip to San Diego from Alaska. But company officials 
have been reluctant to make such a concession, describing the discharges and 
the 18-mile slick as "organic material" with a "hydrocarbon content." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon officials have maintained that the oil content in the discharges was 
probably caused by the scouring effect of the sea on the lower depths of the 
Valdez's tanks, which still held a waxy residue of oil and had not come clean 
in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Samples taken from the ship's tanks, from discharge from the tanker and from 
sheens sighted near the ship are being analyzed, and results are expected 
within several days. 
</P>
<P>
Offshore, divers hired to remove the steel plates from the hull entered the 
waters around the tanker, but were forced out by rough swells of up to 7 feet, 
the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Permission to Move 
</P>
<P>
The ship was expected to move late Thursday to calmer waters closer to shore. 
Coast Guard Cmdr. Don Montoro gave Exxon permission to move to waters within 6 
miles of the coast, said Lt. Larry Solberg. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the federal agency nor Exxon was certain when the plate removal could 
begin, or whether it could be accomplished under open-seas conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Removal of the plates, which peeled back from the hull during the trip from 
Alaska and now prevent the ship from entering San Diego Bay for repairs, could 
take five to seven days. The plates jut down as much as 70 feet from the bottom 
of the ship. 
</P>
<P>
"We still think it's a legitimate option. But obviously, we want the divers to 
be safe," said Jan Cool, a spokeswoman for Exxon Shipping. 
</P>
<P>
The divers had tested the waters Wednesday, and an emergency drill required by 
the Coast Guard to test the response of the Valdez crew and equipment was 
completed Thursday, after a supply and recovery boat ready to handle oil 
discharges or spills was deployed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The recovery boat, a salvage vessel operated by the diving company and three 
tugboats that towed the Valdez from Alaska now surround the drifting ship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drill Goes Well 
</P>
<P>
"The drill was satisfactory. Everybody on scene agreed the equipment provided 
by Exxon . . . was adequate to be able to handle any pollution incident," 
Solberg said. "So as long as (the divers) have assessed that it's safe to do 
the operation, we've given them permission to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon's Cool said Wednesday that, although some plate removal might be done 
outside state waters, the ship still will need to enter the coastal zone to 
finish the removal or for follow-up repairs. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter where the plates are removed, the ship will face state scrutiny 
when it enters San Diego Bay, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker was towed from Alaska after hitting a reef and causing the nation's 
worst oil spill, along the Prince William Sound shoreline. The ship was 
scheduled to enter San Diego Bay on July 11 for a $25-million, nine-month 
repair job at National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co., which built the vessel in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
But the discovery July 10 of the jutting plates, as well as the slicks and 
discharges, delayed its entry.
