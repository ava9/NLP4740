The Coast Guard said in Anchorage, Alaska, that it wants Exxon Corp. to finish 
cleaning the still-oily shores of Alaska by Aug. 15.

<P>
The federal on-scene coordinator of the Exxon Valdez oil spill cleanup, Coast 
Guard Rear Adm. David Ciancaglini, changed Exxon's work plan to require that 
the oil company take additional steps to protect the environment during the 
second year of cleaning up oil spilled when its tanker ran aground in Prince 
William Sound last year. Ciancaglini ordered Exxon not to leave treated beaches 
in a disturbed condition. He told the company that once its crews have removed 
oil from a beach, they should return it to its earlier shoreline profile.
