A defense request to sequester the jury in the Anchorage trial of the captain 
of the Exxon Valdez to shield them from publicity of the approaching 
anniversary of the nation's worst oil spill was rejected by state Superior 
Court Judge Karl Johnstone. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnstone granted the defense what it called a "major victory" in ruling 
that Joseph Hazelwood could not be considered guilty of acting recklessly for 
attempting to dislodge the grounded tanker from Bligh Reef. The Exxon Valdez on 
March 24, 1989, spilled about 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William 
Sound, and Hazelwood is charged with reckless endangerment, operating the 
tanker while intoxicated, negligent discharge of oil and criminal mischief. 
Closing arguments are expected next week.
