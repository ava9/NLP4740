15 PRIVATE GUARDS HIRED TO PROTECT AMERICAN EMBASSY ARRESTED BY PANAMA POLICE

<TEXT>
<P>
In an escalation of the confrontation between the U.S. diplomatic mission here 
and Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, Panamanian police have arrested 15 private guards 
hired to protect the American Embassy and its employees. 
</P>
<P>
During the week, the National Department of Investigation has rounded up the 
guards and two office workers, all employees of the Tesna-Mimsa security 
company, and has held them without charges in the Ancon Prison. 
</P>
<P>
Embassy spokesman Terrence Kneebone said Friday that the arrest of the guards 
has not yet "compromised" the security of the embassy or its employees. "We are 
not going to leave unguarded any post nor leave any person insecure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests are the latest in a series of confrontations between the Noriega 
regime and the United States growing out of a crisis in which American federal 
grand juries have indicted the general on drug-trafficking and other charges, 
and Washington has sought his removal from power. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the face-offs here in Panama have involved the military of both 
countries, but there have been sporadic problems for the diplomats, and several 
of them have been assigned bodyguards and have been trained to use weapons 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Panamanian officials declined to confirm the detention of the embassy guards, 
but a lawyer hired by their company has been allowed to see them in prison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regime Has Two Aims 
</P>
<P>
Kneebone said reports of the interrogation of the guards, all Panamanian 
citizens, indicates the government has two aims. First is to "highlight the 
connection" between the embassy and Guillermo (Billy) Ford, a leader of the 
local political opposition trying to oust Noriega. One of Ford's bodyguards was 
killed last week when government security forces attacked an anti-government 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
The dead bodyguard, Alexis Guerra, was a Tesna-Mimsa employee who had been 
Kneebone's personal bodyguard until mid-April, when he took a leave of absence 
to guard Ford. Ford was one of two vice presidential candidates on the 
opposition ticket in fraud-tainted May 7 elections that authorities have since 
annulled. 
</P>
<P>
Kneebone said that the Noriega government evidently wants to tie Guerra and 
Ford to the embassy in an move to try to prove that the local opposition is 
under the influence of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a way to create propaganda and a hullabaloo," Kneebone said, "but we 
really don't care. This government (Panama's) has no credibility." 
</P>
<P>
The other reason for the arrests, according to Kneebone's information, "is to 
strip away embassy security." 
</P>
<P>
The captured guards are being asked, the embassy spokesman said, "where the 
guard posts are, when the ones which aren't manned 24 hours are manned, how the 
guards are transported, the shift changes and radio frequencies." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know how much they already know; we assume a lot," Kneebone said, but 
this apparent attempt to find out more is worrisome. "We will study the 
situation and take whatever measures are necessary" to insure embassy security, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refused to Leave Panama 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, who was declared persona non grata by the Noriega regime last 
year but who refused to leave the country on grounds that the order was issued 
by an illegal government, said that remaining guards are enough at the moment 
for adequate protection. He added that several have been sleeping in the 
embassy and other U.S. offices here. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, Tesna-Mimsa provides 73 guards to protect the embassy office 
building, the American Consulate, the ambassador's residence and various 
facilities located in office buildings throughout Panama City. In addition, 
certain diplomats are given personal bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
This is on top of a undisclosed number of U.S. Marines assigned to the embassy 
but limited to protecting the chancery, as the embassy office building is 
called, and the consulate. 
</P>
<P>
Under a Panamanian decree issued earlier this year, the guards are supposed to 
be unarmed. Kneebone refused to comment when asked if the decree is being 
followed. He also pointed out that employees of other supposedly private 
security firms, some owned by Noriega or his close associates, continue 
carrying weapons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Embassy Only Client 
</P>
<P>
Tesna-Mimsa has a security contract for the embassy, its only client, in 
association with a Columbus, Ohio, firm, DOD Contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Kneebone said that the National Department of Investigation, known by its 
Spanish initials as DENI, began arresting the guards earlier in the week after 
asking them to come in for questioning. (DENI is a division of the Panama 
Defense Forces, the nation's sole military and police organization, commanded 
by Noriega.) 
</P>
<P>
Others were rounded up Wednesday and Thursday, including Maria Isabel Angisola, 
wife of Tesna-Mimsa owner Sergio Angisola and her brother, Alfonso Marino. Both 
work for the company. Angisola has not been located. 
</P>
<P>
Kneebone said the police first picked up Maria Isabel Angisola and then told 
her brother that she would be released if he brought in company documents. He 
did as ordered, but neither was released. 
</P>
<P>
The incident comes as the embassy staff and the personnel of other U.S. 
government offices are being scaled down to protest Noriega's refusal to accept 
the apparent defeat his regime suffered in the May 7 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Arthur Davis left Monday for "consultations" in Washington, and the 
rest of the staff will be reduced to 45 from the 101 who were posted here April 
1. Left behind will be "essential" diplomats, communications experts, 
secretaries and Marine guards. 
</P>
<P>
Until the current crisis developed two years ago, there were 250 American 
personnel working in Panama for 18 U.S. agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Included among those that will have left by the end of May is the office of the 
Drug Enforcement Administration, one of the few U.S. agencies that continued 
working with Panama's government as other contacts were severed. 
</P>
<P>
Although the DEA says this cooperation had resulted in several successful 
anti-drug operations, embassy sources said that Washington had decided the 
agency's operations are not vital.
