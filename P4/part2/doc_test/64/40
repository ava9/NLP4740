Vice President Dan Quayle's three-day mission to help repair damage to ties 
with Latin America ended on a sour note today with Jamaican Prime Minister 
Michael Manley telling him the U.S. invasion of Panama and arrest of Manuel A. 
Noriega violated international law. 
</P>
<P>
"We exchanged views on Panama and we are friends, but friends do not always 
agree," Manley told reporters after a meeting with Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle was greeted warmly in Panama on Sunday by many Panamanians who told him 
they were thankful the United States had stepped in to oust Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
But today, Manley, while condemning Noriega as a "menace" to the region, said 
his ouster in the U.S. invasion violated world law. 
</P>
<P>
He said that while opposing Noriega, "we also feel very strongly about the 
principles of sovereignty and the principles that are involved by the invasion 
of one country by another." 
</P>
<P>
"We made it clear . . . that we do not agree with the invasion," Manley said of 
talks he described as "frank and useful" -- diplomatic jargon for blunt. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials have acknowledged privately that ambitious plans for 
Quayle's diplomatic mission had to be abandoned after most of Latin America, 
including U.S. neighbor Mexico, refused to welcome a visit so soon after the 
invasion.
