WON'T HELP NORIEGA EVADE JUSTICE, VATICAN SAYS;

<P>
Soft-pedaling its diplomatic differences with the United States, the Vatican 
said Saturday that it does not intend to help deposed dictator Manuel A. 
Noriega evade justice by granting him refuge in its embassy in Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
A communique from the Vatican's Secretariat of State one day after the Vatican 
criticized harassment by U.S. troops surrounding the embassy was a clear 
peace-seeking gesture, in the judgment of Vatican observers. 
</P>
<P>
In the first public comment from the Vatican secretariat overseeing 
negotiations, Saturday's statement said that "close contacts" continue with the 
United States "in a spirit of serene collaboration" to find a "just and 
mutually acceptable solution" to what it called a complex case. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Vatican, sensitive to complaints from Roman Catholics for having 
sheltered Noriega in the first place, warned the United States against 
"interference" with its diplomatic rights. 
</P>
<P>
By the standards of a traditional, close-mouthed foreign ministry which 
observes strict protocol and measures policy by decades, badgering an embassy 
with loud music and frisking its personnel, as U.S. troops have done, is 
boorish and counterproductive, one Vatican analyst said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the apparent lack of movement reflected in Saturday's 
statement suggested to observers that the Vatican foresees no end to the 
impasse before the New Year. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, whose military government was toppled by a Dec. 20 American invasion, 
entered the Vatican nunciature one week ago today in flight from U.S. troops 
seeking to arrest him to face drug trafficking charges in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"The apostolic nuncio had no intention of obstructing the course of justice 
regarding a person who is accused of grave crimes," the secretariat's statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Admitted to the embassy in what the Vatican calls a correct decision of the 
papal nuncio, Archbishop Jose Sebastian Laboa, Noriega has remained 
incommunicado there while the diplomatic tempest rages around him. 
</P>
<P>
International conventions subscribed to by Latin American republics as well as 
the United States and the Vatican provide the right of political asylum but 
offer no protection to common criminals. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican said Friday that no decision had been taken on Noriega's request 
for political asylum. Instead, he has "temporary political refuge" at the 
nunciature but is being encouraged to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The former strongman will not be forced to go, however, the Vatican says. 
Neither, Vatican diplomats insist, is there any legal way that a diplomatic 
mission accredited to Panama can turn him over directly to the United States, 
which the Vatican regards juridically as "an occupying power." 
</P>
<P>
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro would not elaborate on the brief secretariat 
statement Saturday but indicated that the Vatican had still not received a 
letter written earlier this week in which Guillermo Endara, Panama's new 
president, asked that Noriega be expelled from his sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout a tense week of negotiations, the Vatican has hinted repeatedly that 
it would look favorably on a formal request from Panama for Noriega to face 
criminal charges there. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts here conclude that Endara sees nothing to gain for Panama by relieving 
the Vatican of a hot potato. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, for its part, says that Panamanian stability cannot be 
assured while Noriega remains in the country. There has been no attempt by the 
Holy See to locate a third country willing to accept Noriega, the Vatican has 
said repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
Once again Saturday the Vatican defended Laboa's acceptance of Noriega's 
request for shelter, saying he acted "to help end a conflict which in the 
previous days had provoked great destruction and many victims." 
</P>
<P>
L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's official newspaper, made no mention 
Saturday of the diplomatic standoff with the United States. Instead, it 
published statements from three Panamanian bishops, and from Cardinal John J. 
O'Connor of New York, hailing Laboa's action in what O'Connor called 
"effectively neutralizing Noriega and his violent stand."
