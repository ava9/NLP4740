Technicians replaced a faulty engine part Thursday aboard the shuttle Atlantis, 
as NASA managers reviewed plans to launch the spacecraft at the end of the 
month on a crucial flight to deploy a probe to Venus. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day "flight readiness review," an exhaustive assessment of shuttle 
launch processing, began at 8 a.m. at the space center and ran late into the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Among those present was Navy Rear Adm. Richard H. Truly, a former astronaut and 
associate administrator for space flight whom President Bush said Wednesday he 
would nominate to serve as NASA's next administrator.

Probe to Map Venus 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis is scheduled to blast off April 28 with a crew of five to launch the 
Magellan probe, which will continue on a 15-month voyage to Venus. Magellan is 
scheduled to map at least 90% of the planet's surface, which would increase 
knowledge about the evolution of Earth's solar system. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's shuttle processing schedule 
does not include additional time to resolve problems, which is what engineers 
encountered Wednesday night.
