12-YEAR GRAND TOUR BEGINS TO END;

A dozen years. Time enough for a toddler to become a teen-ager, for a fledgling 
scientist to become a veteran, for arcane technologies to become everyday. Time 
enough for an 1,800-pound package of primitive electronics to skate more than 4 
billion miles toward the stars. 
</P>
<P>
And time enough for the 300 people who remain part of the Voyager 2 team to 
take stock of memories built up over years of planning, engineering and 
executing their grand tour of four planets. Especially for the estimated 10 to 
20 scientists and engineers who have been around since the very beginning, the 
tour's finale at Neptune this week is a time of bittersweet recollection. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart (Andy) Collins, 42, is one of those whose careers was built on Voyager; 
in 1970 he came to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a 23-year-old, straight out 
of college, and then joined the Voyager planning team shortly after the program 
began in 1972. He has since moved on to supervise JPL's development of light 
detection equipment for other space missions. 
</P>
<P>
Collins remembers that his son, Brian, now 12, said one of his first words in 
1979 when Voyager flew by the solar system's largest planet: "Jupiper." 
</P>
<P>
"He's our launch boy," Collins said, explaining that Brian was born a few 
months before Voyager's launch in August, 1977. "And our daughter, we think of 
her as Encounter plus 20 days, because she was born 20 days after the second 
Jupiter flyby. And our latest is Encounter minus 17 days." 
</P>
<P>
Marie Collins was born Aug. 7, as the laboratory in Pasadena geared up for 
Voyager 2's pass by Neptune. That close encounter will come at 8:56 p.m. 
tonight, when Voyager will fly just 3,000 miles from Neptune's swirling clouds. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Neptune mission will not be considered finished until Oct. 2, the 
close approach marks the beginning of the end of a program that has changed not 
just astronomy textbooks but also the lives of those who have been dedicated to 
it. Their days, they say, will always carry reminders of Voyager. 
</P>
<P>
"Voyager has spoiled me for anything else," Collins said. "I'm reconciled to 
the fact that whatever comes next probably won't be nearly as satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
The Voyager experience has also shaped the life of Christopher P. Jones, 
section manager for guidance and control systems at JPL. He joined Voyager in 
1973, one year after the program officially began. 
</P>
<P>
All the years of planning for every conceivable disaster in Voyager's clunky 
computers -- something he now does for all JPL missions -- changed his 
personality, Jones said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
"I always have contingency plans. I'm always thinking ahead, and never 
optimistically," Jones said. He checks to see if there is air in the spare 
tire. He builds time into his schedule so he will not be late. He knows which 
route he will take if the freeway off-ramp is closed. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes across as a pessimistic view of life, but in fact it's more insurance 
than anything else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones and his colleagues had to imagine every improbable glitch along the 
4.4-billion-mile journey to Neptune, equipping Voyager's six computers both for 
frontier science and to correct problems as they developed. But they only had 
28,000 bytes of computer memory to do it with -- 35 times less than the memory 
of Jones' desktop computer of today. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, now that scientists can stop worrying about nursing the aging 
spacecraft past another planet, they can sit back and laugh affectionately at 
its outdated technology. 
</P>
<P>
When Voyager 1 and 2 flew by Jupiter in 1979, the days before George 
Lucas-style supercomputer graphics, the Voyager team used laborious techniques 
to make a motion picture of the rotating gases and famous red spot, Collins 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Several dozen images taken in sequence were processed individually at JPL, with 
extra care taken so they would all be in the same scale. The images were given 
to a film recorder to be converted into large transparencies. These then were 
trundled off to a Hollywood animation house, where they were sequenced onto 
film -- "like Disney would do," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
"VCRs weren't what they are today. Back then, if you didn't have 16-millimeter 
film, nobody would know how to show it," Collins said. "Today, you'd do the 
processing, record the images right onto a videodisc and play them onto 
videotape." Instant movie. 
</P>
<P>
Voyager's television cameras, called vidicons, also find it hard to get 
respect. Although they were the state of the art in the late 1960s, their light 
sensitivity is many times less than that of the silicon-chip-based cameras that 
have since become standard fare of home videotapers, noted Bradford A. Smith of 
the University of Arizona, leader of the imaging team since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"You just couldn't even compare the two," Smith said. "Vidicons are just the 
last thing in the world that anyone would want to fly." 
</P>
<P>
For Linda Horn, infrared experiment specialist for Voyager, the mission opened 
up a magical world that she had dreamed about since childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a little telescope when I was a girl, and I used to look at the planets 
and the stars," said Horn, who joined the Voyager team shortly before the 1977 
launch. "To actually come to JPL, get on a space mission and then go to the 
launch -- talk about enthusiastic." 
</P>
<P>
She and others involved with Voyager emphasize the team nature of the project, 
the kind of effort that makes lifelong friends. 
</P>
<P>
Said Collins: "It was always staffed with just enough people. By that I mean 
everyone had to do his job well, because there wasn't a second person there to 
do it for them. So you develop a lot of good relationships with your 
co-workers." 
</P>
<P>
This sense of the end of something unique and wondrous is common among these 
interplanetary pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to go back to Neptune in our lifetimes," Jones said. "To be 
able to participate in an enterprise like Voyager is a special, one-time 
chance. It's like being around when Columbus discovered America." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he remains convinced that Voyager is scientifically the most 
productive, most exciting space mission ever. 
</P>
<P>
"Just look at Neptune," Smith said. "The whole system is so photogenic and so 
exciting. You've got the atmosphere which is much more active than what we had 
ever expected it to be. There are dynamics there that we don't understand. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what makes missions exciting. If you immediately understand what you're 
looking at, that's no fun. It's when you see things that just leave you lying 
awake at night thinking about them, and then you eventually figure out what 
it's all about -- that's the fun part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Charley Kohlhase, mission design manager and a primary mover in Voyager since 
the early days, is spending this week careening from scientific meeting to 
press briefing to official reception, trying not to look too rumpled for the TV 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
One morning early in the week, he paused briefly to talk about both the 
excitement and the sadness he is feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just exhilarating now. The problem will come next Monday or Tuesday," 
Kohlhase said. "The press will pick up and leave, all the trailers will go. 
We'll look at Neptune and it'll be shrinking smaller and smaller in the 
pictures, and even only barely be seen as a small crescent. And we'll know that 
the last big picture show is ended." 
</P>
<P>
His comfort comes not from looking forward to other space missions, but from 
turning homeward. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a grandson only a year and a half old, and I love to go hiking in the 
Sierra," he said. "Ten or 12 years from now I'll be hiking, and some night 
after the sun's down and the stars are up and I'm telling him stories, I'm 
going to look up and see Sirius." 
</P>
<P>
Voyager will be headed toward Sirius, the brightest star in the heavens, after 
it leaves our solar system. "And I'll reflect back and tell him stories that he 
can share and pass on to the generations," Kohlhase said, "and I guess amaze 
him a little bit."
