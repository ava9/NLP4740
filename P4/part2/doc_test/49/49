  [Text] The Daboa Youth Association has appealed to the 
government to take the necessary action to protect the lives and 
property of the Dagombas, Gonjas, and Nanumbas now that they 
have surrendered their arms to the military task force. The 
appeal was contained in a statement issued in Tamale and signed 
by the northern regional president of the association, Mr. 
Mohammed Mumuni. 
  The association pointed out that despite the recent 
directives of the task force commandant to the Konkomba warriors 
to gather at certain designated areas for the disarming process, 
they have flouted these orders and are still attacking and 
burning down villages. It cited the cases of Tabia and Sanye 
which were attacked and burned last week resulting in the loss 
of lives and damage to property. The association expressed 
concern about the alarming rate of displaced persons and 
appealed for more relief aid for them.
