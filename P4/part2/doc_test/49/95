<F P=106> [Report on statement to parliament by the Finance Ministry </F>
on the 1994 budget -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] The government has decided to raise the tax-free 
concession from 150,000 to 210,000 cedis per annum. The tax 
rate applicable to other lower income earners has also been 
reduced. This is to prevent individuals in the lower income 
group from being liable to higher taxes in view of the recent 
increase in the minimum wage. This was contained in this year's 
budget proposal presented to parliament today by the minister of 
finance, Dr. Kwesi Botchwey. 
  Other tax rates on personal incomes are as follows: From 
291,000 to 392,850 cedis will attract 5 percent; and 431,000 to 
573,300 cedis, 10 percent. On indirect taxes and import duties 
on all goods which are imported under exemption and 
concessionary rates, will now attract a rate of 10 percent, 
while those classified as standard and luxury will now attract 
25 percent. [sentence as heard] 
  In the case of sales tax, imports, the rates of goods 
classified as concessionary and standard have been reduced to 15 
percent while those for luxury goods remain at 35 percent. 
Building materials will now attract a concessionary rate of 10 
percent import duty. Dr. Botchwey explained that this has become 
necessary in view of the gross abuse of the decision to remove 
all customs and import duties on certain building materials. 
  On the question of Ghana Investment Center concessions, the 
government is of the view that the exemptions of saloon cars, 
office equipment, and consumables are excessive and unnecessary 
for the effective promotion of investment in the country. In 
this regard, granting of these exemptions will be thoroughly 
reviewed. 
  Dr. Botchwey said the government has also responded to the 
complaints of manufacturers by looking more closely at the 
structure of existing tariffs with a view to ensuring that there 
is no unintended but inherent discrimination against domestic 
producers. Therefore, finished imported commodities will in 
future not attract less taxes than the amount payable on their 
domestically produced equivalent merely by underdeclaration of 
value of the competing imports. 
  On petroleum duties, Dr. Botchwey said an amount of 216.8 
billion cedis has been projected as petroleum tax this year. 
And to obtain this revenue, it is proposed that petroleum 
prices be increased by an average of 18 percent and remove the 
subsidy on premix. The increase in the price of kerosene will 
be 10 percent. 
  Dr. Botchwey explained that in view of the dramatic changes 
in the subregion, especially the devaluation of the CFA [franc] 
and the policy changes in Nigeria, it would not be in the 
national interest to keep prices at the 1993 levels. He said 
for some time now, many importers have been buying all kinds of 
goods including secondhand or used goods into the country under 
the trade liberalization scheme. Some of these have proved to 
be harmful to the health of the users. Accordingly, he proposed 
the banning of secondhand goods such as undergarments, towels, 
socks, handkerchiefs, bedsheets, pillowcases, mattresses, and 
sanitary wear. 
  On general economic targets, Dr. Botchwey said real GDP 
[gross domestic product] is expected to grow by 5 percent and 
end of period inflation rate, 15 percent. An overall balance of 
payment surplus of $180 million is to be achieved. A budget 
surplus of 68 billion cedis is also expected. 
  He said to achieve these targets and create the foundation 
for accelerated growth, it will be necessary to raise the 
investment-GDP ratio to at least 15 percent this year from 12.9 
percent in 1992. This, he said, is to be financed by increases 
in domestic savings. 
  Consequently, the government's role in savings mobilization 
effort will be crucial, as it would be expected to reverse the 
huge fiscal deficits generated over the last two years into a 
substantial surplus to be channeled into productive investment 
in both the private and public sectors of the economy. 
  Dr. Botchwey said the 1994 budget provides for total 
appropriation of about 1,000 billion cedis, while total revenues 
including grants are projected at 1,078 billion cedis, 
(?implying) a surplus of 68 billion cedis. [as heard] He said 
to achieve this target, there is the need for further 
streamlining of the tax system, improvement in the efficiency of 
tax administration, reform of the tax structure, as well as the 
elimination of the lapses in tax administration. 
  With regard to expenditures, he said they have been 
programmed to support income-generating activities and poverty 
alleviation through income redistribution. 
  Total expenditures have been projected to rise from a 
provisional outturn in 1993, from 782.9 billion cedis to 1,000 
billion -- a rise of 29 percent. Recurrent expenditures will 
amount to 742.4 billion cedis compared to 596.6 billion in 1992. 
Expenditure on personal emoluments is to rise to 274.5 billion 
cedis from 227.6 billion. 
  Negotiations are to be conducted with the Civil Servants 
Association within the framework of the civil service machinery 
to determine the appropriate parameters for income policy for 
the year. 
  Outlays for repairs, maintenance, and renewals are projected 
to rise by 27.7 percent to 114.4 billion as against a 
provisional outturn of 91.1 billion cedis last year. 
  Dr. Botchwey said education and health sectors are to have 
larger allocations to enable them to improve upon their 
services. The education sector will be expected to provide more 
textbooks and other accessories, while the health sector will 
concentrate on an accelerated rehabilitation of health 
facilities as well as the provision of adequate drugs and 
dressings. 
  He said the allocation for subvented organizations has been 
projected to rise to 95.1 billion from 75 billion in 1992 -- an 
increase of 26.8 percent. Also, transfers in respect of 
pensions, gratuities, and social security contributions are 
estimated at 79.7 billion compared to 64.8 billion in 1993 -- a 
rise of 22.9 percent. 
  Dr. Botchwey said interest on domestic debt is expected to 
rise from 91.9 billion cedis in 1993 to 114.2 billion in 1994. 
This increase, he said, is due to the large bank and nonbank 
borrowing to finance the deficit in 1993. Interest on external 
debt is to rise from 43.9 billion in 1993 to 61.3 billion in 
1994. Dr. Botchwey explained that the increase is mainly due to 
expected exchange rate depreciation.
