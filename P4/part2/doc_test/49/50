  [Text] The need for the general public to cooperate with 
and assist law enforcement agencies in checking drug abuse, 
peddling, and exportation, has again been raised by the law 
enforcement agencies. The concern was expressed by Mr. Robert 
Ayalingo and Mr. F.K. Amuzu of CEPS [Customs, Excise and 
Preventive Service] at a seminar organized by the International 
Council on Alcohol and Addictions on drug smuggling by 
Ghanaians. George Lawson's report is read to you. [read by 
announcer] 
  There is increasing anxiety by the international community 
over the drug menace which is causing human destruction, 
threatening the security and future of many nations. Mr. Robert 
Ayalingo pointed out that the greater percentage of violent 
crimes such as murder and armed robbery are committed by people 
under the influence of drugs. 
  Mr. Ayalingo noted with regret that Ghana has been 
identified 
as one of the transit points for cocaine and heroin arriving in 
Europe and North America. Mr. Ayalingo said from 1990 to 1992 
the police seized 13.76 kg of cocaine and 24.87 kg of heroin. 
According to him, figures of 1993 are not available because the 
exhibits are yet to be submitted to the Ghana Standards Board. 
  Mr. Ayalingo disclosed that another drug called crack has 
recently surfaced. He said it is an addictive form of cocaine 
prepared by combining cocaine with sodium bicarbonate, which is 
commonly called baking powder. He pointed out that it is cheap 
but very dangerous. 
  The assistant training officer of CEPS, Mr. F.K. Amusu, said 
because Ghana is being used as a transit point in the 
international narcotic trade, local consumption of heroin and 
cocaine is rising sharply. He said CEPS with its limited 
resources has been able to make a number of arrests and will 
continue to fight against illicit drug trade. 
  Miss Jessica Vapneg, a U.S. lawyer attached to the Faculty 
of 
Law, University of Ghana, Legon, said the couriers from Africa 
account for 20 to 30 percent of heroin and cocaine smuggled into 
the United States. Miss Vapneg said from 1989 to 1992, 164 
Ghanaians were arrested in the United States. 
  The vice chairman of the International Council on Alcohol 
and 
Addiction in Ghana, Mr. Noah Akolatse, appealed to NGO's 
[nongovernmental organizations], communities, and individuals to 
assist the group in their fight against drug abuse.
