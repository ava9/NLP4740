  [Text] The northern regional security committee has assured 
residents of Tamale that the military and the police are in 
control of the general security in the area and they can 
therefore go about their normal duties without fear. In a 
statement issued at Tamale, the committee requested the public 
to cooperate and warned that any person found involved in 
criminal activities would be severely dealt with. 
  The assurance came in the wake of fears generated by the 
general state of insecurity as a result of mob attacks on 
certain sections of the community since last week. The military 
and police have been deployed at strategic areas in the 
municipality to curb further acts of violence. Some 
reinforcements have also been dispatched to the East Gonja and 
Yendi Districts where fighting is reported to be still going on 
despite the call for cease-fire by the northern sector brigade 
commander of the Ghana Armed Forces. 
  According to people fleeing the fighting from Salaga, the 
casualty rate is high. In another development, Dagbon leaders 
in Tamale have formed a task force to help stop the burning and 
looting of property by irate mobs. 
  Meanwhile, a GHANA NEWS AGENCY report said that the state of 
insecurity had resulted in many people, mainly in the public 
service, leaving the municipality. Already all first and second 
cycle schools in the municipality have closed down following 
threats of mob attack. The National Mobilization Program [NMP] 
and the Red Cross Society in Tamale have, meanwhile, registered 
over 2,000 refugees who have fled the ethnic fighting in parts 
of the region. The refugees are mainly students, national 
service personnel, and displaced people, including women and 
children. The report said that about 600 of the refugees are 
camped at the Nyohene Vocational Center and are fed by the local 
community because the NMP and the Red Cross have nothing in 
stock. It said the rest of the refugees, who feel their lives 
are endangered in Tamale, are being kept in a military camp.
