  [Excerpt] The foreign minister, Dr. Obed Asamoah, has made 
strong representation to the Togolese charge d'affaires in Accra 
on the shelling of the office and residential accommodation of 
Customs, Excise, and Preventive Service, CEPS, at Aflao by 
Togolese forces following the fighting in Lome in the last 
couple of days. A statement issued by the ministry in Accra 
today said the shelling caused extensive damage to buildings and 
injured three persons who are now on admission at the Saint 
Anthony's Hospital at Dzodze. The statement said the Ghana 
Government deplores the ritual accusation by the Togolese 
authorities of Ghana for anything that goes wrong in Togo and 
advises the Togolese Government to put an end to this. It also 
demanded that the Togolese forces be restrained from indulging 
in acts of provocation which would only lead to the worsening of 
the already tense situation at the border. The statement said 
Ghana has no intention of intervening in the internal affairs of 
Togo. It said the problems of Togo are not the making of Ghana 
but are the result of the refusal of the Togolese authorities to 
implement a credible program of democratization in the country. 
  Commercial activities in the Aflao border post have come to 
a 
standstill following the closure of the Togo side of the border. 
Correspondent Rauf Avavonyor visited the border post yesterday. 
His report is read from the studio. 
  [Announcer] At the time the news team visited the border, it 
was almost empty. There was apparently a kind of war being 
waged from the Togo side against installations and buildings on 
the Ghana side of the border. Officers quarters of the CEPS and 
the Ministry of Health block had been badly damaged by a barrage 
of bullets and mortar fire from the Togo side. There are also 
reports of horrifying and indiscriminate shelling and killings. 
According to customs officials, the Togolese soldiers lined up 
12 shoe-shine boys at their side of the border and shot them. 
Yesterday, three women and a child were similarly killed and 
their bodies dumped in a vehicle and driven away. Some 
residents along the Ghana side of the border spoke of stray 
bullets landing in their homes and destroying their fittings and 
property. The CEPS officers quarters appeared to have been 
their main target. Sporadic shootings from the Togo side of the 
border could still be heard at the time of the visit. 
  At about 4 PM [1600 GMT] yesterday, the Togolese soldiers at 
the border post started another round of warning shots to drive 
away observers who had gathered at the border post. It was also 
around this time when the Volta regional minister, Mr. Modestus 
Ahiable, was being briefed on the situation by the CEPS sector 
commander, Mr. Cyril Mensah. Meanwhile, stranded passengers 
are putting up at lorry and filling stations. [passage omitted]
