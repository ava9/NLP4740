  [Text] The Government of Ghana has reaffirmed its 
determination to continue to adhere strictly to international 
law and the principle of good-neighborliness in its relations 
with Togo, but it hopes the Togolese Government will also 
reciprocate this gesture so that the people of the two countries 
can live in peace and harmony. 
  In a statement issued in Accra today, the Ministry of 
Foreign 
Affairs said, true to form, that the Government of Togo has 
begun a campaign of baseless accusations against Ghana in the 
face of a crisis that is the product of Togo's current domestic 
situation. The statement said that on 1 May, the Togolese 
foreign minister summoned Ghana's charge d'affaires in Lome to 
the Foreign Ministry to inform him that his government was in 
possession of information that a named Togolese refugee resident 
in Ghana was using other Togolese nationals to carry grenades 
and other bombs into Togo from Ghana for use in crowded 
restaurants, bars, and nightclubs normally patronized by 
foreigners. 
  According to the Togolese foreign minister, the couriers 
succeeded in smuggling the items into Togo by constantly 
outwitting both Ghanaian and Togolese security officials at the 
border. He therefore appealed to the Government of Ghana to 
restrain the named Togolese refugee and also assist in putting 
an end to such activities. No specific evidence of the alleged 
activity of the individual was however furnished to the charge 
d'affaires. 
  Before the Ghana Government could investigate the allegation 
and [words indistinct] with its stand that he was not laying any 
blame on Ghana during their first meeting. The Togolese foreign 
minister again summoned the charge d'affaires to the ministry on 
4 May to lodge a verbal protest against Ghana about a bomb that 
had allegedly gone off in a restaurant in Lome the previous day, 
wounding five French nationals and a national of Benin. The 
minister claimed that the Ghana Government had done nothing as 
earlier requested to restrain the said Togolese refugee, 
forgetting that at his first meeting with the charge d'affaires, 
he conceded that bombs had already found their way into Togo in 
circumstances in which Ghana could not be blamed. The foreign 
minister also threatened the anger of France and other foreign 
governments against Ghana. 
  The statement said in view of the gravity of the accusation, 
and the irrational and incomprehensible tradition of the 
Togolese Government of vilifying Ghana whenever convenient to 
distract attention from the consensus of its policy, the 
minister of foreign affairs, Dr. Obed Asamoah, held separate 
meetings today with the charges d'affaires of Togo and France to 
reject the protest of the Togolese Government and to warn it 
against making Ghana the scapegoat for its folly.
