  [Text] The Ghana Government has decided to review its 
participation in ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African 
States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] operations in Liberia if no 
progress is made to ensure the smooth implementation of peace 
process within one month. A statement from the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs says the government, after a thorough review of 
the Liberian situation, have expressed disappointment at the 
lack of progress toward the implementation of the Cotonou Peace 
Accord which sought to bring peace in the war-torn west African 
country.
