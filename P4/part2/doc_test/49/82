  [Text] Accra, 10 Jan (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina and Ghanaian Foreign Minister Obed Asamoah spoke today 
in favor of supporting the Nonalligned Movement (NAM) nations as 
an independent force currently facing neocolonialism in a 
unipolar world. 
  Robaina and Asamoah today held a one-hour-plus meeting 
during 
which they exchanged ideas on the world situation, and in 
particular, their respective nations. 
  The foreign minister from the Caribbean nation arrived 
yesterday in this capital as part of a two-week tour of the 
continent that also includes Angola, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and 
Namibia, in that order. 
  During their official conversations, Robaina offered an 
overall outlook on his country's economic and political 
situation, as well as the changes being implemented in the wake 
of the Soviet Union's demise and the stepping up of the blockade 
imposed on the island by the United States more than three 
decades ago. 
  In this regard, he explained that his government has opened 
doors to foreign investment under Washington's relentless 
persecution to hamper these negotiations. 
  The visitor indicated that more than 100 foreign companies 
are established on Cuban territory and one of 1994's priorities 
is to promote Latin American and Caribbean investments. 
  When referring to the conflict with the United States, the 
Cuban diplomat ruled out improved relations, although he 
remarked that as time goes by more and more sectors of U.S. 
society oppose the blockade. 
  Robaina expressed his appreciation for Ghana's position with 
regard to the Caribbean island in diverse international forums 
and particularly at the United Nations. 
  Meanwhile, Asamoah emphasized that this support, besides 
being based on friendship, is a matter of principle at a time 
when there is an attempt to force Cuba to change its political 
system. 
  We do not want the small nations to be pressured by the 
Western powers, stressed the African minister. It is very 
clear, he said, that the West tries to control the Third World 
through the UN Security Council, demonstrating the absence of 
consistency in this body. 
  To conclude, he expressed his satisfaction for being able to 
count on good friends such as Cuba. 
  The Cuban minister arrived in Accra on a two-day official 
visit accompanied by Alberto Rodriguez Arufe, coordinator of the 
Cuban Communist Party's Central Committee International 
Relations Department and by other Foreign Ministry officials. 
  During today's visit the Cuban delegation laid a wreath at 
the Kwame Nkruman monument, father of Ghana's independence. The 
wreath was received by Daniel Anam, president of the ruling 
party National Democratic Congress, and by its general secretary 
Huudu Yahaya. 
  Before travelling to Angola, Robaina met with Ghanaian 
President Jerry Rawlings. With a population of over 15 million 
people, Ghana, a former British colony, is Cuba's first trading 
partner in Africa.
