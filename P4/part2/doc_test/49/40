  [Text] The National Electoral Commission has held a meeting 
in Accra with all the registered political parties in connection 
with the provision of identity cards for Ghanaian voters. The 
political parties agreed that identity cards with thumbprint and 
special security marks should be provided for all voters 
throughout the country. However, in order to tackle the problem 
of impersonation in the big towns, photo identities will be 
provided in all the 10 regional capitals. The political parties 
also agreed that failure to raise adequate funds to undertake 
the exercise photo identities should be provided in only four 
selected urban centers. [sentence as heard]
