  [Text] A Ghanaian-born businessman has been sentenced to 24 
years in jail for his involvement in smuggling 160 million 
pounds worth of Colombian cocaine into Britain. (David Katcher), 
42, of Manchester in northern England, was convicted last July 
at a New Castle court on two charges of importing cocaine and 
[words indistinct] weighing one and a half pounds. The sentence 
was delayed so that [words indistinct] and profits made from the 
clients seized. But the court was told (Katcher) received only 
320,000 pounds out of which only 8,850 pounds was recorded. 
  (Katcher), who runs textiles and building firms and was 
exporting construction machinery to Ghana, turned to cocaine 
smuggling because of huge debts. After the cocaine and the 
first shipment in October 1991 was distributed and sold, a 
tip-off to customs officers led to the second load being 
intercepted in a wave of arrests in Togo in 1992.
