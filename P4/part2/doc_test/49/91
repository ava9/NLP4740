    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
disease reports monitored from FBIS Abidjan Bureau and EAU 
coverage areas. Source information is given in parentheses after 
each item. 
<H5>  Ghana </H5>
  Malaria -- A health official has announced at a workshop 
that 
the high incidence of malaria in the Effidua-Sekyere District is 
due to self-medication by patients and bad treatment practices 
by health personnel. According to the official, one-third of 
all diseases reported in the district last year were malaria 
cases, out of which 812 people were admitted to hospital and 21 
died. [Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in 
English 0600 GMT 2 May 94] 
  Buruli ulcer disease -- The incidence of the buruli ulcer 
disease in the Ashanti Region is now reported to have 
drastically reduced following systematic weekly and monthly 
intervention in the endemic areas by medical teams from the 
district and the regional directorate of health services during 
the past nine months. According to the Ashanti regional 
director of health services, Dr. J. K. Amofa, a total of 300 
buruli ulcer cases were recorded in eight districts in the 
region last year. This year, the number has reduced to only 56 
cases from three districts. The Amansie West District, which 
recorded the highest number of 200 cases last year, now has only 
24 recorded cases. 
  Dr. Amofa said in an interview at Tentokrom that whereas 
last 
year, a monthly average of between 40 and 50 new cases of the 
disease were reported at health institutions, this year this has 
dropped to a monthly average of between eight and 10 new cases. 
He said the medical intervention have been able to successfully 
stabilize the situation in the Kwabre, Effidua-Sekyere, and 
Atwima Districts, where no new cases have been reported. The 
only problem area now is Ashanti Akim North, where about 30 
cases have been recorded. Dr. Amofa said the early diagnosis of 
the disease and the removal of the preulcerative nodules in the 
victims through excision have contributed to the drastic 
reduction in the incidence of the disease. Between August last 
year and March this year, medical doctors removed preulcerative 
nodules from 48 victims at the Tentokrom buruli ulcer dressing 
station alone. A total of 87 ulcers were also dressed at the 
station and are in various stages of healing. [Accra Ghana
