NASA managers, facing a tight schedule, Tuesday cleared the space shuttle 
Columbia for a Dec. 18 night liftoff on a 10-day flight to launch one satellite 
and return another to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced the official launch 
target at the conclusion of a two-day flight readiness review to assess the 
status of work at launch pad 39-A to prepare the craft for its ninth flight. 
</P>
<P>
Liftoff of the eighth post-Challenger shuttle mission, the sixth of 1989, is 
scheduled for 4:29 p.m. PST, with landing set for Dec. 28 at Edwards Air Force 
Base, Calif. It will be the first American manned spaceflight spanning the 
Christmas holidays since a Skylab mission in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's flight also will mark the first from pad 39-A since before the 
Challenger disaster and the first from mobile launch platform No. 3, a firing 
stand originally built for the Apollo moon program and modified for use by the 
shuttle program.
