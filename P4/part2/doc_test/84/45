When the Iran-Contra affair began darkening the Reagan Administration's 
horizon, Ronald Reagan's advisers hoped to calm the political storm by stealing 
a page from one of the most famous presidential mea culpas in recent history: 
John F. Kennedy's apology for the Bay of Pigs debacle. 
</P>
<P>
As recounted by Reagan press secretary Larry Speakes last weekend at a UC San 
Diego symposium that featured 10 former White House spokesmen, Reagan's aides 
hoped to duplicate the manner in which Kennedy effectively defused the 1961 
controversy by firmly and immediately shouldering the blame for the botched 
Cuban invasion. 
</P>
<P>
A quick check of the historical record, however, persuaded the Reagan team that 
what had been a brilliant strategy in 1961 would be a dismal failure a quarter 
century later -- a difference owing less to distinctions between the two 
episodes than to the evolution of a markedly more adversarial relationship 
between the press and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
With Kennedy press secretary Pierre Salinger filling in details, Speakes 
recalled how Kennedy had accepted responsibility for the Bay of Pigs but 
refused to answer questions about the specifics of the incident on the grounds 
that it was "not in the national interest." Indicative of press-presidential 
relations of the period, reporters placidly accepted that explanation -- and 
Kennedy's popularity subsequently soared. 
</P>
<P>
In the intervening years, however, Vietnam and Watergate introduced "a 
flowering of contempt" to the press-presidential relationship, said Ron Nessen, 
press secretary for former President Gerald R. Ford. Well aware of reporters' 
lessened deference toward the President, Speakes said he quickly realized that 
Kennedy's public-relations approach to the Bay of Pigs "just wouldn't fly" for 
Reagan and the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
"We attempted to convince the President to say, 'I take full responsibility,' " 
Speakes said. "But we knew that in this day and age . . . we would have never 
been able to say, 'It's not in the national interest to talk anymore about it.' 
We couldn't have gotten away with what Kennedy was able to do 30 years before." 
</P>
<P>
Speakes' explanation of Reagan's handling of the Iran-Contra affair was one of 
dozens of insightful, often humorous recitations of how presidents faced 
crises, large and small, as recalled by the 10 men who served as their primary 
White House spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
During Saturday's three-hour wrap-up of the unprecedented gathering of press 
secretaries from six past administrations, stretching from Kennedy through 
Reagan, the former spokesmen discussed their successes and failures at image 
management with about a dozen professors, journalists and former White House 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
While conceding that the lessons of 1961 must be reevaluated in light of the 
dramatic changes in how the press now covers the President, Salinger argued 
that Kennedy's unflinching willingness to accept blame for a major failure 
remains a valid prototype for responses to controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"If in the first two or three days of the Watergate story, Richard Nixon had 
gone on television and said, 'I made a stupid mistake' . . . and he fired a 
couple of people, Watergate would have never happened," Salinger said. "It 
would have been a thing that would have gone away if he had accepted the 
responsibility for it." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon press secretary Ron Ziegler, however, dismissed that theory as overly 
simplistic. Nixon's response to the burgeoning controversy that grew out of the 
break-in at the Democratic national headquarters and ultimately cost him his 
office, Ziegler said, was influenced by the lingering impact of earlier or 
continuing woes such as the Pentagon Papers case and Vietnam -- in particular, 
by the considerable enmity that had developed between Nixon and the press 
because of those matters. 
</P>
<P>
Insider anecdotes from the former press secretaries yielded glimpses into 
presidential personalities certain to fascinate armchair psychologists. 
</P>
<P>
Lyndon Johnson, for example, insisted on personally approving any statement 
issued on behalf of the White House and was infuriated by premature leaks of 
Administration actions, sometimes changing planned appointments because of 
them, said Bill Moyers, one of his three White House spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
Once, Johnson, angered by a news story in which a U.S. senator had been mildly 
critical of him and searching for a proper reprisal, seized on Moyers' 
suggestion that his press secretary publicly label the senator "obstreperous." 
When the presidential rejoinder did not play well in the media, a furious 
Johnson demanded of Moyers: "Who called him obstreperous?" 
</P>
<P>
"You did!" a startled Moyers replied. To which Johnson shouted: "I can't even 
spell the goddamn word!" 
</P>
<P>
One of the more intriguing challenges that faced each of them, the press 
secretaries said, involved knowing when to take the President at his word and 
when to ignore a presidential command, often issued in the heat of the moment. 
Or, to frame the dilemma another way: What should a press secretary do when the 
President has a dumb idea? 
</P>
<P>
"We've all faced situations when you need to interpret the President," admitted 
Jody Powell, press secretary to former President Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
The consensus among the former spokesmen is that the best approach is to delay 
public action on such occasions, stalling in the hope that the President's 
anger will pass or his better judgment will return. For example, when Johnson 
instructed Moyers to fire a top aide and inform a prominent newspaper columnist 
of the dismissal, Moyers did neither. Later, when Johnson asked him what he had 
done, Moyers simply said neither man had been home when he tried to call -- and 
never heard about the matter again.
