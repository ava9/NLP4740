Some University of Southern California alumni on Monday accused a Newport-Mesa 
Unified School District board candidate of sending a last-minute campaign 
mailer that misrepresents their alma mater and wrongly implies that USC 
endorses her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
But candidate Jo Ellen Allen of Corona del Mar defended the mailer, which was 
done in the school colors of cardinal red and gold and went to hundreds of USC 
alumni living in the Newport-Mesa enrollment area of Newport Beach and Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The letters from Allen's campaign committee started arriving over the weekend. 
The letter and the envelope each bear USC's mascot Tommy Trojan and the 
notation, "Attention: USC Alumni." 
</P>
<P>
"I got it in the mail on Saturday and flipped. I was furious," said Patricia 
Hitt, a USC alumna and former assistant cabinet secretary during the Nixon 
administration. "I think it is a deliberately deceptive mailer, and this is 
what turns people off to politics." 
</P>
<P>
The correspondence tells the reader that "a good friend of ours and a fellow 
Trojan" is running for the Newport-Mesa school board. Allen, a lecturer at USC, 
is running against incumbent Sherry Loofbourrow of Corona del Mar. The letter 
describes Allen's qualifications for school board, notes that her husband 
graduated from USC and urges alumni to get behind her candidacy to ensure a 
"resounding victory this Nov. 7." 
</P>
<P>
The mailer closes with the cheer "Fight on," and is signed by builder William 
Lusk and Anita Ferguson, Allen's campaign manager and wife of state Assemblyman 
Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach). At the bottom of the letter in small print, it 
states the mailer is being paid for by the Committee to Elect Jo Ellen Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Allen denied any impropriety Monday and blamed complaints on a "lunatic fringe" 
that wants to undermine her candidacy. She pointed out that the letter contains 
a disclaimer and that there is no USC endorsement of her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever these people are, are the same people who threatened Mrs. (Anita) 
Ferguson today (Monday)," Allen said. "It is so ridiculous. People can use any 
colors they want to." 
</P>
<P>
Allen said she did not use any USC alumni lists for the mailer and declined to 
name the people who purportedly threatened her campaign manager. Ferguson could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Hitt and USC alumna Mary Lou Gray said they will complain to USC's 
administration about the Allen mailings. Gray said that she talked with USC 
authorities Monday and that they requested copies of the letter to see if there 
was anything improper. 
</P>
<P>
"I was upset because the letter gives the impression that it's a university 
mailing," said Gray, who is backing Loofbourrow. "It doesn't matter what 
candidate I'm backing. A lot of fellow Trojan alumni are outraged that Allen's 
campaign would attempt to trade on the university's name."
