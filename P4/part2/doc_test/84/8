  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
concluded a secret agreement in 1969 under which the U.S. can 
redeploy and transport nuclear weapons in Okinawa Prefecture in 
case of emergency, according to a book to be published Thursday 
[12 May]. Kei Wakaizumi, a former professor of international 
politics at Kyoto Industrial University, said in his new book 
that the two countries concluded the secret deal during summit 
talks between then Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and President 
Richard Nixon in November 1969. 
  According to the book, a draft of agreed minutes to the 
Japan-U.S. Joint Communique Nov. 21, 1969, stated in part, "In 
times of great emergency the United States Government will 
require the reentry of nuclear weapons and transit rights in 
Okinawa with prior consultation with the Government of Japan." 
  The agreed minutes also said, "The Government of Japan, 
appreciating the United States Government's requirements in 
times of great emergency as stated above by the President, will 
meet these requirements without delay when such prior 
consultation takes place." 
  As Sato's special envoy, Wakaizumi at the time was 
negotiating the reversion of Okinawa to Japanese control with 
Henry Kissinger, Nixon's national security adviser. The U.S. 
had maintained a presence of nuclear weapons in Okinawa before 
the territory was returned to Japan by the Nixon administration 
in 1972. 
  Prime Minister Sato had insisted then that Japan would 
reject 
the reentry of nuclear weapons into Okinawa even if there were 
prior consultations. 
  A government source, when asked to comment on the secret 
accord mentioned in Wakaizumi's book, said he is not aware of 
"such facts." 
  "No comment. We ignore (the report)," the source said.
