0081 0081): "With Support From China, Create U.S.-Soviet 
Equilibrium--Nixon, Mao Zedong Cooperate in Breaking Bipolar 
World"] 
  [Text] Richard Nixon's strategic insight and practice have 
rarely been seen in the contemporary world, but Nixon was also 
the only person who was forced to step down from power for 
violating the law of his own country, although he broke fresh 
ground in U.S. diplomatic strategy. Nixon's impact on 
international politics remains indelible, not because he was 
involved in the "Watergate incident," but because he opened the 
door to Sino-U.S relations. Nixon's trip to China in 1972 not 
only changed international relations at that time, but also had 
an impact on the global strategic pattern in the last three 
decades of the 20th century, and even in the 21st century. 
However, the wishful thinking of one side could not achieve 
this purpose. In other words, if there had only been Nixon's 
wish and if the Chinese leaders had not had the same intention, 
there would not have been "a week which changed the world" 
(Nixon's own words). The most developed capitalist country and 
the most populous socialist country of the East shook hands, and 
the event shocked the whole world and disrupted the bipolar 
world marked by U.S.-Soviet confrontation arranged at Yalta. 
The world was thus pushed to a multipolar pattern, and China 
became an indispensable factor in international affairs. This 
was the historical significance of Nixon's visit to China. On 
the grand stage of history, Nixon and Mao Zedong played a 
leading role together; Kissinger and Zhou Enlai also played an 
important role. 
  Nixon mounted the political stage very early. He was first 
elected as a representative in 1946, when he was only 23, and 
was elected senator four years later. He was vice president in 
the Eisenhower administration for seven years, and a member of 
the power circle. During this period, he visited more than 50 
countries, and accumulated a good deal of diplomatic experience. 
In particular, he became famous for waging the so-called 
"kitchen debate" with Khrushchev in 1958. 
  In 1968, Nixon was elected as the 37th president of the 
United States. In the late 1960's, the economic strength of 
Western Europe and Japan grew very fast, and the military 
strength of the Soviet Union was even greater. The developing 
countries also began to rise on the international stage. The 
Sino-Soviet confrontation led to a split in the communist camp. 
China possessed nuclear weapons, and its international 
influence was increasing. Within the United States, the black 
civil rights movement, the student anti-war campaign, the 
women's movement, and the new left were in the ascendant and 
formed the most powerful anti-establishment mass movement in the 
contemporary history of the United States. There was also a 
radical cultural trend signified by the appearance of hippies. 
The U.S. economy in that period was bogged down in so- called 
"stagflation," that is, high inflation and low growth appeared 
at the same time. All of this caused a famous journalist, the 
editor-in-chief of TIME, to conclude that "the `American 
century' is on the decline." 
  When Nixon became the occupant of the White House, he faced 
a 
situation in which crises and opportunities existed side by 
side. Tenacious by nature, he liked facing challenges. At that 
time, the United States faced two diplomatic and strategic 
difficulties. One was its involvement in the Vietnam war, and 
the other was the expanding power of the Soviet Union. The 
United States' involvement in the Vietnam war, like its 
involvement in the Korean War, was aimed at checking a 
nonexistent "Chinese threat," but the United States did not win 
either of these wars. Although China's strength in those days 
was much less impressive than it is today, China still 
resolutely and indomitably resisted and withstood strong 
external pressure. China did not yield to the United States, 
nor did it yield to the Soviet Union. In the West, President De 
Gaulle of France noticed this first, and France was the first 
Western country to establish diplomatic relations with China [as 
published]. In 1969, shortly after Nixon took office, he met 
with De Gaulle. The French president told Nixon: "You had 
better recognize China as soon as possible, and you should not 
recognize China after it becomes strong." Nixon was deeply 
impressed by this advice. 
  In August 1968, the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia, and 
then provoked armed conflicts with China along the Xinjiang and 
Heilongjiang frontiers. The world's attention was drawn to the 
Soviet Union's expansion and hegemonism. After studying the new 
trend, Nixon found that Soviet threats against China showed that 
the Soviet Union had become more aggressive. If the Soviet 
Union carried out "surgical operations" against China, that is, 
launched a preemptive nuclear strike against China, then the 
global balance would be upset, and this would endanger U.S. 
interests. In his memoirs, Kissinger mentioned Nixon's 
strategic change and said: This was a "revolutionary theory" and 
an "important event in the foreign policy of the United States," 
because "a President of the United States had announced that the 
survival of a major communist country was of strategic 
significance for us." 
  The above-mentioned factors show that Nixon had changed U.S. 
China policy due to many considerations, but the most important 
consideration was the long-term national interests of the United 
States. That is, he tried to use the strength of China to keep 
a balance between the United States and the Soviet Union. 
However, the move also objectively raised China's reputation in 
the international community. In particular, China was still 
embroiled in the unusual "Cultural Revolution" period. This 
event also created favorable conditions for China's later 
opening. 
  The "Cultural Revolution" was a major mistake committed by 
Mao Zedong in his later years, but this does not mean that Mao 
did not make any major contributions to the country in his later 
years. He promoted the development of Sino-U.S. relations, and 
this marks a great feat of his in the diplomatic field. His 
meeting with Nixon was one of the most important and impressive 
diplomatic events of this century. The meeting marked the 
climax of Nixon's epoch-making visit to China, and made the 
seven-day visit "a week that changed the world." 
  Mao Zedong only made two trips overseas in his life, and 
both 
were visits to the Soviet Union. However, he was not unaware of 
the outside world. Modern technology allows people to know all 
about the world without going out of their homes. Mao was a 
statesman and a military commander, but he was also a great 
strategist. He had the talent to devise strategies which 
assured victory a thousand miles away while he sat in his 
command tent. He commanded battles against the United States 
during the Korean war, the Jinmen bombardment, and the Vietnam 
war. He also said that "U.S. imperialism is only a paper 
tiger." He was a master of dialectics, and he never looked at 
things from a rigid or inflexible point of view. Mao had strong 
interest in the revolutionary history, politics, and economy of 
the United States. In late 1970, while talking with his old 
friend, Edgar Snow, Mao again mentioned the U.S. federal system, 
and he also mentioned Washington and Jefferson. Then, he talked 
about the ongoing Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks in Warsaw. Mao 
said: "I am not interested in such talks any more. Nixon also 
has no interest. There should be face-to-face talks between 
us." "If he wants to visit Beijing, you may bring a message to 
him and tell him that he can come quietly in private. He may do 
this just by getting on an airplane. He may come as a tourist 
or in his capacity as President. I do not think that I will 
quarrel with him, but I may still criticize him somewhat." 
  Snow indeed brought this message to the White House. After 
that, with Mao Zedong's personal approval and Zhou Enlai's 
concrete arrangements, the U.S. ping-pong team visited China, 
and the small ball eventually moved the globe. The American 
athletes entered China on 10 April 1971 via Hong Kong, Lo Wu, 
and Guangzhou, and then flew to Beijing. Three months later, 
Kissinger made his secret visit to Beijing.
