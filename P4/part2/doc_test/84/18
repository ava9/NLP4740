</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration on Saturday confirmed that the United States has 
discreetly shared some nuclear-weapons information with France since 1972, but 
it disputed a published report that the cooperation violated U.S. law. 
</P>
<P>
In an article published Saturday, Princeton University Prof. Richard H. Ullman 
maintains that the cooperation was a "covert" arrangement that "almost 
certainly has violated U.S. law." But he added that the arrangement has also 
strengthened the nuclear deterrent available to the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization and has helped reverse the ill effects of French President Charles 
de Gaulle's 1966 decision to pull France out of the alliance's unified military 
command. 
</P>
<P>
A statement issued jointly by the Bush White House in Rome and by the State 
Department here pointed out that the cooperation with France dates back to 
1961, when the John F. Kennedy Administration reached a formal agreement with 
France to exchange some classified information "concerning training, military 
planning, protection against nuclear-weapons effects and operation of delivery 
systems." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accord Suspended in 1966 
</P>
<P>
That agreement was suspended in 1966, after De Gaulle marched the French 
military out of NATO and ousted the alliance headquarters from Paris. But the 
arrangement was resumed in 1972, during the Richard M. Nixon Administration, 
and it was further expanded in 1985 in an amendment to the 1961 agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. statement Saturday said that the 1985 amendment allowed "exchanges of 
certain classified information related to the safety, security and reliability 
of nuclear activities and installations." 
</P>
<P>
The statement went on to insist that the relation with the French, extending 
back 28 years, "has been entirely consistent with the terms of the Atomic 
Energy Act of 1954, as amended. . . . While this cooperation has been 
confidential, it is a mistake to label it as covert (because) this cooperation 
takes place with the full knowledge of both governments and does not involve 
activities of an intelligence nature." 
</P>
<P>
In his article, in the Washington-based periodical Foreign Policy, Ullman not 
only calls the exchange covert but insists it was in violation of a 1958 
amendment to the Atomic Energy Act that, by implication, limited American 
nuclear cooperation to Britain, then the only ally with a nuclear weapons 
capability. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in his article, Ullman also concedes that after the Nixon decision to 
resume cooperation was worked out between Henry A. Kissinger, then national 
security adviser, and Michel Jobert, then French foreign minister, care was 
taken not to go beyond existing restrictions on disclosing certain types of 
information. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of the technology involved . . . has in fact been unclassified," Ullman 
writes at one point. "For the most part the exchanges have steered away from 
the actual design of nuclear weapons . . . so as not to run afoul of U.S. 
legislation. In this respect the program of assistance to France has differed 
sharply from the one with Britain, where weapons designs are routinely 
exchanged." 
</P>
<P>
What the Ullman article skirts in its assertion that laws were violated was the 
fact that President Kennedy asked Congress on Sept. 7, 1961, for unusually 
prompt action to amend the Atomic Energy Act to permit exchanges of sensitive 
information with the French. Acting under pressure after the Berlin crisis of 
that summer, Kennedy explained that the exchanges "will make possible effective 
cooperation with France in NATO mutual defense planning and in the training of 
French NATO forces." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Detailed Report 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on Saturday, a Pentagon spokesman issued a more detailed statement 
on the U.S.-French cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
The United States "has cooperated with France in improving the operational 
effectiveness and survivability of its strategic missile systems, including 
supporting command and control systems," said the spokesman, who declined to be 
identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been several meetings involving U.S. and French technicians every 
year since 1972 under the terms of the 1961 agreement," the statement from the 
Pentagon said.
