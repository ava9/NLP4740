<F P=106> [Interview with Georghe Armasu, director of the State </F>
Service for Cult Affairs, by Anatol Limanskiy; place and date 
not given: "Georghe Armasu: 'The Church Is Separate from the 
State'"] 
  [Text] President Snegur recently signed an edict on 
the establishment of the State Service for Cult Affairs. Today 
we present its director, Georghe Armasu. 
  [Armasu] I was born into an ordinary peasant family in the 
village of Tsareuk in Rezinskiy Rayon... I am Moldavian. I have 
a higher education. I left home at 14 and enrolled in the 
agricultural technical school. After that, three years in the 
army. I went through all the stages of the administrative 
structure from team leader, deputy chairman of a kolkhoz, 
secretary of the rayon party committee, to the Central Committee 
of the Communist Party of Moldova. Starting in 1984 I worked as 
the deputy to the commissioner of the Council for Religious 
Affairs of the Council of Ministers of the Union for the 
Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. After the elimination of 
this apparatus--in the secretariat of the parliament of 
Moldova... 
  [Limanskiy] For what purpose did the president establish the 
new government service? 
  [Armasu] In order not to permit unjustified interference of 
the state organs in the activity of legally recognized religious 
organizations. To strengthen control over adherence to 
legislation on cults. The new state service is a consultative 
information and expert examination organ... 
  [Limanskiy] Until recently all these questions were handled 
by a department under the Ministry of Culture. Should it have 
been eliminated? 
  [Armasu] I would put the question in a different way. Was it 
necessary to unite culture and cults? Well, since you asked--I 
will answer... 
  After all, just what is a ministry? It is a state organ that 
manages and directs institutions and industrial organizations. 
In our case, the Ministry of Culture and Cults manages not only 
institutions but the church as well. This is a violation not 
only of the Constitution of the republic, in which it is written 
that in Moldova the church is separated from the state and 
school from the church (Section 50). It is a violation of 
international acts on human rights and freedoms. The church is 
supposed to be managed by religious centers that function on the 
basis of their own regulations and statutes. 
  The question on the unification of culture and cults arose 
for the first time in May 1990 at a session of the Moldovan 
parliament. The staff of the commissioner of the Council on 
Religious Affairs tried to prevent this. Here is a quote from 
one of the documents that we sent to the leadership of the 
republic. 
  "If the state, i.e., the Ministry of Culture and Cults, 
manages religions in the SSR [Soviet Socialist Republic] of 
Moldavia... this, it seems, will be a step backward with respect 
to the times when the administrative-command system was in 
operation, or even worse--when religion in the country 
(moreover, one--Orthodoxy) was declared a state institution. In 
the final analysis, this will inevitably lead to a dispute 
between denominations, between organs of authority and religious 
organizations, and to a complication of the whole sociopolitical 
situation in the Moldavian SSR." 
  Which is what we have today. One of our main tasks is to 
correct this state of affairs. 
  [Limanskiy] Judging by everything, do you think that the 
department for cults was not entirely engaged in what was 
necessary? 
  [Armasu] I am not one of those people who claims to have the 
final word. Let the church and the public first express 
themselves in this regard. I was not acquainted with Mr. 
Kubryak, the head of the department, before he was confirmed for 
the new post. But I know that he is one of the initiators of the 
revival of the activity of the Metropolitan See of Bessarabia. 
He directed this process at the state level, openly meddled in 
the affairs of the Orthodox Church, and undermined its trust in 
the state. 
  A trust that our state service should once again win... 
  [Limanskiy] Relations between the two Orthodox communities, 
I 
will say frankly, are strained. What is the reason for the 
conflict? 
  [Armasu] There was no conflict and there is none. 
  [Limanskiy] But what is there? 
  [Armasu] At the beginning of last year a group of clergymen, 
headed by His Grace Bishop Peter of Beltsy, decided to revive 
the activity of the Bessarabian Autonomous Metropolitan See 
after a 52-year break. On 18 December 1992, together with 
deputies in parliament and representatives of the Ministry of 
Culture and Cults, they took par in a meeting of the Holy Synod 
of the Romanian Patriarchate. The synod approved a so-called 
resolution of the "eparchial meeting of 14 September 1992 on 
reviving the activity of the Bessarabian Metropolitan See under 
the jurisdiction of the Romanian Patriarchate. Bishop Peter 
became the deputy of this metropolitan see and a member of the 
Holy Romanian Synod. Such a resolution seems to me to be rather 
arguable, inasmuch as back on 5 October 1992 Peter was suspended 
in service... According to canons, another church cannot restore 
him. 
  The metropolitan see ceased its activity in 1940, and since 
that time a lot has changed. There is no Romanian kingdom, no 
Moldavian SSR, and no Chisinau eparchy, but there is the 
Moldovan Metropolitan See, whose charter was officially 
registered by the government on 3 November 1993. 
  Although our service was established recently, we have 
already started talks on the peaceful settlement of problems. We 
are now studying archival documents concerning the organization 
and activity of the Bessarabian Metropolitan See, and we are 
proposing to examine them: There is now a critical question 
concerning property, inasmuch as the churches of Bessarabia were 
at different times under the jurisdiction of three 
churches--Ecumenical, Romanian, and Russian... 
  Only it is not necessary to rush, and it is not necessary to 
urge us on. The situation has to be studied well in the 
localities, and the leadership of the republic must be kept 
reliably informed. 
  [Limanskiy] In your opinion, will the religious communities 
have any kind of influence on the course of the coming 
parliamentary elections? 
  [Armasu] The communities are already quite politicized. And 
this is what they have come to. The church is a holy place, 
where people find peace, offer prayers to God, and enrich 
themselves spiritually. The priests hear the confessions of the 
people and forgive them their sins--and everyone needs this--the 
supporters of the people's front, and the socialists, and the 
communists. 
  [Limanskiy] Well, very soon new deputies will come to power, 
really the people's representatives. Does the Law on Cults 
require any kinds of changes? 
  [Armasu] Undoubtedly. The first article requires 
considerable 
revision--it denies the right to choose and to switch to another 
faith (proselytism). Articles 14 and 15 state that for 
recognition, cults "are required to submit their charter to the 
government." Some of the provisions of the law do not comply 
with international human rights and principles. 
  I think that we will prepare additions and changes to the 
Law 
on Cults in the very near future... 
  Availing myself of this opportunity, I want through your 
newspaper to call on all believers and leaders of religious 
organizations in these difficult times to maintain tranquility, 
not engage in disputes, and resolve all questions peacefully.
