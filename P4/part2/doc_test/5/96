  [Text] The past 48 hours have been a public relations 
catastrophe for Britain in America. Gerry Adams, basking in his 
new-found legitimacy, has been guest of honour on America's most 
popular television chat shows and splashed across the front 
pages of its newspapers. Naive interviewers have lobbed him 
softball questions, permitting this master of blarney to tell 
millions of impressionable Americans how his desire for peace is 
being frustrated by the British. 
  Despite Britain's efforts to alert his interviewers to the 
complexities of Northern Ireland, none has pressed Mr Adams on, 
for example, the decades of IRA atrocities that have killed 
hundreds of innocent civilians. John Alderdice, leader of the 
Alliance party, did manage an on-air telephone call to Larry 
King Live to counter the spiel of a man Mr King addressed 
throughout as "Gerry," but ABC's Good Morning America refused to 
let him take part. 
  "It's a propaganda triumph for Adams," groaned one British 
official. "It's set back a true understanding of Northern 
Ireland in America by 10 or 15 years." The British warned the 
Clinton Administration that this would happen, and one or two 
U.S. officials yesterday expressed dismay at Mr Adams's coup. 
The chat-show hosts may have been naive, but not half as bad as 
those in the White House who believed they could limit the Sinn 
Fein leaders exposure by restricting him to a 25-mile radius of 
Manhattan. 
  The British Government argued forcefully that it would be 
quite wrong for the Administration to reward Mr Adams before he 
had made a single genuine concession, and this was accepted by 
the State and Justice Departments, House Speaker Thomas Foley 
and the FBI, which has spent years combating Irish and other 
terrorists. 
  Indeed, Sunday's White House statement announcing Mr Adams's 
admittance was a model of disinformation. It said Janet Reno, 
the Attorney General, had issued the order on the recommendation 
of Warren Christopher, the Secretary of State -- the clear 
suggestion being that these two senior cabinet secretaries 
supported the President's decision. In fact, the White House 
leaked it before Miss Reno had even been told. 
  By this time, even Sir Robin Renwick, the British ambassador 
and a formidable behind-the-scenes operator, was unable to save 
the situation. After a day of deliberation on Saturday, Mr 
Clinton took a decision which reversed a 20-year American policy 
and can be construed only as a slap in the face for America's 
closest ally. He did so on the recommendation of the National 
Security Council, which argued that now was the time to offer Mr 
Adams a carrot, and under intense political pressure from a 
galvanised Irish-American lobby. 
  Mr Clinton must also have known that his decision would be 
seen as a rebuff to Britain and a propaganda victory for the 
IRA. It would be going too far to suggest this was his revenge 
for the Conservatives' support of President Bush in the 1992 
campaign, but the inescapable conclusion is that he cares less 
about Washington's relations with London than his predecessors. 
  The international relationships he most values are those 
based on trade, not security, and on that score Britain rates 
well below China, Japan and Germany. 
  But what really preoccupies Mr Clinton is domestic politics. 
He had fences to mend with the powerful Irish-American lobby, 
having last year backpedalled on his election promises to admit 
Mr Adams and appoint a special envoy to Northern Ireland. The 
pressure on him was spearheaded by Edward Kennedy and Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, chairmen respectively of the Senate labour and 
finance committees, whose support for Mr Clinton's health-care 
reform is critical. They were backed by 12 other senators and 
27 congressmen, almost all Democrats from areas with sizeable 
Irish communities. Thirty-two of them face re-election this 
November. 
  Earlier this month, these congressmen all signed a letter 
urging Mr Clinton to "facilitate the emerging dialogue as an 
alternative to violence," and they sustained the pressure up to 
the moment the decision was taken. They argued that a 
concession to Mr Adams might strengthen his influence over IRA 
hardliners opposed to the joint declaration, and that the 
British Government had itself had recent contacts with Sinn Fein 
and the IRA. 
  Early last week, British officials thought Mr Adams would 
not 
be admitted. They were not unduly alarmed even when the 
Administration announced last Thursday that it is ordering its 
Belfast diplomats to elicit Mr Adams's views on terrorism and 
the Anglo-lrish peace initiative. They believed they had 
reached an understanding that Mr Adams would only be let in if 
he unequivocally renounced violence and supported the joint 
declaration. What no one anticipated was that the White House 
would instead interpret Mr Adams's weasel words as "constructive 
comments warranting a visa." 
  John Major visits Washington later this month. He will 
undoubtedly play down this unhappy episode. But there seems 
little chance of the Prime Minister and Mr Clinton sitting down 
in a Washington restaurant, as the President did with Germany's 
Helmut Kohl this week, and jovially gobbling their way through a 
hefty lunch like the best of friends.
