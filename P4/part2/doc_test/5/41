Although the visibility of so-called destructive cults may have dimmed from 
media attention somewhat, many of these groups are every bit as active now as 
they were 10 to 15 years ago. And, according to this encyclopedic reference 
book, families, social service agencies, religious leaders -- as well as 
would-be joiners and ex-cult members -- urgently need to understand the 
dynamics of cults in American society. 
</P>
<P>
The volume, dedicated to Maynard Bernstein, the late Los Angeles cult educator, 
is an anthology of previously published articles and excerpts plus some 
original contributions. They were written by people who have viewed the 
multifaceted cult scene from a variety of perspectives: psychiatrists, 
psychologists, educators, lawyers, former members, parents, and deprogrammers 
and "exit" counselors. 
</P>
<P>
The editors note that perhaps as much as 12% of U.S. cult membership is Jewish, 
though only 3% of the American population identifies with Judaism. Yet, while a 
Jewish perspective shapes the book, it steers away from sectarianism. Material, 
for example, by evangelical Christian sociologist Ron Enroth of Westmont 
College is included, and the book's observations and insights should prove 
valuable to people of any -- or no -- religious background. 
</P>
<P>
"Our disagreement with cults does not focus on the content of their beliefs," 
the editors say early on. "Rather, we are concerned with what is, in our 
opinion, deceptive proselytizing and unethical conduct. . . . We are also 
concerned about the political activities of these organizations." 
</P>
<P>
"Cults &amp; Consequences" explores a panoply of topics: defining "cults" and 
what makes some destructive; how and why people become involved in cults; how 
cult recruiters operate and how indoctrination takes place; various ways 
members leave cults and why some stay out while others return; the role and 
perspective of parents, and legal issues in deprogramming and child custody 
when parents split over cult involvement. 
</P>
<P>
The approach is not glib: The work both recognizes and wrestles with the fact 
that there often are perceived benefits to cult membership and that complex 
moral and psychological "shades of gray" are involved. 
</P>
<P>
For example, exit counselor Steve Hassan, a former member of the Unification 
("Moonie") Church, says he finds it "particularly hard . . . to use a deceptive 
technique like the one many cults use to recruit, even though it is temporary 
and used for the purpose of helping people to regain autonomy. . . . My choice 
is based on the lesser of the evils. I would rather misrepresent myself than to 
encourage the use of forced interventions or do 'nothing.' " 
</P>
<P>
Readers will find the concluding section on resources and references especially 
helpful. Dozens of cult awareness and exit assistance organizations are 
included. The list of books and articles is much more limited. But co-editor 
Andres, who is director of the Commission on Cults and Missionaries for the 
Jewish Federation Council of Los Angeles, asks readers to send her "any and 
all" cult-related material for future reference. 
</P>
<P>
The book has some annoying glitches, such as occasionally not identifying the 
beginning or ending of excerpted materials, omitting items from the table of 
contents, inappropriately indenting passages, incorrectly breaking lines and 
pages, and typos. Patches of dull writing could be livened up considerably with 
a little astute editing. 
</P>
<P>
More serious is the book's patchwork-quilt format, which makes for uneven 
quality and considerable repetition. 
</P>
<P>
The book would be easier (and quicker) to read and more riveting if Andres and 
Lane had decided to be authors instead of editors, assimilating and quoting 
from their abundant materials and excellent sources but writing their own 
manuscript. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the format is not without strengths. Most chapters conclude 
with a useful study guide with questions for both group and individual use. 
Some are provocative: "If your salvation could only be achieved by getting 
other people to join with you, would you lie to get them to join?" And: "Where 
do you think the line is drawn between non-coercive and coercive exit 
counseling?" 
</P>
<P>
The frequent use of summaries, and lists of questions or points set off in 
boldface print or ruled boxes, make it easy to find specifics and skip over 
material not all readers will need, such as legal technicalities. 
</P>
<P>
The handbook was designed to help a broad range of professionals as well as the 
general public; it will provide all a comprehensive and objective overview of 
cults and a gold mine of thoughtful answers and tested, practical suggestions 
for action. 
</P>
<P>
Some may feel disappointed not to find more definitive information about 
specific cult groups -- by name -- telling how to combat them individually. The 
editorial decision not to do that was no doubt influenced by fear of hostile 
cult litigation, which, in fact, long held up the book's publication. 
</P>
<P>
That the editors and publisher of "Cults &amp; Consequences" weren't finally 
intimidated is itself laudable; that there was pressure to suppress the book 
underlines how much it is needed.
