After two decades of searching, government researchers have finally identified 
the specific site on the surface of brain cells where marijuana binds to induce 
its mood-altering effects. 
</P>
<P>
Identification of this so-called cannabinoid receptor, reported today in the 
British journal Nature, should provide a major step forward for researchers who 
are trying to produce drugs that have the positive medical effects of marijuana 
without its accompanying intoxicated feeling, disorientation and impaired 
perception and memory. 
</P>
<P>
Marijuana has been found to have therapeutic effects on epilepsy, glaucoma, 
asthma, nausea, pain and hypertension. It is now used to only a limited extent 
in treating nausea in cancer patients, however, because of both the moral 
issues associated with its mood-altering effects and the severe restrictions 
the government has placed on the growth and sale of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
The existence of a receptor means that the brain almost certainly produces its 
own chemicals, similar to those found in marijuana, that are used in 
communication between brain cells. Moreover, the location of the cells involved 
suggests the chemicals may be involved in memory and intelligence, as well as 
having therapeutic properties. 
</P>
<P>
"The receptor's not there just so people can go out and smoke pot and get 
high," said pharmacologist Tom I. Bonner of the National Institute of Mental 
Health in Bethesda, Md., a co-author of the paper. 
</P>
<P>
Those naturally occurring compounds or synthetically produced derivatives could 
be the foundation of a whole new family of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The identification of the cannabinoid receptor should "vastly accelerate drug 
development, fulfilling the . . . promise of marijuana as medicine," said 
neuroscientist Solomon H. Snyder of the Johns Hopkins University School of 
Medicine. "I'd say it's one of the most important discoveries in marijuana 
research." 
</P>
<P>
Pharmacologist Lisa A. Matsuda and her colleagues at the institute sifted 
through genetic material in the brain cells of rats until they found a gene 
that looked like a good candidate for the cannabinoid receptor. 
</P>
<P>
They then inserted the gene into cells from the ovaries of Chinese hamsters. 
These cells, which are widely used in research, do not normally respond to 
marijuana. But when Matsuda exposed the genetically altered cells to 
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the primary ingredient of marijuana, they 
exhibited a biochemical response that could only have been stimulated by the 
receptor. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Nature paper reports only on the rat brain receptor, Matsuda said 
in an interview that her group has found a similar gene in human brain tissues. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers also determined where in the rat brains the receptor was being 
produced. They found that is was most common in the cerebral cortex, which is 
the seat of all conscious sensations and actions, memory, will and 
intelligence. The concentration of cannabinoid receptors is also high in the 
hippocampus, which plays a crucial role in short-term memory. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to new forms of disease therapy, identification of the cannabinoid 
receptor could lead to development of new compounds to ease the craving of 
people who have become habituated to marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Matsuda also speculated that some mental disorders whose causes are currently 
unknown may be the result of defects in the cannabinoid receptor. Because of 
the discovery of the receptor, she concluded, "we can learn a lot more about 
how the brain works." 
</P>
<P>
The discovery also provides a definitive solution to a dispute that has been 
roiling the drug abuse research community for years. 
</P>
<P>
Many researchers did not believe that a cannabinoid receptor actually existed. 
Because delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol is a molecule that dissolves readily in 
fats, researchers long assumed that it exerted its effects by dissolving in the 
membrane of brain cells and disrupting normal activities. 
</P>
<P>
That is the mechanism, for example, by which most anesthetics work. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Allyn C. Howlett, a pharmacologist at the St. Louis University 
School of Medicine, reported experiments that strongly indicated that a 
cannabinoid receptor did exist and that predicted many of its properties. The 
work suggested that the receptor was found primarily in parts of the brain 
involved in thought, learning and memory. 
</P>
<P>
"Her work . . . was probably not accepted by a large group of people because of 
a lot of evidence that argued against a receptor theory," Matsuda said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our results show that there is a gene present that produces the protein that 
she described," thereby confirming Howlett's work and vindicating her 
arguments, Matsuda said. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Wednesday, Howlett said that she and her colleagues 
have isolated a chemical that they believe is the brain's naturally occurring 
cannabinoid, but that the work is too preliminary to discuss.

Drawing, MARIJUANA'S EFFECT ON THE BRAIN: To produce its mood-altering and 
therapeutic effects, the primary ingredient of marijuana, 
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, binds to a receptor on the surface of cells in 
the same manner that a key fits into a lock. The binding triggers activity 
within the cell. The receptors are found in the highest concentration in two 
major areas of the brain. The cerebral cortex is the seat of all conscious 
sensations and actions, memory, the will, and intelligence. The hippocampus 
plays a crucial role in short-term memory. Los Angeles Times
