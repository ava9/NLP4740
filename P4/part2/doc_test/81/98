  [Text] Doha, 3 May (AFP)--Israeli and Arab negotiators 
clashed here Tuesday [3 May] on the first day of talks on Middle 
East disarmament aimed at halting the spiralling billion-dollar 
arms race in the region. 
  More than 40 states, including Israel and most Arab 
countries, were taking part in three days of multilateral 
discussions behind closed doors on a draft arms limitation deal 
for the region. 
  But trouble flared almost immediately as the Arab and 
Israeli 
delegations differed over how the talks should proceed, 
officials said. 
  A Western delegate said the head of the Israeli delegation, 
defence ministry director-general David Ivry, insisted "straight 
away that the session should adopt the draft, provoking Arab 
reticence." 
  An Arab delegate said: "Certain Arab participants, including 
Saudi Arabia, saw the proposed text as a political statement 
which has nothing to do with arms limitation." 
  The text specifies that arms limitation "must in no way come 
at the expense of one nation or provide advantages to another," 
and it must be approved "with the unanimous support of all 
parties concerned." 
  Under the terms of the 1991 Madrid peace conference which 
launched the disarmament talks, the draft declaration of 
principles on disarmament also includes a reference to "a 
reduction in the arsenals and personnel of the armed forces" in 
the region. 
  And it stresses that the Middle East should become an area 
where "weapons of mass destruction will be eliminated." 
  UN and EU envoys, as well as representatives of the United 
States and Russia, the co-sponsors of the Middle East peace 
process, were also attending the conference in the Qatari 
capital, held under tight security. 
  A Western delegate said: "The Arabs believe we must first 
agree on the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, while 
the Israelis insist the priority is to establish 
confidence-building measures in the region." 
  The Arab countries first want Israel to agree to practical 
measures on arms control, which should cover Israel's nuclear 
weapons capability. 
  Israel has vehemently denied that it possesses nuclear 
weapons, but Western experts have estimated it probably has up 
to 200 warheads. 
  "The fact that a state in the region possesses a nuclear 
strength perpetuates tension," said Qatari Foreign Minister 
Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabbur Al Thani. 
  He urged Israel to submit its nuclear potential to 
international supervision, and called on it to sign the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  "Political stability in the region depends on an arms 
balance 
between Israel and the Arabs," Al Thani said. 
  A Western delegate said Israel "considers its technological 
superiority in defence matters is designed to ensure a balance 
in the region, as the Arabs have such great advantages in terms 
of population and territory." 
  In a bid to narrow Arab-Israeli differences, Western 
countries have proposed setting up collective structures 
including a crisis prevention centre to improve understanding 
and promote cooperation, a delegate said. 
  Russia has also suggested opening a regional military data 
bank "to exchange information on the state and position of 
forces and military manoeuvres in the region," another delegate 
said. 
  Ivry is heading a 21-strong team, the first to visit Qatar 
since the creation of Israel in 1948. 
  Informal talks between Arab countries and other participants 
are due to be held Wednesday on the sidelines of the main 
meeting.
