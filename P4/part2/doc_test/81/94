<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "King Husayn's Successful Visits </F>
to the Sultanate of Oman, Qatar"] 
  [Text] The successful visits His Majesty King Husayn made 
to the Sultanate of Oman and to Qatar, and his meetings with 
Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id and His Highness Shaykh Khalifah 
Bin-Hamad Al Thani have been the culmination of his majesty's 
continuous efforts to restore cohesion to the Arab ranks in 
order to confront the dangerous stage through which our nation 
is passing. 
  Jordan, Oman, and Qatar have identical positions on Arab 
solidarity, joint Arab action, and the need to begin a new Arab 
stage that overcomes the negative elements of the past and takes 
into consideration the Arab nation's interest and future. 
However, some Arab positions are still hostage to these 
negative elements and fail to overcome them. Furthermore, these 
positions adhere to weak arguments and advance stands that are 
based on deceptive imaginations and facts which aim to implement 
the biggest conspiracy that targeted Iraq and the Arab nation as 
a whole in what was called the Gulf crisis. 
  His majesty the king's statements to the Qatari media and 
Jordanian journalists reflect Jordan's firm and principled 
commitment to the higher pan-Arab interests and eagerness to 
maintain the minimum joint Arab action. The statements also 
demonstrate the efforts with sincere brothers to overcome the 
disaster and to start laying down new bases for Arab solidarity, 
based on mutual respect, eagerness to maintain the nation's 
rights and interests, and coordination of positions on peace 
negotiations, the status of Jerusalem, and support for the 
steadfastness of the kinsfolk in the occupied territories in 
face of occupation and in their just struggle to restore their 
legitimate rights, led by restoration of occupied Palestinian 
territories and the right to self-determination. 
  Undoubtedly, His Majesty King Husayn's emphasis on the 
status 
of Jerusalem as part of the occupied territories, as stipulated 
in all international resolutions, and on linking the fate of the 
holy city to the current Arab situation is a renewed call on 
Arab leaders to meet, have frank discussion, evaluate what 
happened so far in peace negotiations, and coordinate Arab 
positions on Jerusalem in particular, and the Arab causes in 
general.
