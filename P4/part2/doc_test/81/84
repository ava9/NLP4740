  [Text] Cuban Foreign Relations Minister Roberto Robaina has 
arrived in Qatar for an official three-day visit by invitation 
of that country's foreign affairs ministry. He was greeted at 
the capital city airport by Ahmad bin Muhammad Ali al-Subayi, 
the minister of electricity and water resources. 
  In reply to questions by the local media, Robaina said Cuba 
is interested in developing ties with Qatar and other gulf 
states. In this regard, he recalled the recent establishment of 
diplomatic ties with Oman and added that there is political will 
to do the same with other countries of the region. 
  In less than 48 hours, the Cuban foreign minister will 
complete a busy schedule that includes meetings with Chief of 
State Amir Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani; the crown prince; and the 
ministers of foreign affairs, health, and economy and finance. 
  Robaina traveled to Qatar from Cairo where he attended the 
Nonaligned countries' ministerial meeting.
