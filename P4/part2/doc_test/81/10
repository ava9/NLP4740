  [Excerpts] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
the Yemeni Presidential Council chairman, arrived in Doha 
Airport at 1230 today on a visit to the sisterly State of Qatar. 
  His Highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, amir of the 
State of Qatar, led those who received brother President Salih. 
[passage omitted on reception ceremony] 
  President Salih made a statement to the press in which he 
said: I am pleased to visit the sisterly State of Qatar and to 
meet with my brother His Highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al 
Thani, amir of Qatar. 
  During this visit, we will discuss several issues that 
concern our warm fraternal relations and the spheres of 
cooperation between our two sisterly countries. I am satisfied 
with the continuous progress in these relations, which reflects 
the aspirations of the two fraternal peoples. Discussions will 
also deal with regional developments and issues that concern the 
region and the Arab nation. 
  During this visit, I will brief my brother Shaykh Khalifah 
on 
developments in our country and the efforts made to overcome the 
political crisis that is endangering unity and stability in our 
country. We appreciate the efforts the brothers are making 
toward bolstering Yemeni unity in its capacity as a pan-Arab 
achievement that should be preserved in order to entrench peace 
and stability in the region. 
  I express the appreciation of our country -- its leadership, 
government, and people -- for our brothers in Qatar, led by His 
Highness Shaykh Khalifah, for their fraternal positions toward 
our country, and their pan-Arab eagerness to safeguard the 
Yemeni unity. 
  We appreciate the Qatari brothers' support for development 
in 
Yemen, which is something that demonstrates the depth of warm 
fraternal bilateral relations. [passage omitted]
