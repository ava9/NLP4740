  [Text] The Jordanian side, led by Talal al-Hasan, minister 
of state for foreign affairs, and the Qatari side, led by His 
Excellency Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabr Al Thani, Qatari 
foreign minister, held a round of talks this evening. 
  They reviewed the fraternal and distinguished bilateral 
relations between the two fraternal countries and peoples, 
established by His Majesty King Husayn and his brother His 
Highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, amir of the State 
of Qatar. 
  The two sides emphasized the importance of developing and 
fostering bilateral cooperation in all fields, and agreed to 
form a joint committee headed by minister of state for foreign 
affairs and the Qatari foreign minister to activate and follow 
up the development of bilateral relations in various fields in 
light of His Highness Crown Prince Hasan's visit to Qatar last 
August, and the subsequent exchange of visits by ranking 
officials of both countries. The joint committee will meet 
alternately in the capitals of the two countries. It was agreed 
that the first meeting will be held in the Qatari capital in the 
first quarter of this year. 
  The meeting reviewed details of various bilateral agreements 
and executive programs in the fields of cultural cooperation, 
manpower, vocational training, exchange of expertise, health, 
environment, press exchange as well as exchange of programs and 
news dispatches, transportation and airfreight, and gas. 
  Special emphasis was placed on the exchange of visits 
between 
the chambers of commerce of the two countries and the private 
sector, facilitating the travel of businessmen to the two 
countries, and encouraging investment and cooperation in the 
banking field. 
  Reviewing Arab developments, the two sides emphasized the 
importance of bolstering solidarity and the unity of Arab ranks 
in a manner that preserves the Arab nation's interests and 
realizes its objectives. 
  Al-Hasan explained the developments of the peace process, 
and 
emphasized Jordan's firm commitment to this process, both in its 
bilateral and multilateral talks, in accordance with the 
constants and principles on which the peace process was 
established. These constants and principles are the 
implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the 
exchange of land for peace, the Palestinian legitimate rights on 
the Palestinian national soil, restoration of Arab rights in 
land and water, a solution to the problems of the refugees and 
displaced persons in accordance with the resolutions of 
international legitimacy, and full Israeli withdrawal from the 
occupied Arab territories, including holy Jerusalem. He 
emphasized that Jordan is committed to a comprehensive solution 
on all tracks with the aim of reaching a just, comprehensive, 
and lasting peace in the region. 
  The minister summed up the economic difficulties and 
challenges Jordan is facing, and referred to the blockade 
imposed on al-'Aqabah port and the subsequent losses to the 
Jordanian economy. He also explained the democratic march in 
Jordan and the recent parliamentary elections. 
  The guest minister expressed gratitude and appreciation for 
the warm reception he and his delegation were accorded, and 
emphasized the depth of fraternal bilateral relations, and the 
eagerness of the State of Qatar to bolster and develop these 
relations within the framework of bolstering Arab solidarity. 
The minister hailed Jordan's role in the peace process and 
emphasized his country's support for the peace process in a 
manner that secures restoration of Arab rights and the 
legitimate rights of the Palestinian people on their national 
soil, in accordance with the resolutions of international 
legitimacy and the principles on which the peace process was set 
up. 
  The two sides reviewed a number of Arab, regional, and 
international issues of mutual concern, and exchanged views on 
them. 
  The meeting was attended by the delegation accompanying the 
guest minister, secretaries general of the Foreign Ministry and 
Industry and Commerce Ministry, the Jordanian ambassador to 
Qatar, Qatari ambassador in Amman, and a number of Foreign 
Ministry officials.
