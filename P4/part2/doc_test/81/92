  [Text] Muscat, April 4 (AFP)--Yemen's rival leaders, 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, failed to settle their political dispute during talks in 
Salalah south of here, an Omani government official said Monday. 
  "It appears the two sides have still not reached agreement, 
especially on military matters," Omani Minister of State for 
Foreign Affairs Yusuf Bin-Alawi Bin-'Abdallah [name as received] 
told reporters. 
  Salih and al-Bid met on Sunday in the Omani city of Salalah 
-- their first meeting since they signed a reconciliation accord 
in Amman on February 20 calling for widespread reforms. 
  Omani television showed the northern and southern leaders, 
who have been embroiled in a dispute since last August over the 
running of their country, embracing and relaxing at a dinner 
hosted by Sultan Qabus. 
  Bin-'Abdallah said Oman may pull out of a commission set up 
jointly with Jordan to try to implement the military clauses of 
the reconciliation accord. 
  North and South Yemen were united in May 1990 but their 
armies have not been merged and the south has called for 
decentralization. 
  The accord said the opposing armies should be redeployed and 
military checkpoints removed from certain areas. 
  At least 20 people were killed in clashes which broke out 
soon after it was signed. 
  Bin-'Abdallah said Oman would have to consult with Jordan, 
"to halt our involvement in the military commission, because it 
can no longer fulfill its role." 
  The commission could not function "without any political 
progress," he said. 
  "The Yemenis must make efforts themselves, the party leaders 
must resolve the difficulties and make concessions for there to 
be political progress." 
  The minister said the military commission's work was 
obstructed by divisions between the three ruling parties in 
Yemen's coalition government. 
  Salih heads the General People's Congress, while al-Bid is 
leader of the Aden-based Yemen Socialist Party, which ruled 
former Marxist South Yemen. The third party is parliamentary 
speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar's Muslim militant movement 
Al-Islah. 
  Al-Bid has refused to take up his duties in Sanaa since the 
dispute erupted. 
  Salih arrived in Doha Monday for his first visit to Qatar 
since the January-February 1991 Gulf war. 
  He was met at the airport by the Amir of Qatar, Shaykh 
Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al-Thani. 
  Relations between the two countries soured over Yemen's 
pro-Iraqi stance during the Gulf crisis which followed the 
August 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
  Al-Bid left Oman for Aden Monday, the official Omani news 
agency said. 
  More than 40 deputies began a sit-in at the Yemeni 
parliament 
in Sanaa Monday after it was announced that the talks in Oman 
had failed. 
  A participant said the protest was "against any split or 
attempt to undermine unity" in the country. 
  Other deputies were due to join the sit-in later Monday, he 
said.
