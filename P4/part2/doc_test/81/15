<F P=106> [Report on "first ever" interview given to Israeli media </F>
with Foreign Minister al-Thani by unidentified correspondents in 
Doha on 3 May] 
  [Text] The Qatari foreign minister said today that he sees 
no problem with Qatar establishing diplomatic relations with 
Israel, but this must come after peace is established throughout 
the Middle East. He made the remark a few minutes ago in a 
conversation with Israeli reporters in Doha, upon the opening of 
the multinational talks on arms control. Our correspondent in 
Qatar Netan'el Semrik is on the telephone line from Qatar with 
the gist of the first-ever interview a Qatari foreign minister 
gave the Israeli media: 
  [Semrik] Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabbur al-Thani, the 
Foreign Affairs Minister of the Qatari Emirate, smiled at the 
Israeli cameras and told the Israeli microphones that in 
principle he does not oppose visiting Israel. Everything 
depends on the pace of the progress of the talks on all the 
other tracks, he said. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Thani, in English] Well, I cannot 
answer this question but if everything goes well in all the 
peace process on the Syrian and the Lebanese tracks, then I do 
not see there is any problem. 
  [Unidentified correspondent, in English] Would you like to 
invite the Israeli prime minister here to Qatar? 
  [Al-Thani, laughing, in English] Thank you very much. [end 
recording] 
  [Semrik] The minister said he cannot answer the question on 
whether he would like to visit Israel, but he has no problem in 
doing so, provided the talks on the Israeli-Syrian-Lebanese 
tracks make proper progress.
