  [Text] Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived in Qatar 
early today. Robaina and his delegation had previously 
participated in the ministerial summit of the Nonaligned 
Movement. 
  Robaina was greeted by Qatari Minister [passage indistinct] 
and Cuban Ambassador Orlando Requena. Robaina told local 
reporters that the Cuban Government is interested in developing 
ties with Qatar and other Gulf states and that to this end, 
diplomatic ties were recently established with Oman and that 
there is the political will to do likewise with the rest of the 
countries in the region. Robaina added that another goal of the 
trip is to study ways to develop bilateral trade in connection 
with the results of the trip to Cuba by Qatari businessmen. 
  In 48 hours, Robaina will fulfill a busy agenda including 
meetings with Qatar's head of state, Amir Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al 
Thani, and the ministers of foreign affairs, health, and economy 
and finance. Robaina will also tour the Umm Sa'id industrial 
complex and the petrochemical and steel plants. This occasion 
will also serve to officially inaugurate the Cuban Embassy. 
  Three months ago, Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad Bin-Jasim 
Bin-Jabur Al Thani visited Cuba and since then, Qatari 
delegations have gone Cuba to inquire about cooperation in 
sports, health, and tourism.
