    [Editorial Report] Beirut AL-ANWAR in Arabic on 6 May on 
pages 1 and 15 carries a 700-word report which includes the 
"text" of a letter allegedly sent to Qatari Amir Khalifah 
Bin-Hamad Al Thani by his brother Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Hamad Al 
Thani, a former education minister. The letter urges the 
dismissal of Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad Bin-Jasim Al Thani 
for his "irresponsible" policies. 
  The letter points to the "negative consequences" of the 
foreign minister's meeting with his Israeli counterpart and to 
the continuing Arab media criticism of the "sudden change" in 
Qatar's foreign policy, "which has always been known for its 
courageous support for Arab causes in general and the 
Palestinian cause in particular." 
  Noting in his letter that the amir "always has concern for 
the higher interests of the country and the national interests 
of the Arab and Islamic nation," Shaykh Al Thani says: "With his 
reckless statements and irresponsible acts that demonstrate 
great vanity and arrogance, the foreign minister has destroyed 
Qatar's foreign policy and been a dismal failure, for which he 
deserves questioning and dismissal." The letter also accuses 
the minister of destroying the domestic economy as he worked "to 
serve his personal interests, disregarding the nation's economic 
interests." 
  The report goes on to say the letter, "which reveals a 
serious split in the royal family" is the second of its kind 
since the beginning of the year. It was distributed among some 
circles in Qatar and the other Gulf Cooperation Council 
countries when the country was hosting the multilateral talks on 
Middle East disarmament on 2-3 May, in which Israel 
participated. It says the first letter, in which Shaykh Al 
Thani "condemned the foreign minister's meetings with Israeli 
ministers and officials at the United Nations and in London," 
was sent to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and to Arab and 
foreign embassies in Doha.
