from strong telecommunications infrastructure to low wage rates - but there
is possibly nothing as alluring as feeling wanted.
A location's receptivity to new investors is the key in site shopping. While
human warmth can weigh in, this is commonly measured in the kind of
incentives offered to investors.
'The incentive issue has increased in importance,' says Mr Robert Farley,
partner at Chicago-based PHH Fantus, the largest US firm specialising in
relocation. 'There's a far higher number of companies that want to know at
the beginning what state and local incentives programmes are.'
Although a subject of debate, many companies will not even consider
locations that do not at a minimum offer tax abatements.
Companies are also more and more often seeking incentives that can solve a
particular problem, whether it be road building or money upfront for
research grants at local universities.
The US Sunbelt, already blessed with many desirable features, has been
singularly competitive on incentives - with stunning results. The
Greenville-Spartanburg area of western South Carolina, for example, has
attracted more foreign investment per capita than any other US metropolitan
area. And Atlanta, known for its ability to market itself effectively, has
consistently been ranked as the top choice of both US and foreign corporate
executives.
In its 1993 national real estate survey, Ernst &amp; Young, the accounting and
consultancy firm, found that of the top 10 markets, six were in the
south-east or south-west, with Washington-Baltimore, Seattle, Chicago and
Denver also making the list. Atlanta was ranked as the top relocation spot
by 1,700 US real estate executives who were polled.
Louis Harris, the US polling expert, also recently conducted a survey of
senior executives from 540 companies in seven countries, including the UK,
Germany, France, Italy, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. They also named six
Sunbelt sites as the best locations for new plants or offices, and again
their top choice was Atlanta.
Mr Wesley Devoto, an Atlanta-based 'finder', who identifies acquisitions for
UK companies (like an investment banker without the financial role), says:
'Almost all the British companies I've dealt with over the past 15 years
would like to have a headquarters in Atlanta.'
The Sunbelt's cheaper properties, lower wage rates, lack of unionisation and
more modest cost of living overall make these states some of the most
attractive places to locate a plant, distribution centre or corporate
headquarters.
The average manufacturing wages rates in the south-east, Dollars 9.85 an
hour, and the mid-south, Dollars 10.18 an hour, are still relative bargains
compared to the rest of the nation. The national average is Dollars 11.45.
Part of the explanation for the disparity is that unions have long been
anathema in the south. Many southern states have right-to-work laws which
have the effect of barring unionisation. While potential investors are
usually treated like princes, those that would bring unions with them can be
snubbed.
Management salaries in the south are often lower, too, because the cost of
living is lower. According to Runzheimer International, which tracks the US
cost of living, a family of four can live well in Memphis for about Dollars
55,800 a year, whereas the same family would have to pay almost Dollars
76,000 for the same amenities in Los Angeles.
But other cities and states have been eager to court business investment as
well. Some have chosen to target certain industries, while not excluding
others. Oklahoma City wants to be known as America's capital of 'back
office' operations. Boulder, Colorado, has been attracting biotechnology
firms. Columbus, Ohio, has been expanding its financial and insurance
sector.
US managerial talent and highly skilled labour are at present abundantly
available and often willing to go where the jobs are. According to real
estate consultants Cushman &amp; Wakefield, more than 640,000 white collar jobs
were lost in the United States during the 1990-1991 recession and the
continued consolidations and downsizings of major American firms promise
that the talent pool will remain large.
Most states also offer some type of worker training scheme.
With respect to the American property market, stability is beginning to set
in after rampant overbuilding in the late 1980s. Vacancy rates in many major
cities are dropping and this can mean that prices will firm up in many
locations as top quality space is absorbed.
Yet, the traditional 'hard' factors of site selection - wages, real estate
costs, taxes - are in many cases yielding to more 'soft' factors, such as
the quality of life offered by a certain location.
More and more, especially for corporate headquarters, companies are looking
at housing prices, quality of schools, cultural and recreational amenities,
and environmental appeal. The rolling green hills of central Alabama, for
example, felt inviting to Mercedes-Benz officials because they were reminded
of Stuttgart.
In addition, many foreign investors prefer an area where they will find
other compatriots. Atlanta, for instance, has the largest British-American
business group in the US.
Not only is there the comfort of numbers, says Mr Devoto, but they feel
'it's low risk to buy where others have bought before them and been
successful.'
