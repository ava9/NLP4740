<TEXT>
<P>
Lotus Development Corp. today announced the official opening of its Children's 
Center, an on-site day-care facility for children of its Cambridge-based 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which opened with 13 children, will ultimately accommodate 72 
children, from 3 months to 5 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
It is located on the first floor of Lotus' new developers' building, across 
from corporate headquarters in Cambridge. 
</P>
<P>
Features of the center include a sliding fee scale, so any employee whose child 
is selected to be in the center (selection is by lottery) will be able to use 
the facility; a commitment to a diverse student body and staff; a "get-well 
room" for children enrolled in the center who are recovering from mild 
illnesses, and the use of cloth diapers, for ecological reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"With this facility, Lotus is providing some of the best child care available 
to working parents anywhere in this country," said Mike Balloch, vice 
president, Corporate Services.
