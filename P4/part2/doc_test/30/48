Whatever happened to Le Defi Americain? Twenty-five years ago, when some of
us were only just starting to cut our teeth on the business world, this
elegant French thesis about the coming supremacy of US multinationals over
the Europeans was on everyone's lips.
Within a few years, the doctrine - literally, 'The American Challenge'  -
grew decidedly shaky, as European companies showed themselves remarkably
resilient against their US rivals. By the mid-1970s, with a rampant Japan on
the rise, it was dead.
Unlike 1960s fashions in most other aspects of society today, it shows no
sign of coming back into vogue. Disney is expanding in France, GE in Britain
and eastern Europe, while Philip Morris is rumoured to be back on the
European takeover warpath. But with the debacle of President Bush's trade
mission to Japan coming hard on the heels of the latest travails of IBM and
General Motors, it is evident to everyone that American big business is in
deep competitive trouble - not just against Japan, but also vis-a-vis
Europe.
The trouble may be even deeper than most people realise. For the last five
years, many American executives, economists and government policy-makers
have consoled themselves with the results of a widely quoted 1987 study of
international trade patterns. In essence, this showed that though the US
share of world exports had declined between the late 1950s and the
mid-1980s, exports from the overseas operations of US multinationals were
enabling them to hold their overall share of world trade.
Now, in a study guaranteed to make President Bush and many of his
compatriots positively bilious, a US professor has concluded that the
aggregate world share of very large American corporations has fallen far
more sharply than is generally thought, especially since the mid-1980s.
The study covers revenues from all sources, including domestic sales from
local production, which were not examined by the 1987 report. It has just
been published under the provocative title of Global Corporate Competition:
is the large American firm an endangered species?*
By analysing Fortune magazine's regular tables of top US and non-US
companies, Lawrence Franko of the University of Massachusetts has compiled a
set of global corporate 'Top 12' league tables for 15 separate industries
from 1960 through to 1990. His tables show two things: how many companies
headquartered in various countries appear in each industry's top 12; and,
for that industry, each country's collective 'world market share' - defined
as its percentage of the aggregate dollar sales revenues of the Top 12.
To the obvious objection that exchange rate fluctuations may have distorted
some of his results - notably for 1990 - Franko points out that the dollar
was also weak at other times over the study period, including in 1980 and
1988.
Takeovers and diversification beyond the strict bounds of a particular
industry may also have distorted the rankings from time to time, as may the
divestment programmes which have frequently followed such splurges. But
Franko makes some adjustment for this.
However, the overall downward US trend has been so sharp in most industries
as to make most objections little more than marginal. US companies have held
their 'world market share' of the professor's league tables since 1980 only
in aerospace, food and beverages, and (almost) paper and paper products. In
most cases, the main gainers have been Japan and Korea. But one European
country or another has surged forward in motors (Germany), banking (France),
food (Switzerland), iron and steel (Germany), paper (Sweden),
pharmaceuticals (UK), and tyres (France).
Does all this matter or is it just the expression of an increasingly
international world economy, where the US share will fall inevitably as
other nations build industrial prowess? Robert Reich, the influential US
economist, argues that corporate nationality is of fast declining
importance, since traditionally 'headquarters activities' such as research
and development are becoming dispersed geographically within 'transnational'
corporations.
Franko contests this. The most highly skilled - and highly paid - jobs are
still 'nearly universally located at headquarters' he claims. So is
decision-making over such sensitive issues as multinational tax allocation.
Franko may overstate slightly his case on the 'headquarters effect': in
reality, research and development activities, together with other corporate
decision-making jobs, are becoming quite widely dispersed in several of the
companies which appear in his various Top 12s. But these are still the
pathfinders: his general argument remains powerful. He is also right in
rebutting hopes that smaller US companies - the likes of Apple and
Microsoft, for example - may 'ride to the rescue of the nation'. During the
last 30 years, the Japanese, Koreans and the Europeans have been performing
this transformation more effectively than American counterparts, Franko
concludes.
Apart from the obvious observation that by no means all European countries -
notably Britain - have been performing nearly as well as he implies, one can
only concur with his judgment - and with his statement that the nationality
of a company's ownership can still matter considerably. Not invariably,
perhaps, but often enough to make it a cause for concern.
So what price a late 1990s French tome called 'Le Defaut Americain'? The
D-word has alternative meanings: 'shortcoming' and 'complete absence'. Take
your pick.
