EARN A LIVING. IN 1989, THE FIGURE WAS DOWN TO 60%.

In 1980, Simi Valley launched an aggressive campaign aimed at attracting new 
business to boost economic development in what was and still is considered a 
bedroom community. 
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, the city has added 1.8 million square feet of 
commercial space and 5.3 million square feet of industrial facilities, 
resulting in an estimated 15,000 new jobs, said Assistant City Manager Jay 
Corey. 
</P>
<P>
The newly created jobs have had a significant effect on the number of residents 
who commute outside the city to work. In 1980, more than 70% of the work force 
in Simi Valley traveled to Los Angeles and elsewhere to earn a living. In 1989, 
with the city's population at more than 103,000, the number of those commuting 
to work was 60%, Corey said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, for some, Simi Valley, which incorporated in 1969, is not progressing 
fast enough. When the east Ventura County city recently threatened to sue the 
city of Los Angeles to block a massive commercial and housing development in 
nearby Chatsworth, citing concerns about increased traffic and pollution, the 
issue of Simi Valley's own economic development was thrust into the forefront. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson charged that Simi Valley had failed to 
provide enough jobs for its own residents and should not complain about a 
development from which it would obviously benefit in terms of employment 
opportunities. Moreover, Bernson said Los Angeles was "sick and tired of 
supporting bedroom communities like Simi Valley and Santa Clarita" and 
suggested that Los Angeles impose an employment tax on those who come from 
outside the city to earn their living. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton, who works as an engineering manager at 
Teledyne Systems in Chatsworth, shrugged off Bernson's remarks as nothing more 
than an emotional reaction to Simi Valley's concerns over the planned Porter 
Ranch development. 
</P>
<P>
"If he wants to ship some of his businesses to Simi Valley, we'll take them," 
Stratton said. "I'd love to pick up Teledyne and move the whole thing out to 
Simi Valley." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, some San Fernando Valley firms have done just that. For example, 
Cardkey Systems Inc., with 220 employees, moved from Chatsworth to Simi Valley 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Wilson, senior marketing specialist with the security firm, said the 
company had shopped around the San Fernando Valley for a site on which to build 
before deciding on Simi Valley. He said it was simply cheaper to lease space in 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"The San Fernando Valley is becoming very expensive to run a business in," 
Wilson said. "Over the last few years, it has just skyrocketed." Wilson 
attributed the high cost of leasing space, in part, to the advent of Warner 
Center in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
He said about 30% of Cardkey's employees live in the San Fernando Valley, with 
the rest in Simi Valley and other parts of Ventura County. When the company 
announced it was going to move, he said, only two of its employees left because 
of the commute. 
</P>
<P>
Bugle Boy, a national clothing manufacturer, also made the move from Chatsworth 
to Simi Valley in 1989 for basically the same reason as Cardkey -- it was 
cheaper, said Genevieze Squires, a company official. Bugle Boy employs about 
500 people, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides better land value, the city's location and quality of life have played 
a big part in attracting new businesses, city officials said. For example, Simi 
Valley is within 30 minutes of Burbank Airport and about an hour from Los 
Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Simi Valley has consistently been listed among the safest cities 
of its size in the state in terms of major crimes committed each year, 
according to FBI statistics. The city also enjoys the highest median household 
income in Ventura County at $48,700. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other businesses that have located in Simi Valley since 1980 
include Farmers Insurance Group; First Interstate Bancard Co.; Micom Systems 
Inc., a manufacturer of data communication systems; and Whittaker Corp., a 
manufacturer of air traffic control systems and radar tracking equipment. The 
Upjohn Co. also plans to build a plant in the city next year, and Volkswagen of 
America Inc. announced plans last week to open an automobile design center in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I think collectively we have done a very good job" of attracting business, 
said Nancy Bender, executive director of the Simi Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
"I think we have a very upscale and diverse type of industry, which was our 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we did not want to do is attract one type of industry, so if 
the market went soft in one area, it wouldn't be harmful to our economy." 
</P>
<P>
One such case in point is Gibraltar Savings, which established its corporate 
headquarters in the city in 1987, employing 800 people. The savings and loan 
had plans to expand its offices and increase its work force to 3,000 employees 
before it fell into federal receivership last year. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Security Pacific Bank purchased some of Gibraltar Savings' assets. 
However, the savings and loan's Simi Valley office is still being operated 
under the supervision of federal regulators, and it is uncertain what will 
happen to the property. 
</P>
<P>
Despite disappointment over Gibraltar Savings, the city continues to move 
forward. Corey said that while the city in the past has concentrated on 
attracting industry, the emphasis is shifting toward commercial, with the 
primary goal being to construct a regional mall. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin Simon &amp; Associates, the nation's second-largest shopping center 
developer, has proposed building a $200-million mall on a 60-acre site just 
north of the Simi Valley Freeway, between 1st Street and Erringer Road. 
</P>
<P>
The developer has said it hopes to open the two-level mall, which would include 
five department stores, by the end of 1993. In addition to providing hundreds 
of jobs, the mall is expected to generate an estimated $3 million in annual 
revenues for the city. 
</P>
<P>
That would provide a significant boost to the city's current sales tax revenue, 
which was reported at $6.7 million for the 1989-90 fiscal year. As in most 
cities, such revenues are Simi Valley's single largest source of income to pay 
for such city services as street maintenance and fire and police protection. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the economic benefits, Stratton said the mall will serve as a 
focal point for the community. 
</P>
<P>
"The mall seems to be part of our culture," Stratton said. "It's like the 
downtown of old Midwestern towns. It is a necessary part of your city. It 
provides a feeling that the city is complete." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city is looking forward to the opening of the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library, which is expected to attract 250,000 to 300,000 visitors 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
The library, which is being built on 100 acres of unincorporated land at the 
southwest end of the city, is scheduled to open in February. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Reagan Library will be very beneficial to our economy," Bender 
said. "It will bring a steady flow of people to visit and in turn they will 
spend their money in the city." 
</P>
<P>
Bender said the Chamber of Commerce already uses the library in its promotional 
campaigns to lure companies to Simi Valley. In addition, she said a book 
promoting the city and the library will be published next year, to coincide 
with the opening, and will be distributed at bookstores across the country. 
</P>
<P>
"When something that noteworthy locates in a community, people will want to 
become more familiar with the community," Bender said. The library, she 
predicted, is going to "make a major change in the perception, and interest, in 
Simi Valley. It's going to be rather awesome." 
</P>
<P>
So is it still fair to refer to Simi Valley as a bedroom community? 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't refer to it that way anymore," Bender said. "Maybe 10 years ago, 
but not now. I think we have too much activity here. I think we have started to 
come out of that era." 
</P>
<P>
Stratton, on the other hand, isn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably still is a little bit" of a bedroom community, he said. But, he 
added, "we try not to think of ourselves that way."
