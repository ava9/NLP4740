BRITISH Gas is cutting 1,240 jobs from its headquarters staff as part of a
rationalisation programme that will save Pounds 30m a year. It is also
freezing salaries this year for board members although performance-related
bonuses will not be affected.
The moves come amid continuing cost pressures on British Gas as it faces
increasing competition in its industrial market. Mr Cedric Brown, British
Gas's chief executive, said yesterday the aim was to make management more
effective and efficient.
The company said it planned to achieve the job cuts by voluntary
redundancies over the next five months and will put a freeze on external
recruitment.
British Gas will also slim its corporate centre by moving research and
technology functions to its new research station at Loughborough,
Leicestershire, and will contract out many of its engineering construction
functions.
Mr Brown said: 'We want the corporate centre to focus closely on the
company's strategic direction and devolve responsibility to the business
units to manage their own affairs.'
British Gas comprises three business units: UK gas business, exploration and
production and global gas.
The rationalisation programme will cost about Pounds 70m and the company
expects it to pay for itself in 18 months to two years.
The number of headquarters staff based in London will be reduced to 460 from
3,700. The company will close two research stations in London and one in
Solihull, West Midlands. Research and technology staff will be cut by about
500 from 1,600. Engineering construction personnel will be cut by about 500
from 1,200. The rest of the redundancies will be met from support staff at
the corporate headquarters.
The company says it has put together a redundancy package which guarantees a
minimum of 26 weeks' pay for all employees.
British Gas is involved in pay negotiations with its industrial workers
which could lead to staff being awarded a pay rise while board directors
have their pay frozen this year.
Mr Brown stressed that the company was setting a range of tough targets for
managers performance bonuses.
