"Cultural Traditions and the Concept of Human Rights"] 
  [Text] U.S. State Department once again issued a "report on 
human rights" on 1 February. Repeating the same old tune, it 
once again made irresponsible remarks about the human rights 
conditions in quite a few countries throughout the world and 
distorted, criticized, and attacked China's domestic situation. 
These allegations have been solemnly refuted by the relevant 
countries, and the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman has again 
clearly expressed our country's position of resolutely opposing 
taking human rights as an excuse to interfere in China's 
internal affairs. 
  With regard to the human rights issue, people may recall the 
remarks that Chairman Jiang Zemin made at his official meeting 
with U.S. President Clinton in Seattle last November. He said: 
There are nearly 1,000 nationalities and approximately 200 
nations on earth, with a great variety of cultural traditions 
and lifestyles, making the world rich and colorful. This fact 
is also reflected in human rights concepts. In the developed 
countries of Europe and the Americas and in the developing 
countries of the East, there are also differences in the concept 
of human rights owing to varying cultural traditions, ways of 
life, and stages of development. For example, over 2,000 years 
ago, China's ancient philosophers had the ideology of treasuring 
the people and cherishing universal love such as "the people are 
the foundation of an imperial ancestral temple," "it is a virtue 
to honor other aged people and look after other children as we 
do our own," and so on. China's socialist way of life has 
conditioned the extent, fairness, and sincerity of stressing 
human rights, which has been obtained by the Chinese people 
through hard struggle and sacrifice with bloodshed. When 
signboards saying "no admittance to Chinese and dogs" were hung 
on the gates of Chinese parks, what human rights did the Chinese 
people have? China is a developing country with a large 
population, and the right of development is an important right 
that has a bearing on the destiny and future of the Chinese 
nation. This is China's national situation, and the European 
and American countries have a different kind of national 
situations. Their cultural traditions cannot be traced to the 
same origin, not to mention their life-styles and stages of 
development. The concept on human rights in European and 
American countries primarily originated from the ideological 
trend of humanism formed in the European Renaissance Movement. 
At that time, the rising bourgeoisie regarded personal freedom 
and the pursuit of personal happiness as natural instincts of 
human beings, and took these as their theoretical bases to 
oppose religious prerogative, hierarchy, and feudal rule. No 
doubt, this ideological trend had tremendous, historic 
significance for pushing forward social progress and development 
at that time, but it also had notable historical limitations. 
Here, we might as well review some famous expositions by the 
founders of the theory on human rights in Europe. 
  First, the personal freedom and happiness that they pursued 
was, in essence, the right to possess property. The British 
political ideologist Locke, called by Marx and Engels as the 
"founding father" of bourgeois liberalism, maintained: In the 
"human rights endowed by nature," including life, freedom, 
property, and so on, which can neither be given away nor taken, 
property rights are the most fundamental of rights. His famous 
remark was: The grass that my horses graze and the soil that my 
servants plow are all my property. Property alone -- rather than 
blood lineage or the will of God -- is the symbol of rights. In 
fact, when Locke and other ideologists during the bourgeois 
revolution period flaunted the banner of the "natural right" to 
oppose religious prerogative and feudal autocracy, they "used 
the privilege of money to replace all personal and hereditary 
privileges of the past." When the U.S. Constitution--the first 
bourgeois constitution written in the world--was formulated in 
1787, possession of property and payment of taxes were taken as 
a prerequisite for obtaining the right to vote. Incidentally, in 
accordance with this constitution, American blacks and women 
were deprived of the right to vote for a long time due to their 
"natural" color and sex. As a matter of fact, it was not until 
the 1960's that universal suffrage was practiced in the United 
States, which was stipulated in the first constitution of New 
China. 
  Second, the European humanist concept of human rights 
acknowledges that "all men are born equal," but, in defining 
this right, it also acknowledges that, owing to the unequal 
strength of men, it is reasonable to swallow one another up. 
The most typical expression of this idea was made by Spinoza, 
the 17th century Dutch political ideologist, who said: "The 
greatest natural right of a big fish is to swallow little 
fishes." His theory of natural rights maintained that a man's 
right endowed by nature is identical with his natural 
aspirations and strength. In other words, the extent of a man's 
right is decided by the extent of his strength. He openly 
advocated the law of the jungle -- the weak are the prey of the 
strong. According to this theory, then, in the development 
process of old-style capitalist countries, their policies of 
colonial expansion, the slave trade, and gunboat diplomacy were 
undoubtedly logical. The Yuanming Garden was looted and burned 
by the Eight-Power Allied Forces, but China had to pay a large 
sum of money as "compensation!" Of course, this is now history, 
but hegemonism and power politics have far from disappeared from 
international life, as people can still discern from this, the 
shadow of the history of that period. 
  The humanist ideology of the European bourgeois 
revolutionary 
forerunners has made historical contributions. History has made 
giant advances for three centuries, and earth-shaking changes 
have taken place throughout the world. We should inherit their 
ideology critically -- not to mention the even more ancient and 
brilliant civilizations which can be compared and taken as a 
reference apart from the ideology that originated in Europe. 
Therefore, it is very natural that different countries and 
nations have identical or different stands and viewpoints on the 
issue of human rights. If they cannot reach a consensus for the 
moment, it is definitely possible to seek common ground while 
reserving differences. Under no circumstances, however, should 
a certain concept of human rights be imposed on others, still 
less should the issue of human rights be used to meddle in other 
countries' internal affairs, or to exert political pressure on 
them. Otherwise, they will not be able achieve their aim and, 
more often than not, the result will be opposite to the desired 
effect. As a Western saying goes: They will only shoot 
themselves in the foot.
