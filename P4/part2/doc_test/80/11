One hundred years after the start of the decade that proved pivotal for the 
U.S. women's movement, an exhibition at the Smithsonian's National Museum of 
American History in Washington, D.C, commemorates women's political 
contributions.

"From Parlor to Politics: Women and Reform in America, 1890-1925" offers about 
275 photographs and more than 700 objects, including sheet music, playbills, 
silk banners and buttons.

The exhibition focuses on such endeavors as the temperance movement, women's 
suffrage, the home economics movement and labor reforms.

Congress for women's right to vote is on display.

Other items related to pioneers in political campaigns include Frances 
Willard's traveling tea set that made an anti-alcohol statement, and the Nobel 
Peace Prize awarded to Jane Addams for a lifetime of efforts toward world 
peace.

One portion of the exhibit re-creates Chicago's famous Hull House settlement 
and social experiment, established by Addams in 1889.

Constitution Avenue N.W. Hours: daily, 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. For more

No kidding: In a recent Hilton Hotels survey, kids were asked what they would 
most like to take with them on vacation. Most popular responses were a book 
(71%), a video game or Nintendo set (68%), a favorite doll or toy (60%) and a 
pet (53%). Among the other answers: lots of gum, New Kids on the Block posters, 
a go-cart, computer, electric guitar, strobe light, microwave, the house, a 
statue and a doll house. A total of 300 children, ages 6 to 12, were 
interviewed in 10 cities. The most unusual responses may have been "all 77 of 
my Breyer horses" and "a ceiling fan."

Stop the presses: A recent news release from Cathay Pacific Airways announcing 
its new Los Angeles-Hong Kong service included a list of awards won by the

Nicaragua update: Travel warnings to Nicaragua have been officially lifted by
