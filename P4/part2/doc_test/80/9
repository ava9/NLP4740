* HISTORY: San Diego architect Richard S. Requa designed the domed, four-story 
Spanish tower after the campanile over Christopher Columbus' tomb in Havana. It 
was built in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
* LOCATION: 201 E. Ojai Avenue in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
* HOURS: The tower is closed for viewing, but the post office lobby is open 
24-hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
The 65-foot bell tower of the Ojai post office tolls every hour between 8 a.m. 
and 9 p.m. and peels out patriotic tunes at noon on amplified Westminster 
chimes. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny door to the spiral staircase is locked to all except volunteer 
bellkeeper Billie Powers, a local contractor, who has kept the chimes tolling 
over Ojai for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
The local Altrusa Club raised funds to donate the chimes in 1969. The effort 
began after city officials decided that a city employee might not be able to 
ring the old fire bell promptly every day at noon. 
</P>
<P>
Historian Patricia L. Fry says that after the post office was built in 1917, 
the town's fewer than 500 residents changed its name to Ojai from Nordhoff, 
fearing their mail would go to Norwalk by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
On June 30, 1975, the Ojai Post Office tower and sidewalk portico became 
Ventura County Historical Landmark No. 26, along with an old sycamore tree in 
Libbey Park nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Drummond Libbey, Ohio glass magnate who spent winters in Ojai, donated 
the civic park. He hired Requa in 1914 to design a series of other prominent 
Spanish-style buildings for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ojai has never had its own postmark, with its current daily average of 
55,000 pieces of mail routed through Oxnard, its fiesty community spirit has 
often reached officials in Washington. In 1893, Nordhoff set two national 
precedents by staging an independent selection of its postmaster and by 
allowing women to vote in his election, 27 years before the 19th Amendment 
granted women's suffrage. 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, a petition signed by 1,005 Ojai Valley residents urged postal 
officials to reconsider their plans to move out of the small building. A dozen 
citizens lent money to expand it. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight years later, Ojai Postmaster John Wolfard said he feared he would 
be lynched for supporting renewed efforts by postal officials to build another 
building with more mail-room space and employee parking. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with a petition of 2,447 signatures demanding the post office be kept 
under the tower, the Ojai City Council persuaded state and federal lawmakers to 
leave the downtown office with 1,530 rental boxes where it remains.. 
</P>
<P>
"They run into a lot of their old friends and socialize while collecting their 
mail," Wolfard said of his patron's passion for the 
</P>
<P>
This summer, the building's trustees, the Ojai Civic Assn., is negotiating a 
long-term lease with the U.S. Postal Service to keep the lobby open at least 
another 10 years. The association uses the current $55,000 annual rent for 
improvements to Libbey Park. 
</P>
<P>
The post office tower and portico, built of unreinforced masonry, are also on 
the city's list for mandatory earthquake reinforcement. THIA BELL
