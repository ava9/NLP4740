FT  28 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS copper heads for West

About 60,000 tonnes of copper has built up in stocks in the Commonwealth of
Independent States and is now available for export to the west, analysts
suggest.
However, they say the market should absorb the extra copper relatively
easily. Also, as western merchants have been competitively bidding for the
metal for some weeks, the present price is probably taking account of the
CIS stock overhang.
'Remember the western copper market was in deficit by 200,000 to 250,000
tonnes in the first half of this year. So we should not get too carried away
with the bearishness of this issue,' says Mr Peter Hollands of the
London-based Bloomsbury Minerals Economics consultancy organisation.
A late spring, transport difficulties, and bureaucratic delays in export
licensing all contributed to the CIS stock build-up. Mr Hollands suggests
that 10,000 to 25,000 tonnes from CIS stock will arrive in the west in
August and the monthly total will then settle at about 25,000 to 30,000
tonnes for the rest of 1994. This compares with 15,000 tonnes a month in the
first half.
Mr Hollands says that the impact on the copper price will depend on how
sales of the CIS metal are handled. 'I think that it will be done carefully
and will simply slow the rate at which prices rise, or cause them to
stabilise for some months. But if too much copper comes too quickly, it
could have a severe impact for a month or two.'
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, points out that falls in London Metal
Exchange copper stocks have slowed markedly and 'if they start to rise again
(because of the CIS shipments) the hot money backing copper will start to
look for another home.'
He suggests: 'People are begining to recognise that copper's charmed days
are nearing their end.' The market will have to cope with a steady and
substantial rise in supply until the year 2,000. Demand would have to grow
by 5 per cent a year to balance the market whereas a 2.5 per cent growth was
more realistic. Mr Moore is forecasting that copper's price will average 95
cents a pound (Dollars 2,094 a tonne) this year and 92 cents (Dollars 2,028)
in 1995. That price would not not be low enough to deter planned increases
in capacity.
Selling by US funds drove copper for delivery in three months on the LME
down another Dollars 86 a tonne yesterday to Dollars 2,408.50 (Dollars 1.09
a pound) by the close.
