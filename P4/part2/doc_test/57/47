CHANGES at the top of Wall Street securities house Salomon Brothers
continued yesterday when Mr Robert Salomon replaced Mr Michael Holland as
head of the asset management division.
Mr Holland left Salomon on Monday to become a vice-chairman at Oppenheimer,
the fund management group.
Although the departure of Mr Holland was not directly related to fall-out
from the bond trading scandal which engulfed Salomon last year and which led
to a massive shake-up of the company's senior management, it is the latest
in a series of top defections.
Last week, Mr Denis Bovins, a key executive in Salomon's investment banking
department, left to join rival Wall Street firm Bear Stearns.
Mr Salomon, who is a direct descendant of the family that founded Salomon
Brothers and who has been at the firm for 16 years, will take over the asset
management unit at a time when demand from institutions and wealthy
individuals for professional management of their money is booming.
Salomon Brothers Asset Management is only three years old, but in that time
it has amassed more than Dollars 8.6bn in advisory assets, plus an
additional Dollars 7bn in assets held by the Resolution Trust Corporation,
the government agency overseeing the bail-out of the collapsed thrift
industry.
Although the asset management division is still a small contributor to
Salomon's total earnings - bond trading and sales remain the mainstay of the
firm - it will play an increasingly important role in the future.
In common with many other big Wall Street firms, Salomon is expected to
build up the parts of the company that provide a regular stream of fee-based
revenues as insurance against the volatility of its earnings from
traditional securities business.
