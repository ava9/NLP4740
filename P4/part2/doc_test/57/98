LLOYDS Chemists yesterday followed up its recommended Pounds 96m bid for
Macarthy with interim results showing an 88 per cent increase in pre-tax
profit.
On sales 94 per cent ahead at Pounds 218.4m (Pounds 112.6m), pre-tax profit
went up from Pounds 8.2m to Pounds 15.4m in the six months to December 31.
Mr Allen Lloyd, chairman and chief executive, said the performance proved
that healthcare retailing was 'safe retailing'. He added that 'When times
are tough, people are more susceptible to illness.'
Lloyds' diluted earnings per share grew rather less rapidly to 10.86p
(8.95p). This reflected extra equity from last spring's Pounds 71m rights
issue to fund the Pounds 55m acquisition of Kingswood-GK chemists and
Holland &amp; Barrett health stores.
These additional 350 stores, plus three smaller acquisitions in 1991, helped
drive the figures ahead.
At this time last year (pre-Kingswood), the group had 455 chemists and 174
drugstores. Now (pre-Macarthy) it has nearly 1,080 outlets, including 667
chemists, 211 drugstores and 197 health stores.
First-half operating profit rose by 67 per cent to Pounds 16.7m. Mr Dick
Steele, finance director, said the apparent decline in margin was caused by
inclusion of Holland &amp; Barrett and the new wholesaling division, which had
slimmer margins than chemists and drugstores.
Before the Macarthy bid, net debt was Pounds 21.1m, gearing of 35 per cent.
If the deal went through (UniChem may still re-enter the fray), Mr Steele
said he expected gearing to rise to 60 per cent, on combined net assets of
roughly Pounds 80m.
The interim dividend goes up to 1.55p (1.17p).
COMMENT
Lloyds seems to be making as high a trading margin in its chemists division
as Boots, ie 9 per cent. This is remarkable, especially as half of Boots'
shops are freehold and it enjoys considerable benefits from the type of
electronic information system that Lloyds is only now introducing.
Explanations include its modest sites (where Boots does pay rent it is for
prime locations), its tight control of the payroll and other costs, high
margins on own-label products and highly efficient distribution. Once this
is applied to Macarthy, with a liberal helping of acquisition provisions,
analysts start shoving up 1992-93 pre-tax profit forecasts from Pounds 40m
to more than Pounds 50m. Reasons for caution include the group's propensity
to issue paper, while doing less well than expected on the cashflow and
gearing. If Pounds 35m (Pounds 20.8m) is made this year, the prospective p/e
is about 15 on yesterday's close of 347p. This is just above the market, but
below the stores sector which is more geared to recovery. The shares have
had a good run but remain worth holding for acquisition benefits and
defensive qualities.
