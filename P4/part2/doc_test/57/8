shares dive 95p

BOOSEY &amp; Hawkes, one of Britain's oldest instrument makers, yesterday
announced a 10 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.44m,
but warned that the global recession was beginning to dampen growth.
The City marked the shares down by 95p to 865p on the news, in a generally
steady market.
Mr Richard Holland, chief executive, said he was baffled by the fall in the
share price. 'The result we produced is a very good one in the current
climate,' he said. 'All we are saying is we must accept a slower rate of
growth compared with the 20 per cent of previous years.'
The dividend was raised by 9 per cent to 6p, while earnings advanced almost
13 per cent to 18.6p (16.5p).
Mr Holland said the group expected to report progress in the second half
similar to that of the first six months. However, profits would be depressed
by about Pounds 200,000 as a result of the recent sterling crisis. He said
the devaluation of sterling would eventually benefit the company as it
sought to increase exports.
Boosey reported an 8 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 26.5m for the six
months to June 30.
Growth was slower in the music publishing division partly due to the depth
of the US recession. However, Mr Holland said the rate of growth represented
a 'more normal' level, following last year's sharp improvement.
The instrument making division felt the effects of economic slowdown in
Japan, which accounts for about 20 per cent of sales. Profits in this
division had advanced, although not as rapidly as last year. Mr Holland said
there was a risk of a further setback in Japan, although he remained
optimistic about the longer-term outlook.
A redundancy programme in the UK and Germany resulted in the loss of about
40 jobs. There would be no significant redundancy costs, Mr Holland said,
although the benefits would feed through next year.
Interest charges rose about 10 per cent to Pounds 1m, due to the element of
foreign currency debt. Borrowings as a percentage of shareholders' funds was
at a seasonal high of 88 per cent. Gearing at the year end was expected to
be lower than the 69 per cent in 1991.
