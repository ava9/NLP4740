The San Diego Chargers have reached an agreement to trade wide receiver Jamie 
Holland to the Raiders for a seventh-round draft pick, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders were to announce the trade after receiving contract papers from Los 
Angeles and Holland's agent, Steve Feldman. 
</P>
<P>
"He's happy to be in L.A., and I think he'll do extremely well," Feldman said 
Wednesday. "We worked out a one-year deal this weekend and the documents were 
signed (Wednesday)." 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Bobby Beathard said Wednesday that the Chargers and Raiders 
have "agreed on the terms of the trade," but said the deal was contingent upon 
the Raiders making contact with Holland. He declined to discuss the terms of 
the trade. 
</P>
<P>
However, The San Diego Union, citing anonymous sources, reported today that 
Holland will go to the Raiders for a seventh-round choice. 
</P>
<P>
Because Holland is a free agent, he technically must sign with the Chargers 
before moving to Los Angeles. Feldman said the Chargers will receive signed 
paper work today. 
</P>
<P>
"I sensed in the off-season that Jamie might not fit in their plans and the 
chance to go to L.A. is a great opportunity," said Feldman. "They're looking to 
return to kickoff-return form from 1988, and want to use him a lot in their 
three-and four-wide-receiver set." 
</P>
<P>
Holland, 26, came to the Chargers from Ohio State. In three years in San Diego, 
he caught 71 passes for 1,010 yards and one touchdown, but failed to establish 
himself as a consistent performer. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Holland started opposite Anthony Miller when the Chargers went to 
a two-receiver set, but in 16 games he caught only 26 passes for 336 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Holland returned 79 kickoffs for the Chargers for an average of 21.9 yards. His 
94-yard return for a touchdown to close out the 1988 season against Kansas City 
stands as the third-longest in club history.
