IN A rainy Paris suburb Bertrand Tavernier is shooting his new feature. His
last film was the acclaimed These Foolish Things starring a pre-knighthood
Dirk Bogarde. L 627 has no stars, no knights and seems a spectacularly
humble project for France's most acclaimed modern film-maker: the man who
put storytelling back into post-New Wave cinema with films like Sunday In
The Country, Round Midnight and Life And Nothing But.
Tavernier's new project could also be a symbol for beleaguered European
movie-making on the brink of 1992: lashed by rain ('Engleesh wezzair]' the
director complains as I hove in view with my Monoprix umbrella); made on a
shoestring; and with a title incomprehensible to anyone outside its native
country.
The bearish, snow-haired director sets me down in the mobile canteen for
lunch and enlightens me. The movie is a crime story about drugs and
delinquency - very accessible - and its title refers to an article of French
law about police treatment of drug offenders.
'I feel I am returning to my roots,' proclaims Tavernier. Having just
finished a four-hour documentary about Algeria, bought by BBC2, he explains
that he was in a mood to do a small documentary-style feature. 'I wrote the
script with a real 'cop', Michel Alexandre, and I spent four months with the
police listening to them, living with them, seeing them make arrests. It's a
small film, it's not The French Connection. It's about the daily lives of a
group of cops and small-time dealers.'
Not The French Connection. But doesn't that sum up French cinema's crisis
today? It was once Europe's flagship movie nation, propelled across the seas
of world fame by the most famous New Wave in history. Now it seems unable to
make French Connection-style box-office hits or even to create much of a
stir at the arthouse.
'I've been hearing ze word crisis since I started,' sighs Tavernier. 'It's
not a crisis of talent. Look at the French films which won awards at Venice.
And in Cannes everyone praised La Belle Noiseuse of Rivette. And we have
Pialat, Doillon. What other country produces this quality of work?'
Yet the names Tavernier picks - an assortment of New Wave veterans and
relative newcomers - pinpoint the uneasy transitional phase France has been
in ever since the Godard-Truffaut-Chabrol heyday. Tavernier is the only
French film-maker to have succeeded consistently, from his first feature The
Clockmaker Of St Paul to his masterpiece to date Life And Nothing But, in
straddling the chasm between New Wave modernism and France's post-modern
return to narrative in films like Betty Blue and Subway.
He is neither a revolutionary nor a reactionary. He is a humanist in the
Renoir tradition and he sees his role as that of a reconciler. 'I don't
believe in 'theory', which was a great part of the New Wave. At the same
time I reject those who label me as a 1950s-style theatrical film-maker like
Autant-Lara or Ophuls. I have never been part of that tradition. I love
location, improvisation; mixing professional and nonprofessional actors.
'The one thing those '50s directors taught me was not to be afraid of
history. The New Wave film-makers would not go near a historical subject; it
was too 'respectable' for them, too inert. But for me when I make a film
like Life And Nothing But it is not a dead subject, even if it is set on the
battlefields of the First War. I made that film out of anger. People are
surprised you can be angry about the past. But much of what is wrong with
France today has its roots in that time: when official truth takes over from
real truth. My anger is like Noiret's (the hero played by Philippe Noiret)
when I fight the government today. It is the same fight, for the same
freedoms, with the same frustrations.'
As a movie storyteller Tavernier is more traditional than his New Wave
forebears. But stories themselves, he insists, are not what cinema is about.
'I hate the idea of 'plot.' I like films that relate more to music, to ideas
of rhythm and counterpoint, films that hesitate or meander.' But within a
precise time-frame surely? Look at the obsession with units of time in
Tavernier's titles: A Week's Vacation, Sunday In The Country, Round
Midnight. 'Yes, I've always resisted stories that are set over months or
years. I can't bear it when actors use make-up to age: I love them too much
to want them to use tricks.'
That creative sympathy with his players is Tavernier's special gift and
gives his films their special humanity. His casts become part of the
film-making process, with the director even handing them earlier reject
drafts of the script so they can trace their characters' evolution.
'French actors make it so easy. They are very analytical, they think about
everything that makes up a person's character. Noiret was for a while my
technical adviser on Life And Nothing But, because he had learned so much
about military laws and customs. Whereas the American actor Harvey Keitel,
when I made Death Watch with him, would say, 'Do I have two shirt-buttons
open in this scene and why?'
'The 'Method'] European actors approach a part responsibly; they are
well-read, they often have a classical theatre background. A Method actor is
lost when he does a historical film. Look at Al Pacino in Revolution. He is
playing a peasant, but no peasant at that time would speak with that voice.
That soft voice, almost a whisper. It is the voice of man brought up in a
city, not one who has to shout across fields and hills to call his son home
to dinner. And yet Pacino studied the part for months.'
But the Pacinos of this world, as the 1990s roll back the frontiers between
European countries and between Europe and America, may more and more be
filling studios in Paris and Rome, London and Berlin. Tavernier sees
cultural imperialism - the spreading empire of Hollywood - as the worst
threat to cinema today.
'There is no doubt that America after 1992 will be able to impose a way of
film-making. Co-productions will have to be in English and few of us will be
able to say no. Half the phone calls I get now from French producers are for
English-speaking films. A third of public TV in France is in English. Worse
 -it is in mid-Atlantic.
'To finance a film you will have to have an American star. Then you will
have to cater to an American audience. I give you an example. When we were
making Round Midnight the producer Irwin Winkler said the French hero could
not give the American jazz player Camembert, which in France is the most
everyday cheese. I said 'Why?'. Winkler said because to Americans it will
seem something special, expensive. They will think these people are
upper-class. Yet Camembert to a Parisian is the most ordinary cheese. Well,
there were memos about this] I should have shrugged and had my hero give him
Kelloggs Corn Flakes.
'These details are tiny but they are part of a mosaic. Cinema is about what
you see even if you see it 'unconsciously.' That is what makes it special as
an art. Certain images catch something in five or six seconds that would
take pages to produce the same effect in a novel. The feeling of Monument
Valley in John Ford's films: the light, the heat, the sand. Certain effects
of movement: of stillness versus action. Or that last charge of Custer in
Raoul Walsh's film, shot from high above when the previous charges have been
shot from low down on the ground. Suddenly, because of that camera angle,
what was heroic has become something stupid, doomed, sad. You cannot
describe this in words, but it is the same effect as a beautiful line of
poetry. It is what cinema alone can do.'
