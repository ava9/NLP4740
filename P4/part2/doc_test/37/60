THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MOBSTERS AND MAGNATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Writing on gangster films in the Sept. 23 issue, both Patrick Goldstein and 
Peter Rainer attempt to establish a link between gangsterism and free 
enterprise. They make this appalling comparison by conveniently blanking out 
the meaning of the word free. 
</P>
<P>
Capitalism involves the voluntary exchange of goods between people. Any form of 
coercion -- by government or individual -- is the negation of free enterprise. 
The gangster's stock in trade is coercion at its most brutal. 
</P>
<P>
Al Capone told speak-easy owners to either buy his beer or have their kneecaps 
busted and their barrooms blown to pieces. This was hardly a voluntary exchange 
of goods. And when Vito Corleone puts a loaded gun to somebody's head and makes 
him "an offer he can't refuse," he's not acting as an apostle of Adam Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The next time Rainer and Goldstein ask for a raise, Times management should 
take a negotiating tip from the Godfather and place a severed horse head in 
their beds. Maybe then they'll appreciate the difference between gangsterism 
and the free market.
