<P>
So there was Al Pacino on "Wheel of Fortune" -- not the one with Vanna White, 
the one on CBS in the early 1950s that rewarded good deeds. It seems that 
someone had called the show's attention to an incident involving young Al and 
his 12-year-old buddy Brucie Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
As the episode was reported on the show, Al and Brucie were playing around at a 
construction site in the Bronx when Brucie, showing off near the edge of a 
building, toppled over and clung to the edge until Al, at the risk of his own 
neck, pulled him back. The next thing Al knew, the TV show was handing him a 
check and calling him a hero. And if he didn't know it already, he was suddenly 
aware of the difference between stupid risks and good ones. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be able to really define what a risk is," Pacino muses on this 
Dante's Inferno day, with the air-conditioning at producer Martin Bregman's 
office no match for New York's Oscar-winning humidity. With the erotic 
mystery-thriller "Sea of Love," which opened Friday, Pacino is nonetheless 
draped in funereal black -- part Bela Lugosi, part bella Armani. Sweaty-eyed 
and weary, starting sentences four different ways before he latches onto the 
words he wants, Pacino gamely explains how risk-management has kept an actor 
deemed one of the four or five post-Brando gods away from movies for almost 
half a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing a picture when you're not prepared to is not a good risk," Pacino says 
slowly, in a voice like charred gravel. "I mean, jumping off a building and 
seeing if you're 
</P>
<P>
gonna make it when you fall . . . 'Hey, maybe I'll just break a couple of 
legs!' " he jokes. "So much has to do with where you are, your timing and 
stuff. When you start to feel you wanna make a movie again, then whatever 
(script) is there, available, you start to look at a little bit differently. 
Because it's a reality -- your gonna do it." 
</P>
<P>
That's a relief, because he hasn't done it in quite a while. We're talking 
about an actor who had rolled through five Academy Award-nominated performances 
in seven years -- "The Godfather" (1972), "Serpico" (1973), "The Godfather, 
Part II" (1974), "Dog Day Afternoon" (1975), " . . . And Justice for All" 
(1979) -- and co-starred in a 1973 Cannes Grand Prix winner ("Scarecrow") to 
boot. There was the popular, controversial "Scarface" (1983), followed by a 
successful Broadway revival of David Mamet's "American Buffalo." Yet, ever 
since the virtually nonexistent, $28-million dud "Revolution" (1985), Pacino 
has been in what you might call his John-Lennon-bread-baking phase. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, like Lennon upon his re-emergence, the 49-year-old Pacino still 
has his chops. His burnt-out "Sea of Love" detective, Frank Keller, is another 
of his quintessential New York cop characters, the man Frank Serpico might have 
become had he given in and stayed on the force 20 years, treading in a sea of 
booze. With John Goodman as his partner investigating the serial murders of 
personals-ad Casanovas, and Ellen Barkin as the suspect he falls for in a 
typically crackling script by Richard Price, Pacino is, as he puts it, "in and 
around territory I've been around before." 
</P>
<P>
Pacino, like Keller, has hit his own 20-year mark, dating from his movie debut 
in the minor drug drama "Me, Natalie" (1969). Pacino, like Keller, has had 
serious bouts with the bottle, and has known his way around the dark side of 
the street, losing friends to the needle. Pacino, like Keller, is one of the 
best at what he does, which still doesn't mitigate the angst around the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel I'm that close to that guy," Pacino insists. "You just try to 
feed into the part things in your life that 
</P>
<P>
coincide with the character you're playing. A guy like Frank, who doesn't have 
the love in his life, has the work. And now he's about to lose the work," since 
he's expected after 20 years to retire on half-pay. Pacino's take: "If you can 
still work, if you still enjoy the work, it's only time to retire when you no 
longer wanna do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess playing the part now, as opposed to playing it 10 years ago, I have a 
closer understanding, a more tactile understanding of the character," he says, 
"because of my age and I understand that situation he's in. I'll look at parts 
now sometimes, and I'll know it would have excited me to do that five years 
ago, and now another kind of thing will excite me. It really comes down to what 
you want to address at this point in your life -- the things you start to find 
are relevant to you." 
</P>
<P>
Pacino has that luxury. At the same time, like Hamlet, the Melancholoy Italian 
doesn't give the impression of someone who knows what he wants. "That's 
probably the reason I got into acting," he reflects. "So I don't have to think. 
I think the reason I act is for a relief from thinking." Yet even considering 
the leeway rightly accorded artists, Pacino's choices over the last few years 
have been puzzling. He's kept busy. He just hasn't kept busy with anything any 
of us can actually go see. 
</P>
<P>
There were workshop productions of "Crystal Clear," "National Anthems" and 
other plays, including a current Manhattan project he's not ready to talk 
about. There was "Julius Caesar" for Joseph Papp last year. There was 
"Carlito's Way," if you go by Elliot Kastner's lawsuit alleging that Pacino 
committed to the film last April for $4 million plus a profit percentage. And 
most 
</P>
<P>
time-consuming, there is "The Local Stigmatic," a play Pacino had starred in 
Off Broadway in 1969 then re-mounted in 1985 with director David Wheeler and 
the Theater Company of Boston to film a 50-minute movie version that may become 
his "Unfinished Symphony." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people relate to that kind of private work," he says. "Because 
(acting) is such a visible profession that if you're not real visible in it, 
they assume you're not working. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember back when everything was happening, '74, '75, doing ("The 
Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui") on stage and reading that the reason I'd gone 
back to the stage was that my movie career was waning! That's been the kind of 
ethos, the way in which theater's perceived, unfortunately. My big problem has 
been that I've been trying to ride both rails. And I can tell that some of my 
work has been affected by that. I wish I was able to have gone into both media 
with more focus." 
</P>
<P>
He's trying, and the $16-million "Sea of Love" required all the focus he could 
give it. Producer Bregman let the original director go days before shooting was 
to begin, bringing in Harold Becker ("The Onion Field," "The Boost") for a 
long, grueling shoot that lasted from about May through September of last year. 
Pacino did a cameo in Warren Beatty's "Dick Tracy," playing Big Boy, "the 
world's largest dwarf." He dabbled with "Three Thousand," reading with Julia 
Roberts for the role being played by Richard Gere. And in November, he begins 
production on "The Godfather, Part III." "It's that movie to do, so you sorta 
gotta do it," he says smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I wish, in some ways, the government forced me to make a movie once 
a year," he adds, with a laugh. "There would be a sort of regularity, a kind of 
consistency in the output so that your movies don't become blown all out of 
proportion -- it turns a simple movie into an epic kind of thing, if you make 
them only every few years. I've decided not to go as long between them. The 
idea of going two years between pictures, I'd rather not." 
</P>
<P>
Then again, a few years of that might remind him why he slowed down. 
</P>
<P>
"When it was all happening to me," he says of his firecracker string in the 
'70s, "I don't think I was aware of it. I knew around me things were going on. 
But I kept trying to focus on the next play or movie I was gonna do. And when I 
looked up it was five years later." 
</P>
<P>
The thought brings him in mind of a story: 
</P>
<P>
"We were doing 'Richard III' in Philadelphia one winter, and first we're in 
this sort of marathon rehearsal and then playing night after night there. And I 
remember one day finally getting in the car to drive back to New York, and we 
stopped at a light and I looked out and thought, 'What are these people doing, 
they don't have coats on, they're just walking without a coat?' And my friend 
says, 'It's spring, Al.' "
