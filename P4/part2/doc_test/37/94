MR Shin Kanemaru, the disgraced 'godfather' of Japanese politics, was under
increasing pressure last night from within his ruling Liberal Democratic
Party to respond to public criticism of his behaviour by making a
ritualistic show of remorse.
The ruling party has been shaken by continuing public protests and polls
reflecting deep disgust with the lenient treatment of Mr Kanemaru, who was
given a Y200,000 (Pounds 984) fine for accepting an illegal donation of
Y500m from a parcel delivery company. There is also public anger over his
apparently frequent dealings with gangster groups.
Mr Kanemaru was under attack yesterday on two fronts, from within his own
faction, the party's largest, and from other LDP factions. Seven MPs from
three different factions yesterday urged the 'godfather' to resign from the
party, while others have suggested privately that he should give up his
parliamentary seat.
Members of Mr Kanemaru's faction have been meeting over the past three days
to discuss his plight, and it is clear that senior members see the present
turmoil as an opportunity to improve their own standing and challenge Mr
Ichiro Ozawa, the former party secretary-general and Mr Kanemaru's chosen
successor.
Meanwhile, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, has watched helplessly
from the sidelines. Reliant on Mr Kanemaru to raise the numbers necessary
for his appointment last year, he is unable to take action against him. Mr
Miyazawa's lack of leadership has been condemned in Japanese editorials,
while the LDP has been distracted from issues such as the ailing economy and
the troubled relationship with Russia.
When he first confessed in late August to taking the illegal funds, Mr
Kanemaru resigned as vice-president of the party and said he would resign as
chairman of the faction, which is the more powerful of the two positions.
But he has since been encouraged to keep that position for fear that his
departure would create a bitter fight for control of the faction.
However, fighting has anyway erupted within the faction, as senior officials
opposed to Mr Ozawa's 'arrogant' management style have attempted to blame
him for the problems faced by the 'godfather'. At the same time, public
demands for Mr Kanemaru's resignation have failed to dissipate.
The Mainichi Shimbun, a leading Japanese daily newspaper, has opened an
'action line' to encourage readers to complain. A 54-year-old real estate
agent warned that 'the administrators of justice, the politicians and
organised crime' have been co-operating with each other and 'we can't let
this situation continue'.
A 57-year-old housewife said she was 'disillusioned' by the handling of Mr
Kanemaru's case, and suggested the Social Democratic Party, the leading
opposition party, had been cowardly. The SDP is reluctant to get involved in
the dispute because its own members have received illegal funds from the
same parcel delivery company, Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin.
