Four patrons watching "The Godfather Part III" in a Valley Stream, N.Y., 
theater, were shot Tuesday night, one fatally, by two groups of young men who 
argued over noise. 
</P>
<P>
Nassau County police described the groups as "heavily armed gangs" of from five 
to 10 each, one group sitting in the front row and the other near the back of 
the Sunrise Cinema Multiplex, located on Long Island near the New York City 
border. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the panicked audience of about 600 fled for their lives as the two 
gangs opened fire on each other, about 20 minutes into the R-rated movie set in 
the world of the Mafia. The groups apparently missed their adversaries, but hit 
four bystanders in the crossfire, including the 15-year-old who died. Another 
victim was shot in the left eye. Police said 12 to 25 shots were fired from 
three automatic weapons, two handguns and other weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the exact nature of the argument," a police spokesman said. "The 
altercation escalated into almost a physical battle before the shooting began." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the theater has a history of violence, with eight serious incidents 
reported in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
In Hollywood, at Mann's Chinese Theater, a teen-age boy suffered a seizure 
during the 4:15 p.m. showing and the film had to be stopped while paramedics 
arrived. A theater spokesman said that the interruption caused subsequent movie 
times to be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
Business was reported brisk at many theaters. At the Cineplex Odeon Universal 
City, one patron, Duane Tudahl, said he and friends arrived at 2 p.m. and 
waited 45 minutes to buy a ticket. But the earliest available showing they 
could buy for was 7 p.m. DAVID J. FOX
