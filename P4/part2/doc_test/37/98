<P>
KCET Channel 28, with strong support from a dance program, stepped ahead of the 
competition at the 42nd annual Los Angeles Area Emmy Awards presented Saturday 
by the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
The public television station captured 14 Emmys to lead the field. It was 
boosted by "ISO Dance Theatre," which won five statuettes, including honors for 
best performers and entertainment programming. 
</P>
<P>
Other multiple winners at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium show for KCET were the 
series "Take Five: Arts and Culture" with three awards and "By the Year 2000" 
with two. 
</P>
<P>
KCBS Channel 2 and KABC Channel 7 earned 10 Emmys apiece, while KNBC took the 
prize for best regularly scheduled daily news program among its eight trophies. 
</P>
<P>
The KCBS news department accounted for six Emmys with wins in the categories of 
spot news ("San Bernardino Pipeline Explosion"), news writers and investigative 
reporting ("Gang God-fathers"), mini-documentaries ("Children Are Dying"), live 
coverage of an unscheduled news event ("Wind Storms"), and camera crew -- hard 
news breaking story ("Emergency Rooms"). 
</P>
<P>
KABC newscasts picked up five Emmys as the station tied KCBS for live coverage 
of an unscheduled news event ("Earthquake Remote -- Santa Cruz") and also won 
for instructional series ("Drugbusters"), commentary by Bill Press, film/tape 
editors of hard news programs ("Puppy Mills") and film/tape editors of news 
features ("Thrill Rides"). 
</P>
<P>
Two of four Emmys bestowed on KABC's "Eye on L.A." were for information segment 
("Guns") and special class -- program area. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the best daily newscast award, KNBC's news department won for feature 
reporting ("Mono Lake"), mini-documentaries ("Red Dawn") -- in a tie with KCBS 
-- and camera crew -- news feature ("Town 4 cSale"). "Fred Roggin's Sports Bowl 
'89" was named best sports special and his "Sunday Night Sports" segment titled 
"Morganna" was an unlikely victor in the category of sports reporting. 
</P>
<P>
On accepting his Emmy for the lighthearted feature about Morganna Roberts, the 
buxom blond notorious for kissing professional athletes, straight-faced 
producer Jeff Hoffman said, "Listen closely -- you'll be able to hear the sound 
of hell freezing over." 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the evening's winners were KTLA with five awards, KCAL with four, 
KTTV with two and KLCS and Continental Cable with one each. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Meyers, the versatile KCAL broadcaster whose 56-year career began with 
radio station KFAC in 1944, received the prestigious Governors Award.
