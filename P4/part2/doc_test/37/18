Lights, Camera . . . Cue the Speaker: Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said the 
single line he speaks in Francis Ford Coppola's upcoming "Godfather III" is 
"sufficient for my (movie) debut." The San Francisco Democrat spent a long 
weekend in Rome doing a scene with Al Pacino. Brown was hired when Coppola told 
the actor originally chosen for the part of a black politician, "Why can't you 
act more like Willie Brown?" and then demanded: "Get me Willie Brown!" Asked if 
his career is following the reverse course of an actor named Ronald Reagan, 
Brown replied, "If I could be as successful, I wouldn't mind it." CLAUDIA PUIG
