Photo, AROUND THE WESTSIDE SAND AND SEA CLUB in Santa Monica sits on the site 
of the former Marion Davies estate, built for her by William Randolph Hearst in 
1929. The main house, once the largest, most luxurious beach house on the 
Pacific Coast, was demolished in 1957. Of the original estate, only a guest 
house that Davies had built for her sister remains and is now a city landmark. 
It was designed by architect Julia Morgan, who also did Hearst's San Simeon 
castle and the former Los Angeles Herald Examiner building in downtown Los 
Angeles.
