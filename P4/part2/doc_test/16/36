<P>
Catch a ghost. Greet a ghoul. Hear vampires read their bloody prose. All Hallow 
Even is nigh and the Southland is spooked with events fun and fearsome. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Undead Poet's Society 
</P>
<P>
The room is dark. A white-faced ghoul in deadly black reads poetry by 
candelabra-light. Her guests sip wine, blood red, and listen in silence as 
shadows dance on every wall. 
</P>
<P>
This is the "Undead Poet's Society," sponsored by the Los Angeles Poetry 
Festival and featuring readings "by and about vampires." Poets scheduled to 
read include Monica Brett Serle, Joel Marsden, Marguerite Garner, Chet 
Henseley, and Denise Dumars, "who has published extensively in the vampire 
vein," according to Meg Reed. Reed is producer of the event and a 
self-proclaimed 487-year-old vampire. 
</P>
<P>
"Vampires are very romantic," said Dumars, who writes of alabaster necks, the 
living dead and wolves' night cries. "They are part of a romantic fantasy. To 
describe them, we must think up the strangest things." 
</P>
<P>
The poets will articulate such things in a cobwebbed room in a darkened corner 
of the Fullerton Museum. "All performers will be dressed to kill," promised 
Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Museum, 301 N. Pomona, Fullerton. Saturday, 8-10 p.m. $5. 
Information: (714) 433-5972 or (714) 679-2394.

Rude Dog Halloween Contest 
</P>
<P>
Rude or polite, terriers, golden retrievers, pit bulls and mixed shepherds will 
be dressed for largess at the "Rude Dog Halloween Contest." More than 100 
canines are expected to vie for top prizes of stuffed animals, T-shirts, mugs, 
visors and pencils. "We're looking for dogs with attitude," said contest 
organizer Joanne Thomson. 
</P>
<P>
"All contestants must be vaccinated and on a leash," said Thomson, who warned 
that masks, sharp objects and spray paint on bodies will not be permitted. A $5 
entry fee for all contestants will be donated to Canine Companions, a nonprofit 
organization that trains dogs to assist disabled individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Dog food, biscuits, shampoo and trick-or-treat bags will be distributed to all 
contestants. A howling-good time is promised.

Grave Line Tours 
</P>
<P>
"Dearly Beloved," begins a sinister voice as an unseen organ intones "The 
Funeral March," "you are about to view the remains of 80 of Hollywood's 
spookiest and kookiest attractions, most of which were dug up exclusively for 
this tour." 
</P>
<P>
So begins Grave Line's two-hour hearse tour of scenes of "death, sins, 
scandals, murders, suicides" that allegedly occurred in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's meticulously researched and very amusing," said Paul Hodges, 31, a London 
investment analyst, hearse-bound for the second time. "You've got to have some 
sense of humor to ride around in one of these, I believe." 
</P>
<P>
Mourners/tour-goers visit the death sites of notables like Janice Joplin, 
Truman Capote, Jean Harlow, William (Fred Mertz) Frawley and Carmen Miranda. A 
morning-suited driver reels off epitaphs, anecdotes and lurid Hollywood trivia 
between stops. 
</P>
<P>
Grave Line Tours is run by Greg Smith, 38, a former mortuary-academy student 
turned entrepreneur. "When I read biographies of the stars," said Smith, "I'd 
always turn to the end to see how they died." 
</P>
<P>
 Tours depart at dead noon from the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Orchid 
Avenue (the East wall of the Chinese Theater). Daily. $30 per person. 
Information: (213) 876-0920. Reservations: (213) 876-4286.

Knott's Scary Farm 
</P>
<P>
This fog-shrouded ghost town is home to 500 professionally costumed ghouls and 
goblins. The wind whistles a ghostly chorale as spirits roam the streets, 
leaping out at startled mortals. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning at 7 each night, Knott's Berry Farm is transformed into "Knott's 
Scary Farm," a nether world of werewolves, skeletons, Frankenstein Brides and 
zombies. Included in the frightdom are a ghostly train ride into the Threshold 
of Doom; a Psycho-inspired Uncle Ernie's Madhouse, where sadistic clowns twirl 
butcher knives, and Revenge of the Dead, a maze where preternatural gangsters, 
monsters and pirates terrorize passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
For those nights the farm is in its scary state, parents are asked not to bring 
children under the age of 13. 
</P>
<P>
According to Stuart Zanville, the farm's publicity director, as many as 200,000 
people are expected to attend the 10-day event. "We believe this to be the 
largest Halloween party in the world," said Zanville. 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's Berry Farm, 8039 Beach Blvd., Buena Park. Today, Sunday, Tuesday and 
Halloween: 7 p.m.-1 a.m.; Friday: 7 p.m.-2 a.m. $22 advance purchase; $25 (day 
of event). Information: (714) 740-2000, (805) 583-8700 or (619) 278-TIXS. Not 
recommended for children under 13.

Queen Mary "Room With a Boo" 
</P>
<P>
Is the Queen Mary haunted? Do ghosts really appear in her staterooms and boiler 
rooms? Starting Friday and continuing through Halloween night, private 
90-minute tours will take Queen Mary hotel guests into the most secluded areas 
of the ship -- where ghostly sightings allegedly have taken place. 
</P>
<P>
Tour-goers are handed flashlights, then led by a guide in captain's garb 
through darkened corridors and deserted operations rooms. Lights are lowered; 
ghost stories are retold. 
</P>
<P>
Featured on the tour is a former 1940s children's playroom, where ghostly 
crying can still be heard; a poolroom, where two women specters have appeared 
to ship employees, and the engine room, where an 18-year-old crewman lost his 
life . . . and purportedly reappeared in uniform 20 years later. 
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of the tour, guests enjoy a Halloween dessert reception in 
the Capstan and a good night's sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Queen Mary, southernmost point of 710 Freeway, Pier J, Long Beach. Friday 
through Halloween; four tours nightly, beginning at 7 p.m. $110 per hotel room.

American Commerce National Bank "Pumpkin Poll" 
</P>
<P>
This could be the scariest event of all. 
</P>
<P>
At least 40 "Dianne Feinstein" and "Pete Wilson" pumpkins will be carved by the 
Anaheim bank's employees during its "Second Pumpkin Poll." Employees are asked 
to represent their choice for governor in carvings "silly to sublime." Pumpkin 
votes will be tallied and a projected winner announced on Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
"Keep in mind we are in Orange County and that gives us a kind of tilt," said 
bank Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gerald Garner. "But we expect to come 
pretty close percentage-wise." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, bank employees carved Michael Dukakis and George Bush pumpkins to 
represent their choices for President. An air-brushed green pumpkin of George 
Bush received highest honors. "The outside layer of skin was removed. It looked 
very realistic," recalled Garner. "And we came very close statistically (to the 
election results)." 
</P>
<P>
 American Commerce National Bank lobby, 3800 E. La Palma Blvd., Anaheim. Oct. 
31, 9:30 a.m.-4 p.m. Free. Information: (714) 630-4500.
