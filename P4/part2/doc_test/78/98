  [Text] Can the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] overcome 
the stagnation in Bulgarian-Russian relations? At first glance 
the answer is no. There are several reasons for this. The SDS 
coalition is not in power and does have the necessary levers to 
directly affect official relations with the Kremlin. The 
natural anti-Soviet tendencies among the supporters of the blue 
[SDS] coalition are interpreted in Moscow by some "well-wishers" 
as hatred for the Russian people. The current government is the 
hostage of business groups that rely on the chaotic interstate 
relations and the paralysis of the Bulgarian Embassy in Moscow, 
in which there has been no ambassador for the last two years, in 
order to monopolize trade with the former USSR. The suspicion 
that KGB structures played an active role in toppling Filip 
Dimitrov's government is well-grounded. 
  Recently, however, one could also observe different 
processes. They provide certain commentators sensitive to 
Bulgarian-Russian relations with an opportunity to assume that 
we could soon see a sharp change in those relations. It is not 
very plausible to assume that the Bulgarian neocommunists will 
play a fundamental role in this process. Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin clearly implied this last year, when he refused to 
receive Bulgarian Prime Minister Lyuben Berov. This was a 
diplomatic slap in the face not only for the government of the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] and the Movement for Rights and 
Freedoms [DPS], but mainly for President Zhelev, who is Berov's 
patron. 
  It was only the SDS that issued a fundamental position 
against the participants in the coup against Yeltsin, when the 
Russian Parliament was dissolved. This was done without waiting 
for a favorable outcome of the events. A bit later reports 
emerged about unofficial contacts between SDS figures and 
Yeltsin's advisers. Last week it became clear that the talks on 
Filip Dimitrov's visit to Russia have made progress. We also 
learned that intelligence chief Brigo Asparukhov visited Moscow 
with the purpose of foiling the contacts between the blue 
coalition and Russia's liberal circles. 
  After the failure of this mission (General Asparukhov was 
recalled to Bulgaria on 21 January before the end of his visit), 
three other persons who are very close to President Zhelev -- 
Ivan Krustev, Deyan Kyuranov, and Evgeniy Daynov -- departed for 
Moscow. It is indicative that on this occasion the president 
sent more intelligent advisers who do not hide a certain 
sympathy for the SDS and its leader. 
  Will Dimitrov succeed in making a new beginning in 
Bulgarian-Russian relations? One should first answer the main 
question: Is the "northern bear" prepared to seek friendship 
this time rather than control? For the time being everything is 
in the realm of initial positive signals. However, it is clear 
that the democrats in both countries already understand that the 
stagnation in the two countries' relations serves only the 
forces of restoration and organized crime.
