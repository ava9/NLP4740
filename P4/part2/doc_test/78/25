  [Text] The DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms] wants 
[Transportation] Minister Kiril Ermenkov, [Agriculture] Minister 
Georgi Tanev, and Forestry Committee Chairman Khristo Todorov to 
be replaced. Our reporter Mariya Tsankova obtained this 
information from unofficial sources before the end of today's 
session of the DPS Central Council. 
  According to information from within the BSP [Bulgarian 
Socialist Party], the Socialists are calling for the replacement 
of Ministers Karabashev, Bikov, and Valentin Aleksandrov [of 
trade, industry and defense]; the New Alliance for Democracy 
reportedly wanted one of their number appointed foreign minister. 
  At today's Central Council meeting, Kadir Kadir proposed 
Khristo Totev for deputy prime minister if there is a cabinet 
reshuffle. The DPS maintained its view on the need for a major 
government reshuffle, but declares that if the cabinet falls it 
will join in the lottery for distributing candidates for cabinet 
posts between the parliamentary political forces. 
  According to BTA, DPS leader Ahmed Dogan said after his 
meeting with Lyuben Berov that the prime minister was in 
excellent health. Professor Berov has still not reached a final 
decision on possible cabinet changes. Everything is at the 
stage of taking soundings in the parliamentary groups, but by 
the end of the week he will probably have formed a clear idea on 
structural changes, Dogan said.
