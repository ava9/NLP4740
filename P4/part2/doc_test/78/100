  [Text] Sofia, January 12 (BTA) -- "Bulgaria agrees with 
the U.S. Partnership for Peace initiative and will shortly 
accept the invitation to enter into a Partnership for Peace 
contract," the Bulgarian president's spokesman told reporters 
today after a working meeting between Dr. Zhelev and senior 
national security officials was held to coordinate Bulgaria's 
stand on cooperation with NATO. This stand will be set forth 
tomorrow by President Zhelev to Ambassador Madeleine Albright, 
special envoy of U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  At Dr. Zhelev's invitation, the meeting was attended by 
Prime 
Minister Lyuben Berov, Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of 
General Staff of the Bulgarian Army, Foreign Minister Stanislav 
Daskalov, Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov, Interior 
Minister Viktor Mikhaylov, Nikolay Slatinski, chairman of the 
National Assembly Committee on National Security, and Yunal 
Lyutfi, who is chairing the national security on foreign policy 
[as received]. 
  At the meeting it was decided that President Zhelev will 
sign 
the documents on behalf of Bulgaria, Prime Minister Berov told 
the press. When it meets on Monday [17 January], the cabinet 
will discuss this decision and will form a working group to 
draft a proposal for Bulgaria's participation in Partnership for 
Peace and the actual contractual arrangement. 
  "We had no differences at all and concurred on the 
conclusion 
that Bulgaria meets the political requirements to join 
Partnership for Peace and must not lose momentum because this is 
a way to prove our earnest intentions of integrating into the 
Euro-Atlantic security architecture," Mr. Slatinski told the 
press. 
  On December 21, 1993 the National Assembly voted a 
declaration on relations between Bulgaria and NATO. The MP's 
[members of parliament] declared themselves in favour of making 
use of the opportunities for cooperation with the North Atlantic 
Alliance. 
  On January 11, the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry declared 
Bulgaria's intention of joining the Partnership for Peace 
Initiative. 
  The government Press Office today denied an allegation of 
Mr. 
Asparukh Panov MP of the Union of Democratic Forces that the 
cabinet failed to take appropriate action for the circulation of 
the National Assembly declaration on the country's relations 
with NATO. 
  "I was not exactly surprised to learn about yet another 
slanderous story in the Bulgarian press about our diplomatic 
activities in Brussels," Mrs. Lea Koen, Bulgaria's ambassador in 
the Belgian capital, said on Radio Free Europe today. She was 
reacting to allegations of the KONTINENT daily that she delayed 
the circulation of the National Assembly declaration on 
Bulgaria's relations with NATO by mailing it instead of handing 
it personally to the leaders of the Alliance. According to Mrs. 
Koen, "certain people in the Foreign Ministry have made a 
practice of laying the blame at the wrong door."
