<F P=106> [Interview with Zhan Videnov, chairman of the Bulgarian </F>
Socialist Party Supreme Council, by Teodora Encheva; place and 
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Encheva] Mr. Videnov, do you want to be prime 
minister? 
  [Videnov] I want Bulgaria to have a lasting, efficient, and 
leftist-centrist government. I think that the voters will soon 
resolve this issue. I have often said that Bulgaria will hardly 
be an exception to the other East European countries, where the 
composition of leftist-centrist cabinets is formed after complex 
coalition negotiations that often have an unexpected or 
unconventional result. 
  [Encheva] I meant your personal ambition. 
  [Videnov] I have neither sick ambitions nor an inferiority 
complex. Both the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] and I could 
cope with such a challenge. [passage omitted] 
  [Encheva] Why did you sacrifice Georgi Pirinski as a member 
of the BSP Executive Bureau? You know that he will not work 
together with Doncho Konakchiev and Nikola Koychev. He 
repeatedly stated that their economic policy concepts are 
incompatible with his. Could you comment on him withdrawing his 
candidacy and resigning as deputy chairman of the BSP 
parliamentary faction? 
  [Videnov] Georgi Pirinski did not know the entire membership 
of the Executive Council, but he was informed about Doncho 
Konakchiev and Nikola Koychev. I am sure that this is not the 
reason he withdrew his candidacy. I rather think that his 
personal decision was influenced by the plenum's discussion, 
which showed that the new membership is firmly determined to 
implement the congress decisions regarding early elections in 
the fall. 
  [Encheva] Do you mean that Georgi Pirinski does not want 
elections? 
  [Videnov] Only he could answer this question. I think that 
his decision was influenced by certain economic measures that 
the cabinet and parliament are adopting now. They could produce 
a positive effect in the fall, if we have political stability. 
However, it would be an illusion to hope that things will 
proceed at a good pace in the legislative sphere. I would not 
dramatize his resignation from the post deputy chairman of the 
parliamentary faction, because he said that he wants to work in 
the Supreme Council organs, and as far as I am concerned, I will 
help him. [passage omitted] 
  [Encheva] Could you say when there will be elections? 
  [Videnov] The elections issue must be resolved this year. 
Theoretically, this proposal was already discussed by the BSP 
leadership last fall. Now we are certain that early elections 
will take place. 
  [Encheva] Prior to the congress you were more categorical 
regarding having the elections this fall.... 
  [Videnov] Technically, the end of October-beginning of 
November is the best time for elections. Afterward it will be 
too late to develop an election campaign, form a new cabinet, 
prepare the new budget, and so forth. Naturally, not all 
political forces take those criteria into consideration and 
surprises of all kinds are possible. Therefore, the degree to 
which one could be categorical is limited. [passage omitted] 
  [Encheva] Do you think that the influence of Aleksandur 
Lilov and Andrey Lukanov over you has decreased after the 41st 
BSP Congress? 
  [Videnov] The influence of noted BSP figures over party 
policy has always been implemented through their participation 
in the party's leading organs and not through the party chairman. 
  [Encheva] Do you think that Aleksandur Marinov will form an 
ideological current within the BSP, as he said in his STANDART 
NEWS interview? 
  [Videnov] No, I do not think that our ideological 
differences 
are that great. The BSP does not need a new ideological 
current. The time when inner party and personal problems were 
resolved in such a manner is over, therefore, I think that such 
a step has a very low probability. I think that this is rather 
intensified activity on the eve of the referendum on the party 
program. I assume that Mr. Marinov will be among the 
participants in the discussion related to the party program.
