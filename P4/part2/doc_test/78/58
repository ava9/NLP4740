  [Text] Sofia, May 31 (BTA) -- The anticommunist Union of 
Democratic Forces (SDS) today confirmed its boycott of 
parliament declared last week. The leaders of the coalition say 
the Constitution was violated when on May 13 parliament rejected 
the structural changes in the government moved by the prime 
minister, and the latter did not tender his resignation. 
Following a regular meeting of the leadership of the 
ex-communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), Doncho Konakchiev 
MP said he could not rule out the possibility of the Socialists 
moving a no-confidence vote in the cabinet. "It all depends on 
the cabinet's performance and meeting of commitments," he said. 
  "For the SDS it is beyond doubt the Lyuben Berov cabinet's 
staying in office violates constitutional order," SDS leader 
Filip Dimitrov told a press conference following a regular 
meeting of the SDS leadership. "The SDS decided to stand out 
against the attempt to trample on the Constitution and keep the 
government in power," he said. He said the coalition decided 
there was no reason for maintaining the status quo. The SDS 
MP's will not take part in plenary sittings. Dimitrov, however, 
said the faction will enter the debating chamber in new cases of 
violation of the Constitution. Asked if the SDS will take part 
in the passage of bankruptcy and scheme-of-arrangement laws, 
Dimitrov said decisions will be made for each individual case. 
The coalition will expand extraparliamentary activities, and 
calls rallies on the Persin Island (on the Danube) on June 4 and 
in Sofia on June 7. 
  Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and BSP floor leader Nora 
Ananieva today had a telephone conversation on parliament's 
legislative work. According to Chief BSP Press Officer Klara 
Marinova, the prime minister guaranteed he would personally take 
part in parliamentary debates on amendments to the Privatization 
Act, a BSP priority. 
  According to Konakchiev, BSP will urge parliament to discuss 
probable changes in the Constitution and a new election law 
before its summer recess. SDS leader Dimitrov said changes in 
the Constitution were a complex issue.
