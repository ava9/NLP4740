  [Text] On 21 February Zhan Videnov said that in addition 
to meeting the visiting Russian parliamentarians as Bulgarian 
Socialist parliamentarians, the two delegations also had 
unofficial contacts at the party level. Apparently next week 
there will be a meeting of Russia's leftist parties in which the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] will take part. On the Russian 
side, the meeting will be attended by the Socialist Labor Party, 
Rybkin's Agrarian Party of Russia [APR], and the "Free Russia" 
People's Party [as published]. Our Socialists hope that other 
CIS countries will also participate in the meeting. 
  The Socialists' active contacts with congenial parties in 
Serbia, Greece, and Russia, where those parties rule, could 
hardly be reduced to attempts on the part of the Bulgarian 
Socialists to overcome the difficulties along the road to 
Europe. There is a present danger that the BSP could monopolize 
a part of our foreign policy. This evokes an even greater 
concern against the background of the different views of the 
political parties in our country in anything related to foreign 
policy elements. 
  It is true that National Assembly Chairman and the Movement 
for Rights and Freedoms [DPS] also received official invitations 
to visit Russia. On 21 February deputies of the Union of 
Democratic Forces [SDS] said that they also have been invited, 
but for the time being they consider their invitation as 
unofficial. In principle, the SDS was interested in 
strengthening relations with Russia, but for the time being 
there was no adequate program, [SDS deputy] Asparukh Panov said 
on 21 February. The main foreign policy expert of the blue 
coalition [SDS] did not hide his concern with the independent 
foreign policy tunnels the BSP is tracing. He noted that the 
BSP's foreign policy activity is becoming ever more intensive 
and that this hardly contributes to a uniform Bulgarian foreign 
policy. 
  Bulgarian tax payers noted a long time ago that there is no 
uniform Bulgarian foreign policy. If the president is closer to 
the SDS doctrine, the premier undoubtedly professes the BSP's 
doctrine. However, since according to the Constitution, there 
are two foreign policy centers in Bulgaria, it is reasonable to 
expect their chiefs to clarify the direction in which the wind 
blows. One could hardly doubt the fact that we need good 
economic and political relations with Russia. The question is 
to what extend we will be able to defend our independence and 
equality in our relations with Russia, something that the two 
centers, or at least one of them, apparently cannot guarantee. 
It cannot be natural that the political force with the greatest 
influence in our country -- the SDS -- does not have direct 
contacts with a great power such as Russia. Such relations 
would certainly introduce a new tone in international relations, 
which will break out of the narrow party track in which the 
Socialists pushed them through their monopoly.
