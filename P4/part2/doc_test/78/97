  [Text] Sofia, April 7 (BTA) -- Following consultations 
with the parliamentary groups, Prime Minister Lyuben Berov next 
week will announce his plans about cabinet changes, reads a 
government press release this afternoon. Prof. Berov this 
morning chaired a regular government sitting resuming his duties 
after a 26-day sick leave and a major heart operation. While he 
declined to make any comments before journalists, photographers 
were allowed to take pictures. 
  The prospective cabinet changes will be aimed at fulfilling 
priority cabinet tasks to carry out privatization, combat 
corruption, conclude agreements with the international financial 
institutions, expand this country's international ties, protect 
Bulgarian business and revise its social policy in favour of a 
wide strata of the population. The ministries, too, are 
expected to specify and publicize the steps they will take by 
year-end to carry out these tasks, the release also said. 
  The better part of the release responds to criticism against 
the Cabinet by President Zhelyu Zhelev. On Saturday, April 2, 
Dr. Zhelev sharply criticized the Cabinet for bringing reforms 
to a standstill, declaring the withdrawal of his support for 
them. "The incumbent cabinet suits the Bulgarian Socialist 
Party (BSP, the former Communists), as it gives them a chance to 
do what they've always wanted to do, govern without shouldering 
the political responsibility for it," the president then said. 
Meeting with the leader of one of Bulgaria's major labour 
organizations, the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in 
Bulgaria, President Zhelev reiterated he no longer supported the 
cabinet and predicted early elections would be held this autumn. 
  Though asked by the press to respond to last Saturday's (92 
April] criticism, Berov would not do it, "to avert a further 
straining of relations between the cabinet and president, which 
some would see as a war between the two institutions". The 
government Press Office release describes the arguments in the 
presidential attack as emotional, farfetched and one-sided. The 
release describes as baseless the presidential charge that being 
responsible for the dollar and price rise in the last month, the 
government has endangered civil peace and social stability. 
"This was an insufficiently considered move", says the release. 
It accuses President Zhelev of sometimes trying to turn into a 
supporter of some political force or other. "It is inadmissible 
for the president to declare confidence or no confidence in any 
government. This is a function of the parliament. Presidential 
attempts to change the parliamentary lineup are unconstitutional 
and recall some old-fashioned non-republican ways in Bulgarian 
history", says the release. The prime minister is far from 
thinking that his government is ideal and has fulfilled all its 
promises, the release also says. Yet only a nonpartisan 
government of national responsibility can rule this country in 
the present complicated and extremely controversial lineup, with 
no parliamentary force commanding a clear majority. 
  The release refutes the president's criticism for the forex 
[foreign exchange] crisis, arguing that the cabinet cannot be 
held responsible for forex policy, as this is a responsibility 
of the central Bulgarian National Bank subordinate to 
parliament. It says the president gave twice smaller figures on 
the land reform. "It should be clear that legislature also has 
a commitment to the land reform to fulfill, and that legislation 
assigns a significant role to judiciary at this stage", says the 
release. In connection with criticism of the low progress of 
privatization, the release recalls that the government-sponsored 
amendments to the Privatization Act have been stalled in 
parliament for over seven months. According to the release, it 
is an exaggeration to speak of a disastrous price rise on the 
home market. "We are witnessing the emergence of a market 
economy and rising private enterprise that the government should 
support, by passing the necessary laws, in the interest of the 
nation and not against it. Any other type of thinking is 
retrograde and seeks to play on the real hardships of ordinary 
Bulgarians", says the release. In conclusion, the release 
expresses a hope that "the president's overstatement on Saturday 
is not so much a conviction as a suggestion by advisers on and 
off his payroll".
