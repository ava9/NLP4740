<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Mariya Tsenkova from the National </F>
Assembly] 
  [Text] This is an Assembly session that will be decisive 
for the government. At the beginning of today's session Filip 
Dimitrov, leader of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], made a 
statement on behalf of his faction in which he asked Prime 
Minister Berov to resign. An attempt to repeat the 
no-confidence vote will be viewed by the SDS deputies as a 
violation of the Constitution. If this is allowed it will 
represent a danger for Bulgaria's democracy, Dimitrov said. 
  Replying to the statement, Velko Vulkanov of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP] demanded that the 19 May vote on 
structural and personnel changes in the government be annulled, 
and asked National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov to 
resign for what Vulkanov described as a violation of 
parliamentary practice. 
  BSL leader Zhan Videnov assured the hall -- the SDS deputies 
and Aleksandur Yordanov had already walked out -- that there 
will be a debate on the draft resolution proposed by the 
government on a framework agreement with parliament. 
  The political forces that support the cabinet are now 
holding 
consultations at the invitation of Prime Minister Berov, who 
still has not come to the National Assembly. It appears that 
the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS] will participate in 
the consultations. The deputies of the New Alliance for 
Democracy [NSD] are divided. Part of them will probably 
participate in the consultations, while others demand separate 
talks with the prime minister.
