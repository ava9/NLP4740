<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Nikolay Vasilev, chairman of the </F>
Alternative Social Liberal Party, by Elizabet Dafinova; place 
and date not given: "We Will Not Support a Government With a 
`Pirinski' Program"] 
  [Text] [Dafinova] Professor Vasilev, does the ASP 
[Alternative Social Liberal Party] feel the DPS [Movement for 
Rights and Freedoms] has deceived it, after everything that has 
happened? 
  [Vasilev] One cannot compare interparty relations with 
relations between personalities. Nevertheless, I would like to 
say that the joint meeting of the NSD [New Alliance for 
Democracy] and DPS parliamentary group decided to walk out of 
parliament if Prof. Berov starts talking about specific 
structural changes but then fails to do anything about it. I 
think it is senseless for us to meet and adopt decisions if they 
are not fulfilled. 
  [Dafinova] What will [Industry] Minister Bikov do now? Will 
he follow Karabashev, as the ASP has recommended, or will he 
rely on someone else's support -- perhaps the DPS? 
  [Vasilev] Minister Bikov's seat is firm. If he wants to 
stay in the cabinet, it is certain he will do so. However, if 
the government fails to change its formula and its economic 
policy, we will not only withdraw our support, but will also 
cease to take part in the government. From this point on, the 
problem is a personal one. Bikov must decide himself what to do. 
  [Dafinova] At the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] rally on 1 
May, Zhan Videnov said that he gives this cabinet another 30-40 
days. Some people drew a connection with Valentin Karabashev's 
gesture and predict that the ex-deputy prime minister will be 
the next prime minister. Is this possible? With whose support 
will this happen, with the help of the BSP? 
  [Vasilev] Naturally, Valentin Karabashev may become the next 
prime minister, but it may also be someone else. As far as I am 
concerned, this government is already finished. The government 
that we supported until now was different, with a different 
program. We will not support a government with a "Pirinski" 
program. I hope the DPS will also understand this, that it is 
not merely a matter of certain personnel changes, but of changes 
in the government's policies. The government has started 
carrying out a communist economic program. The Communists' 
claims have gone beyond all reason. 
  [Dafinova] Nonetheless, is the ASP considering continuing 
its talks about the cabinet with the other political forces? 
  [Vasilev] The NSD parliamentary group has reached a firm 
decision that from now on it will not negotiate with either the 
BSP or Berov's government. We will hold the door open only for 
the DPS and SDS, and for the individual SDS parties, of course.
