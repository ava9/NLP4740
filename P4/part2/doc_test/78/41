<F P=106> [Report by Iva Toncheva and Kiril Vulchev: "SDS To Boycott </F>
Parliament Until It Opts For Elections"] 
  [Text] Sofia, June 21 (BTA) -- The anti-communist Union of 
Democratic Forces (SDS) will continue its month-old boycott of 
parliament until the National Assembly "clearly demonstrates a 
will for the initiation of elections this autumn." In a special 
address circulated this afternoon, the SDS National Coordinating 
Council (top political leadership) calls for united action on 
all democratic forces sharing the SDS principles and policy 
documents. 
  For more than a year and a half now, the SDS has been trying 
in vain to precipitate early general elections (regular 
elections are due in the autumn of 1995). At its congress in 
early June, the ex- communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) 
declared itself in favour of elections this coming autumn. 
Extraparliamentary parties are also clamouring for early 
elections. On May 26, the Lyuben Berov Cabinet was voted 
confidence by parliament on the strength of a programme which 
covers the period ending this September. On May 20, parliament 
voted down the structural cabinet changes proposed by the prime 
minister. The SDS saw Prof. Berov's refusal to resign in the 
wake of the latter vote as a violation of the constitution which 
illegitimizes the government. The SDS petitioned the 
Constitutional Court to rule on the matter. The Court's ruling 
was announced today. According to it, the prime minister need 
not resign when parliament votes down any cabinet changes he may 
move. 
  SDS Filip Dimitrov and BSP leader Zhan Videnov met yesterday 
to discuss ways of achieving early elections. They, however, 
failed to reach agreement. "SDS warns of the danger of turning 
the Bulgarian Parliament, controlled by BSP and its satellites, 
into a machine for recommunization of the country and for 
relapse into the methods of the half-century-old communist 
dictatorship," today's SDS address says. The coalition sees 
elections as the only way out. The union remains committed to 
the position, reaffirmed at its latest national conference in 
May, that it will not take part in the formation of a new 
government within the lifetime of the incumbent parliament. 
  BSP leader Zhan Videnov says SDS would not provide 
guarantees 
of early parliamentary elections. "The intra-coalition problems 
which are taking the upper hand in the SDS deny it the 
possibility to implement flexible and pragmatic policy and that 
is why the resolutions of the SDS National Conference are 
followed blindly," the BSP leader emphasized.
