<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Videnov's Feint Will Be Assessed </F>
in Fall"] 
  [Text] Formally, the 41st Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] 
Congress ended according to expectations. 
  Zhan Videnov was reelected. The adoption of the program was 
postponed and subjected to a party referendum -- as the chairman 
demanded. The congress announced a course toward new elections. 
  However, unlike previous forums, events that ostensibly did 
not occur at the congress prompt the observers to conclude that 
nevertheless, something happened in the BSP. The personnel 
changes were the most insignificant development. 
  According to the forecasts the greatest battle at the 
congress should have taken place in anything related to the 
election of the BSP Supreme Council. No major changes were 
anticipated. However, Andrey Lukanov, Dimitur Yonchev, Rosen 
Karadimov, and Elena Poptodorova surprisingly were not elected 
to this organ. 
  However, the most improbable development was the failure of 
Aleksandur Marinov, seen as the probable next party leader, to 
gain election to the Supreme Council. He was supported by the 
BSP Sofia city organization and Aleksandur Lilov himself. 
However, Marinov could not even qualify as a contender for the 
post of BSP leader. 
  Thus the coup at the top of the party that was planned, did 
not take place. According to the laws of the party hierarchy, 
from now on the process will follow the domino rule -- other 
people will also have to leave the higher floors of the building 
on Positano Street [the BSP headquarters]. 
  It was in the issue of the party program that Videnov's 
victory became obvious. 
  The party chief strategist [Aleksandur Lilov] was burdened 
by 
his program. This was not a strategic burden. He clearly had no 
direct commitment to the party leadership. However, isolated in 
his strategic center, he composed a program that he saw as 
certain to be adopted at the congress. Surprising or not, Zhan 
Videnov convincingly defended his position during the debate and 
in the final analysis he achieved what he wanted -- the BSP 
program will be adopted not by the congress but by a party 
referendum. 
  To be able to assess this victory of Videnov on merit one 
should know that Lilov's center worked for two years on its 
variant of the program and thought that there would be no 
competition. However, two additional competitors appeared -- 
the draft programs of the Alliance for Social Democracy and the 
hardliners of the "Marxist Alternative." 
  However, at the referendum the party members will not be 
asked to select one of the three drafts. They will actually vote 
on Lilov's program, which will be amended and supplemented. It 
is assumed that the amendments will include the elimination of 
the democratic socialism line, proposed by the strategist. Thus 
Videnov, who opposes this formula, will achieve another victory. 
  There is an additional goal behind all this. When Zhan 
Videnov imposed the decision on the referendum his secret 
intention was related to preparing the BSP position at the next 
elections. The people around him clearly hinted that the concept 
of democratic socialism stinks and scares the potential allies 
of the BSP in a preelection and postelection coalition. 
  The talks with Petur Dertliev's Social Democrats are at an 
advanced phase. However, one of the conditions of forming the 
partnership is very categorical -- the Socialists should 
relinquish Lilov's yearnings, and declare themselves Social 
Democrats. 
  Videnov's feint in delaying his reply to this demand could 
turn out to be rather prudent. However, this will become clear 
only at the next elections. 
  The BSP Congress approved the idea of holding early 
parliamentary elections in the fall. This was not by accident 
and is not a meaningless demonstration on the party of Videnov. 
He wants the elections and has his reasons. The BSP leader 
firmly declared that this parliament had exhausted its 
possibilities. However, his secret concern is related to new 
changes at the National Assembly, which could be uncomfortable 
for the Socialists. If Lyuben Berov remains in power, the chance 
of the anticommunist majority in the parliament to organize 
itself and form a new cabinet improves. 
  In addition Videnov is convinced that, if the elections take 
place in the fall, the BSP will win them. 
  Nevertheless, the BSP parliamentary faction does not 
unequivocally accept the idea of new elections. Nora Ananieva 
[leader of the BSP parliamentary faction] pretended that she was 
joking when she said at the congress that fall ends on 22 
December. Despite the fact that the Socialists unanimously 
declare their wish to hold new elections, not all of them want 
to risk their seats in the parliament. 
  The problem of the Socialists' leader is whether the Union 
of 
Democratic Forces [SDS] really wants new elections, as it has 
claimed for a long time, or whether this is a strategic maneuver 
of the SDS center. The concern grew even more when the SDS 
National Coordinating Council praised the BSP for finally 
adopting the idea the SDS constantly promotes. The SDS became 
even more suspicious after the scandal between Filip Dimitrov 
and Stefan Savov, which could possibly lead toward preserving 
the parliament. 
  Difficult times lie ahead for the BSP. Lukanov, who appeared 
to be a permanent fixture, is outside the supreme leadership. 
Lilov obviously suffered a defeat. However, will all this be 
enough to convince the voters that the BSP is not the Bulgarian 
Communist Party any longer?
