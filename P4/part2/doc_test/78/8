<F P=106> [From BTA's 19 May "Press Review"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Sofia, May 19 (BTA) -- "Prime Minister Stuns 
Parliament" (the trade union daily TRUD), "Prime Minister Gets 
Mixed Up Kicking His Own Chair" (ZEMEDELSKO ZNAME, the daily of 
the Bulgarian Agrarian Party), "MP's to Boycott Berov's Cabinet 
Overhaul" (the private daily STANDART NEWS), "Berov May Fall 
Today" (the private daily 24 CHASA) -- this is a sample of 
newspapers front-page headlines on Prime Minister Lyuben Berov's 
proposals for structural and personnel changes to the cabinet 
which he unveiled in parliament yesterday. Prof. Berov read his 
proposals at the beginning of debates on the sixth vote of no 
confidence in his cabinet the parliamentary Union of Democratic 
Forces (SDS) moved for last week. The no confidence motion is 
to be put to the vote after 18:00 hrs today. 
  The private daily OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK stresses that "the New 
Union for Democracy (NSD, set up by breakaways and expelees from 
the parliamentary SDS), and the ethnic Turks' Movement for 
Rights and Freedoms (DPS, on whose mandate the incumbent cabinet 
was formed at the end of 1992), have withdrawn their political 
and parliamentary support for Prime Minister Berov." "The 
problem is whether the NSD and DPS joint declaration is mere 
words or actual intention," a signed commentary in the same 
daily says. 
  Citing Socialists, the SDS daily DEMOKRATSIYA writes that 
the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) is expected to adopt a decision 
on toppling Prof. Berov and his cabinet at a plenum today. 
  "It is worth talking about a new cabinet if some six million 
Bulgarians have their say on it first", the socialist daily DUMA 
writes referring to a statement by BSP leader Zhan Videnov. 
Commenting on the NSD-DPS joint declaration, Mr. Videnov said 
that "the two parliamentary groups refuse to give credit to 
Lyuben Berov after he fulfilled all their wishes". 
  TRUD predicts that Prof. Berov's Cabinet will be succeeded 
by 
a government formed by centrist forces -- the DPS, the NSD, the 
independent MP's and the Civil Alliance for the Republic (GOR, 
part of whose members broke away from the BSP). Prof. Todor 
Vulchev, governor of the Bulgarian National Bank, is expected to 
head the new cabinet, the paper writes. The MP's' unwillingness 
to dissolve themselves before the expiry of their term is a 
guarantee for the appointment of a new cabinet, the paper says 
adding that the centrists and the moderate in the SDS and the 
BSP are expected to conclude an agreement. 
  "The SDS and the BSP would better admit that the bogging 
down 
of reform and the disintegration of the state is their fault, 
and not the fault of that cabinet of figure-heads," a signed 
commentary in 24 CHASA says. According to the publication, 
"more than four years have passed but the SDS, the BSP and the 
president still do not dare publicly name the price of the 
transition to a market economy which Bulgarians have been paying 
through the constant drop in their incomes, living standards and 
social status". "They say nothing about the price because they 
do not dare take the responsibility and govern the country in an 
open and honest way," the author points out. 
  "75 percent of Bulgarians disapprove of Parliament, 65 
percent are against Berov", 24 CHASA reports publishing the 
results of a representative opinion poll conducted by the BBSS 
Gallup International in May. [passage omitted]
