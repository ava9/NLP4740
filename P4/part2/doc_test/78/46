<F P=106> [Interview with Ahmed Dogan, leader of the Movement for </F>
Rights and Freedoms, by Mehmed Hodjov; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Khodzhov] Mr. Dogan, by what formula can the 
government survive today? 
  [Dogan] This is the first time since the DPS [Movement for 
Rights and Freedoms] assumed the mandate to form a government 
that the government has faced such an extremely tricky situation. 
  Last week, the main thing that worried us was that the BSP 
[Bulgarian Socialist Party] was doing everything possible to get 
its own representative into the government. We rejected this on 
principle, because the situation on the basis of which the 
so-called government of experts was formed at the end of 1992 is 
quite different from the present political realities. 
  In our view, the fact that the BSP has 100 deputies in 
parliament does not constitute a position in the political 
sense. This party was in power for half a century; it is 
affrontery, to say the least, for it to make claims for power 
now, when we are making a transition and want to change the very 
thing that the BSP created. 
  Professor Berov, who has very great power and has to bear 
the 
responsibility for a definite program that parliament approved, 
should not try to be a balancing force in the National Assembly 
and exert pressure on parliament. In my opinion, this is where 
his mistake lies. 
  At present we are really considering a parliamentary 
agreement between the different political forces inside and 
outside parliament. 
  [Khodzhov] This agreement is in the context of the proposal 
made by the president in his address to the nation, is it not? 
  [Dogan] First, I support the proposal the president made to 
the nation, but I would naturally like to point out that I am 
not convinced that this parliamentary agreement is possible, 
given the extremely complex situation that exists in the country 
at present. Second, if, on the basis of this agreement, 
parliament approves a government that is authorized by the 
president to act as a caretaker cabinet, this will be a new 
precedent in our Constitution. [passage omitted] 
  [Khodzhov] Mr. Dogan, when you were in Kurdzhali you said 
that elections will most likely be held in October. What sort 
of representation does the DPS count on having in the next 
parliament? 
  [Dogan] The DPS will have a very decent representation in 
parliament. One does not comment on the predictions, but if you 
write down what I tell you, you will see that we may even get 
more seats. A party should have untapped reserves, and we are 
working on them. Naturally, we will have a completely different 
platform, updated to take account of the social problems arising 
from unemployment and the economic program. The great 
disadvantage of our cadres is that many lightweight people have 
taken key positions. We are starting right now to select cadres 
for the next elections, on the basis of certain criteria. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Khodzhov] Mr. Dogan, do you believe that the Turks are 
united in Bulgaria? I am thinking of [ex-Chief Mufti] Nedim 
Gendzhev's DPS [Democratic Party of Justice, with the same 
initials as the Rights and Freedoms Movement] and of Mehmed 
Hodja leaving your movement. 
  [Dogan] It would be stupid for the Turks to be united. I 
would not agree to represent an organization formed on an ethnic 
basis. We do not need armed soldiers, but we do need thinking 
people with similar ideas. If Nedim Gendzhev is such clever 
fellow, why is he forming a Democratic Party of Justice instead 
of calling it the Party of Free Democrats or some other name? 
Everyone hovers around the DPS, because it is very important 
as a symbol. However, whereas earlier it was the former 
repressions that united us, what must unite us now is our 
economic interests -- this is the great change in the DPS 
program. The people will sense this transformation from now on. 
One cannot create a party only on the basis of rights and 
freedoms. The man in the street is now banging the table and 
saying: I am out of work, I have nothing to eat. Previously, we 
did not appreciate this fact, but it is already knocking and 
even hammering on our door. It seems that from now on the 
market mechanism even postulates a fragmentation of society, but 
let us not discuss this issue now.
