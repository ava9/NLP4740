  [Text] Sofia, June 8 (BTA) -- The leader of Macedonia's 
Human Rights Party, Bulgarian citizen Ilija Ilievski, said today 
that during the upcoming census in Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] from June 21 to July 5 
Bulgarians there will be deprived of the right to freely express 
their national identity. At a press conference here, Ilievski 
said the census will take place in the conditions of continuing 
systematic violations of the human rights of citizens of 
Bulgarian nationality and its results will not be objective and 
reliable. 
  The leader of this opposition party outlawed by Macedonia's 
Supreme Court in January said the questionnaires for the census 
did not contain "Bulgarian nationality" as an option. He also 
said this year's census will violate the major document of the 
UN Economic and Social Council saying such censuses should take 
place in a year ending in 0 or 5. 
  Ilievski discussed his Geneva visit from June 1 to 3 and 
said 
he briefed on these matters the International Conference on 
Former Yugoslavia, the UN Commission on Human Rights and 
international nongovernmental human rights groups.
