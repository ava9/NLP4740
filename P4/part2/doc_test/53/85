  [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] General Staff is 
satisfied with the Cairo agreement signed between the PLO and 
Israel on 9 February. A military source yesterday said that 
"under the present circumstances, it is the best agreement." 
The source asserted that both sides had conceded on points they 
would not have compromised on in the past, and the General Staff 
feels this is the best possible agreement. 
  Senior IDF sources said that the test would be the 
implementation of the agreement. According to a military 
source, the IDF has reacted positively to the agreement, but 
many details have yet to be worked out and many difficulties are 
to be expected before the agreement can be implemented. 
  IDF sources stressed that the Cairo agreement is being 
perused in detail by top military officials and every detail is 
being examined from a professional standpoint. A senior IDF 
source said: "in general, it is a good agreement. Most of our 
interests have been protected, especially the security interest." 
  According to the senior source, several issues still remain 
unresolved even after the agreement, such as the matter of the 
Palestinian police and the way security measures will be handled 
at the border crossings. 
  IDF sources state, for example, that the procedures for 
crossing the Palestinian checkpoint remain unclear. According 
to the agreement, passengers crossing through the Palestinian 
checkpoint will walk through a magnetic gate. An Israeli and 
Palestinian guard will stand on each side of the gate, and in 
any suspicious case will be permitted to carry out a body search 
at the gate and to question the traveler. The IDF anticipates 
the possibility of problems and confrontations at the terminal, 
with each side demanding to check travelers. 
  The IDF is still studying the Cairo agreement and will 
establish staff teams over the next few days to analyze the 
agreements and implement them on the ground. Officers at the 
Central and Southern Commands are prepared to withdraw from the 
Gaza Strip and Jericho as soon as the political echelon issues 
the order. As reported by HA'ARETZ, the General Staff has 
formulated a plan that will enable the troops to withdraw from 
the Gaza Strip and Jericho within one month.
