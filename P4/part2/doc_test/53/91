<F P=106> ["In Broad Daylight" column by Rajih al-Khuri: "The </F>
Massacre"] 
  [Text] Israel has brought together the necessary elements 
and created the right possibilities for the "Palestinian 
massacre." 
  It is not possible to explain in any other way the order the 
Israeli Army received to prepare for speedy withdrawal from Gaza 
and Jericho. 
  Despite the progress the negotiations are making between the 
Palestinian and Israeli committees, even if on the "basis of 
crumbs" which constitutes a prominent element in the strategy of 
Israeli negotiation, the rush to evacuate Gaza and Jericho 
before the set date of 13 April is nothing less than a time-bomb 
the Israelis are planting under the feet of the PLO and Hamas. 
  Before discussing the reasons behind this upcoming massacre, 
we need to recall the many Israeli voices that during the past 
two years have not stopped demanding that the ball of fire be 
thrown in the lap of the Palestinians and the occasional 
official calls for evacuating the terrorist mire in reference to 
the Gaza Strip, where the stone revolution has not abated. 
  This was before reaching the autonomy agreement on 13 April 
1993, and before the agreement and the detailed talks it 
stipulates between the two sides reached the point of no return, 
as Shim'on Peres says. 
  And now, there is no escape from moving forward, even if the 
road is a field of knives, at least for Yasir 'Arafat who cannot 
go backwards even though he is shaking politically every time he 
makes progress. 
  He is a prisoner of this iron wager that is imposed by the 
talks. It has led not only to denuding him of all the slogans, 
papers, and maneuvers, but also of his own skin, not to mention 
his head. 
  What does he have in hand other than the "autonomy" 
agreement 
which can barely be seen with the naked eye, especially since 
the area of Gaza and Jericho that will come under the autonomy 
is no bigger than the Fatah-land 'Arafat reigned over in 
Lebanon, and especially since his authority in that area, which 
constitutes an amplified form of the Ansar detention camp, is no 
more than the authority of a taxi driver from Sabra during the 
days of "the Palestinian mandate" over Sabra camp. 
  It is autonomy on paper only. In practice, a reading of the 
agreement's articles regarding the crossings for example, is 
enough for a person entering Gaza and Jericho to realize that 
the Hebrew stamps have been imprinted not only on his passport, 
but on his forehead, and perhaps even his brain. 
  Therefore, what can 'Arafat offer the Hamas people, the 
rejectionists, the extremists, and those calling for jihad? 
What can he tell them? What can he promise them for the 
future, when he has nothing but this present? How will he keep 
the peace, with whom, and on what basis? 
  It is clear that it is too early for Rabin's government to 
call on 'Arafat to bear his responsibilities in combating 
terrorism as soon as possible. The day before yesterday, 
Israeli radio said that "Palestinian policemen" should be 
deployed in the Gaza Strip as a vanguard force at the end of 
this week. 
  We need to remember that pistols have taken the place of 
batons in the hands of the autonomy police as the result of a 
strong request from Shim'on Peres, since clubs are not enough to 
confront the Islamic resistance movement. 
  While the PLO is paying attention to training and preparing 
its policemen, Israel was setting the bloody stage with great 
care. Yasir 'Arafat himself a few days ago protested "that a 
terrible trade in arms is taking place under the supervision of 
Israeli forces in Gaza and Jericho. I believe that this has 
been seriously planned. They know that these weapons will not 
be used against them after they withdraw. So, who will they be 
used against? It is a very dangerous game if they are planning 
to create a new Afghanistan among the Palestinians." 
  The issue does not need 'Arafat's testimony, nor does it 
need 
the publicly declared fears that were expressed by Abu-'Ali 
Shahin, the official responsible for the Gaza Strip, who said 
that the pro-Likud Shin Bet is drowning the people with weapons 
and plotting to start a civil war among the Palestinians. 
  The issue does not need all these testimonies. It needs sane 
and careful thinking, not because the Palestinians do not have 
anything but this single chance to prove their competence, even 
within the framework of the autonomy and under the Israeli 
microscope, but because the Palestinian massacre will return 
Gaza and Jericho to Israeli rule upon a request from the 
Palestinians themselves. At this point, there are many lessons 
the residents of Gaza and Jericho need to learn. 
  They need to learn first for their own sakes, and maybe for 
the sake of others. This is because negotiations on the Syrian 
and Lebanese tracks could turn a full and empty circle waiting 
for what will happen to the Palestinians. 
  If things continue this way, the "full partner" in the peace 
process will naturally be the good successor of President Bill 
Clinton. 
  And may God help everyone.
