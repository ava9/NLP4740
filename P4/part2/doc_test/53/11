<F P=106> [XINHUA "Roundup" by Xie Dongfeng: "Israel, PLO Are Turning </F>
Words Into Deeds"] 
  [Text] Jerusalem, May 13 (XINHUA) -- It is the ninth day 
after the signing of the Gaza-Jericho accord. Israel and the 
Palestinians are turning words into deeds smoothly on the whole, 
though there have been some delays in the entry of Palestinian 
policemen into the autonomous areas. 
  In Jericho, Israeli and Palestinian officials will hold a 
brief ceremony this morning during which the authority of the 
city will be transferred to Palestinians, who will then take 
control of the civil administration building. 
  The last Israeli troops will leave the area this afternoon, 
ending almost 27 years of Israeli rule. 
  On Thursday [12 May], an advance team of 20 Palestinian 
officers crossed the Allenby Bridge and toured the Jericho area. 
  Later today, they will be joined by another 40 police 
officers who will take control of the sites to be taken over by 
Palestinians. 
  The two major military installations to be taken over are 
the 
Israeli Army base in the south and the Israeli police office in 
the city center. Only a handful of Israeli troops still remain 
there and everything is ready for a hand-over. 
  The Palestinian police will be also stationed at the site of 
the ancient synagogue, although under an agreement, Israelis are 
guaranteed access to the synagogue. 
  If the hand-over goes on smoothly, the area will be taken 
control by 426 Palestinian policemen from the Palestine 
Liberation Army from the Iraq-based Aqsa brigade who will arrive 
later this afternoon through the Allenby Bridge from Jordan. 
  Palestinian Police Chief Mudar Yusuf said Thursday in 
Jericho 
that the first priority will be to ensure law and order and the 
plans are for a self-rule area open to all. 
  So far, Jericho is still a closed military zone. An Israeli 
Army commander, Ilan Biran, said he issued such an order for 
fear of terrorist attacks both by extremist Palestinians and 
Jewish settlers. 
  In Gaza, though the first entry of Palestinian policemen was 
much delayed until the early hours of Wednesday, the Israeli 
troops completed the withdrawal from Southern Gaza Thursday 
night. 
  The soldiers evacuated all the outposts in Rafah although 
Palestinians have yet to take control of them. Earlier this 
morning, three positions in Khan Yunis were handed over to the 
Palestinian policemen. 
  It is reported that the Gaza City, Jabalya Refugee Camp and 
the rest of the northern strip of Gaza are expected to be handed 
over to Palestinians by next Wednesday. 
  In the coming days, contingents of PLA and Palestinian 
policemen will arrive in Gaza and Jericho from Arab states. 
  Meanwhile, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) 
published a list of 15 members of the 24-member governing 
council for the Gaza-Jericho areas. Israel had demanded a full 
list before handing over the reigns of authority. 
  Under the Gaza-Jericho accord signed in Cairo last week, the 
transfer of power from Israelis to Palestinians will be 
concluded within three weeks, that is, by May 25. 
  Israeli Deputy Chief of General Staff Amnon Shahaq said 
Wednesday that the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho 
could be fulfilled by the end of next week. 
  Now it seems that the Israeli troops are speeding up their 
pace of withdrawal to keep its promise that it had no intention 
to drag on in the future autonomous areas. 
  While the Palestinians are celebrating and preparing for 
their long-awaited autonomy, the Israeli Cabinet and Parliament 
have given green light to the Gaza-Jericho agreement to ensure 
support for the implementation of the accord. The opposition 
forces are strong, but nobody can turn the page upside down. 
  Accompanying the implementation of the accord is a peaceful 
scene the two areas have never seen in these years. 
  Both Israeli soldiers and Palestinians have shown their 
restraint, except for the clashes between Israeli soldiers and 
the anxious and impatient Palestinians awaiting the arrival of 
their own police Sunday. 
  On the other hand, the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) 
has stopped its terrorist actions recently, after it reached an 
agreement with the Fatah that it would suspend attacks on 
Palestinian collaborators for a month once the autonomy accord 
was signed. 
  However, there were still violent elements emerging these 
days. 
  Israeli security forces Thursday detained two Palestinians 
suspected of firing at an army post in Jabalya. Israeli border 
policemen arrested four men near Rafah Thursday, who were 
suspected of shooting and wounding an Israeli truck driver in 
Gush Katif in the afternoon. 
  On Tuesday, three Israelis were wounded by gunshots fired at 
egged bus No. 474 in Beitel of the West Bank, but it is still 
not clear who the attackers were.
