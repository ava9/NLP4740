  [Text] Amman--The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) 
has asked for total control over crossing points to Jericho and 
Gaza and joint supervision of the other crossings with Israel as 
a compromise to break the deadlock over the implementation of 
Palestinian autonomy, PLO officials said on Friday [31 December]. 
  The PLO demands were included in counter proposals that 
Palestinian negotiator Dr. Nabil Sha'th has conveyed to the 
Israeli government. Israeli officials have already declared 
that the government could consider its original proposals, put 
forward in Cairo last week, but will not accept to scrap them. 
[sentence as published] 
  The new Palestinian proposals according to PLO officials, 
are 
the following: 
<H5>  The Crossings </H5>
  A: The Palestinian flag should be hoisted on all entrances 
to crossings points and borders. 
  B: Two separate crossing points to Jericho and Gaza, at 
King Husayn Bridge and Rafah respectively, totally controlled by 
the Palestinians. 
  C: Palestinian participation over the other crossing 
points. 
<H5>  Jericho </H5>
  A: [as published] The area of Jericho extends from al-Nabi 
Musa to al-'Awja reaching the King Husayn Bridge. According to 
a senior PLO official in Tunis, the Palestinians are giving 
priority to access between Jericho and the bridge over the area 
under consideration. 
  "According to the accord it is a matter of time before the 
Israeli withdrawal from the Jericho district. But if they had 
control over the bridge, Jericho would have been like a 
detention camp" for Palestinian leadership. 
<H5>  The Gaza Strip </H5>
  A: [as published] The Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip 
will be confined to the boundaries of the settlements only. 
  The Israeli proposals allow for Palestinian presence at one 
of two windows in one checking point around 500 metres inside 
the borders leaving the actual control in Israeli hands. 
  Furthermore, Palestinian travellers will have to be cleared 
by the Israeli window at the checkpoints before proceeding to 
the Palestinian window. 
  The Israeli plan also stipulates retaining control of "a 
three-metre-long security strip" between Jericho and the bridge. 
The Palestinian counter proposal flatly rejects it. 
  The city of Jericho, according to the Israeli proposal, will 
be connected with al-'Awja through a special narrow strip 
leaving all of the land around Jericho to the King Husayn 
Bridge, under Israeli control, while Palestinians will only 
administer the religious sites in al-Nabi Musa. 
  By confining Israeli control to within the boundaries of the 
settlements in the Gaza Strip, the PLO hopes to thwart Israeli 
attempts to connect the settlements in one "security zone." But 
some PLO officials warn that the Palestinians should not concede 
to Israeli demands to control land within the settlements' 
boundaries. "The land within the settlements' boundaries are 
controlled by Israel any way against our will," said one PLO 
official. "The settlements are illegal and we should continue 
to deal with them through the negotiations as such."
