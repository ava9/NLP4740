  [Text] Cairo, Dec 30 (AFP)--The PLO has sent its own 
modified version of a working paper aimed at ending the deadlock 
on the launch of self-rule in the occupied territories, a 
Palestinian source said Thursday [30 December]. 
  The source, declining to be named, said the paper was the 
Palestinian version of a draft understanding, details of which 
were released earlier the same day in Israel. 
  If Israel accepts the latest document, the negotiations 
could 
result in agreement within two or three weeks, he said. 
  The PLO earlier denied Israeli claims that they had drawn up 
a draft agreement on launching Palestinian autonomy and said 
negotiators still had to hammer out an accord. 
  "We are trying in good faith to reach an agreement but, 
unfortunately, we have not reached it," said PLO negotiator 
Nabil Sha'th. 
  "We are going back to Taba in the old format of the 
negotiations," he told journalists, referring to the Egyptian 
Red Sea resort where the autonomy talks opened two months ago 
before moving to Cairo. 
  Egypt wound down its mediation efforts after a three-day 
meeting here of a liaison committee headed by Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres and executive committee member Mahmud 
'Abbas for the PLO. 
  Sha'th refused to comment on a draft understanding and said: 
"Our agreement was not to publish anything and anybody who is 
publishing anything is violating the agreement." 
  An Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank town of 
Jericho, under the September 13 autonomy accord, was to have 
started on December 13 but the deadline passed because of three 
main stumbling blocks. 
  The Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel are at 
loggerheads over the size of Jericho, the control of 
international crossing points and security for Jewish settlers 
in the Gaza Strip. 
  According to Israel's draft, the size of an autonomous 
Jericho will be doubled from the original offer and the border 
crossings into Jordan and Egypt will be jointly manned but 
Israel would have the final say. 
  But PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat said Thursday in Amman that his 
organisation had rejected the Israeli draft.
