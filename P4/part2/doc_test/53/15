  [Text] Jerusalem, April 2 (AFP) -- A first group of around 
1,500 Palestinian policemen will be deployed on Thursday [7 
April] in Gaza and Jericho where self-rule is to be launched, 
the PLO said here Saturday. 
  The office of Faysal al-Husayni, the PLO mainstream group 
Fatah's chief in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said three 
battalions of the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) would "start 
their mission immediately" on arrival. 
  One thousand former PLA fighters drafted in the police force 
will arrive in the Gaza Strip through the Rafah border post with 
Egypt. The other 500 will arrive in the West Bank town of 
Jericho over the Allenby bridge from Jordan. 
  The office added that a first group of Palestinian exiles 
would start to return on Tuesday, signaling "the start of the 
return of all the Palestinians expelled since 1967," when Israel 
seized the territories. 
  Israel and the PLO are close to agreeing on the deployment 
of 
up to 10,000 Palestinian policemen in Gaza and Jericho, chief 
PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th said Saturday. 
  "An accord on the number of policemen should be concluded 
during meetings of the PLO and Israeli security committee" which 
begin in Cairo on Sunday, Sha'th said in the Egyptian capital. 
  The talks would also focus on "preparations for the 
deployment" of the police and security arrangements for Jericho 
and Gaza. 
  "I don't think there is currently a problem on the number of 
policemen, which will be around 10,000," Sha'th said. 
  Under a security accord signed in Cairo on Thursday, Israel 
and the PLO agreed that 160 foreign observers would be deployed 
in the mosque massacre town of Hebron and a first contingent of 
Palestinian police would be sent this week.
