  [Text] Damascus, May 4 (AFP) -- Hardline Palestinian groups 
opposed to the Middle East peace process condemned the 
Palestinian self-rule accord signed in Cairo Wednesday [4 May] 
and vowed to continue the armed stuggle against Israel. 
  Damascus-based Palestinian groups described PLO chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat as a "traitor" who had "sold out" the Palestinian 
cause by signing the accord with Israel to launch self-rule in 
the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  Meanwhile, Palestinian refugees voiced anger and bitterness, 
saying the agreement ignored them, as it only provided for 
limited self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. 
  The PLO's main rival in the occupied territories, the 
Islamic 
Resistance Movement, Hamas, said in a statement here the 
Palestinian people were "not bound" by the agreement, and Hamas 
would "continue struggling until all the occupiers leave the 
occupied territories." 
  Palestinians in Lebanon's largest refugee camp, 'Ayn 
al-Hulwah, set tyres ablaze and distributed leaflets denouncing 
'Arafat as a traitor. 
  The Cairo signing marked "the downfall of the traitor 
('Arafat) and we all know the fate of traitors," said the 
leaflets, signed by 10 Syrian-backed Palestinian groups. 
  Most of Lebanon's refugees came from areas that became part 
of Israeli territory in 1948 and were not included in the deal. 
  In Syria's biggest refugee camp, al-Yarmuk near Damascus, 
Bassam Raja, 35, asked "where is Palestine?" in the deal. 
  "'Arafat is just a paper president," he said. "I am a 
stateless man whose dreams of return have been shattered." 
  In Jordan, home to most of the Palestinian refugees after 
the 
1967 war, the opinions among Palestinians were less hostile but 
still marked by reservations. 
  "The deal is doomed to failure as it does not satisfy the 
Palestinian aspiration for an independent state," said officials 
in the al-Husayn camp in Amman, where 12,000 refugees live. 
  Amman newspapers however expressed hopes that the agreement 
would mark a new era in Arab history. 
  Al-Dustur said the deal was "a turning point for the 
Palestinians, who have paid a heavy price to recover their 
legitimate national rights." 
  However, in Damascus al-Ba'th, the newspaper of Syria's 
ruling party, condemned the deal, saying it "turns Gaza and 
Jericho into a Zionist protectorate." 
  Syria, which boycotted the signing ceremony in Cairo, says 
the agreement is a "separate deal" that violates Arab solidarity. 
  In Libya, the official news agency JANA said the agreement 
was "an illusion," and again called on Arabs to "destroy the 
imperialist and racist entity," a reference to Israel.
