  [Text] Here are some of the major points in the agreement 
between the PLO and Israel which appear in the document received 
by our Arab affairs correspondent Ehud Ya'ari: 
  Both parties stress their determination to live in peaceful 
coexistence. Israel will withdraw from the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho within three weeks. 
  Both parties will take all the steps necessary to prevent 
terrorism, crime, and any acts of violence. Israel will be able 
to take interdictory measures in the areas where it is 
responsible for security with the intention of bringing any 
incidents to a rapid conclusion and turning them over to the 
Palestinian police to handle. The use of firearms will be 
prohibited, except in the case of immediate danger. Shots will 
be fired solely for the purpose of deterrence. 
  Israelis, including IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers, 
will be permitted to use the roads in the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho. Palestinians will be able to travel on the roads 
crossing through the Israeli settlements. 
  The Palestinian authority will be composed of 24 members and 
will be responsible for all legislative, executive, and judicial 
powers. The judicial powers of the Palestinian authority will 
not apply to Israelis. Israel retains judicial authority over 
the Israeli settlements. 
  The Palestinian authority will have no powers in the field 
of 
foreign relations, and it will be unable to establish embassies 
and consulates.
