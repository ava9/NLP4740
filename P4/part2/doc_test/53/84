  [Text] Bonn, May 2 (XINHUA) -- PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
said today that he believed the agreement on Palestinian 
self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho could be signed on 
Wednesday [4 May]. 
  'Arafat made the remarks at a press conference at the 
headquarters of Daimler-Benz A.G. in Stuttgart, Germany. 
  Commenting on the planned signing of the self-rule agreement 
in Cairo Wednesday, the PLO leader said, "where there is will 
there is a way." 
  But he cautioned that one person cannot dance a tango and 
the 
success also depends on the other party. 
  He said his talks with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
in Cairo tomorrow will be devoted to solving "some problems" and 
he hoped the meeting could "remove obstacles." 
  Asked when he would return to Jerusalem, Jericho or Gaza, 
'Arafat said this will depend on when Israel withdraws its 
troops from the occupied territories. 
  Israeli Army should have been pulled out of Gaza and the 
Jericho area before April 13 in accordance with an original plan. 
  'Arafat arrived in Stuttgart early today on a day-long visit 
at the invitation of the German automaker Daimler-Benz A.G. He 
met with company president Edzard Reuter on cooperation between 
Palestine and Germany. He also conferred with Erwin Teufel, 
minister-president of Baden- Wurttemberg.
