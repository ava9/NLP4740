  [Excerpt] Cairo, 7 May (MENA)--The vanguards of the 
Palestinian police and security forces left 'Ayn Jalut 
Palestinian forces' camp in Cairo for Rafah this morning as they 
prepare to enter the Gaza Strip within the next 48 hours. The 
forces will take charge of their tasks within the framework of 
the Palestinian National Authority. 
  These vanguards include some 1,000 people, mostly young men 
between 16 and 26 years old who live in Egypt and Sudan, 
although their families still reside in Gaza. 
  The Palestinian troops boarded buses bearing the picture of 
Palestinian Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. They waved their 
Palestinian flags and chanted patriotic Palestinian songs. 
  Major General Yusuf Nasr, commander of the Palestinian 
security forces in Gaza and Jericho, stated that the troops are 
expected to enter the Gaza Strip on Sunday or Monday. 
  Major General Yusuf Nasr affirmed that the Palestinian 
forces will complete their deployment in Gaza and the area of 
Jericho within 14 days, in accordance with the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement signed in Cairo. The agreement 
provides for completing the Israeli troop withdrawal and their 
replacement with Palestinian troops within 14 days of 4 May. 
  He added that Palestinian security and police forces 
arriving 
from Iraq and Jordan will head for Jericho tomorrow via the 
Allenby Bridge over the Jordan River to take over their tasks as 
soon as possible. He added that the security and police forces 
will be equipped with personal weapons, automatic rifles and 
pistols, in addition to light- and medium-machine guns. 
  Maj. Gen. Nasr pointed out that much of the assistance 
promised by various states has not arrived. Only 25 vehicles 
donated by the United States have arrived, he said, adding that 
an additional 175 vehicles will arrive on 15 May. He also said 
that a shipment of police uniforms has arrived from Sweden. 
  He noted that the troops going to Gaza today are 
self-equipped and are not reliant on foreign assistance. He 
added that a number of police stations in Gaza can absorb the 
first batch of Palestinian forces. We will need more centers 
and stations in coming days, he said. 
  Maj. Gen. Nasr pointed out that the Gaza Strip and Jericho 
area will need stability, reconstruction, and security in the 
future and there is no time for disputes among citizens of 
different political backgrounds. We believe in democracy and in 
every citizen's right to express himself, and we will cooperate 
with everyone, he said. 
  He added that the Palestinian security forces have developed 
a specific program to handle the problem of collecting arms from 
Gaza's citizens, but he refrained from revealing it. 
  Marwan Kanafani, adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat, has told MENA that the Palestinian troops will enter 
the Gaza Strip and Jericho as soon as they are allowed to. He 
explained that the Palestinians want to complete this task 
quietly and safely. 
  He noted that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin had 
stated 
that the Palestinian troops were not prepared to enter Gaza and 
Jericho. This is not true, he said, because the 9,000 troops 
will complete their entry in just 14 days. 
  He noted that the majority of these troops have never seen 
the Palestinian land, but that the homeland is in their hearts. 
  He affirmed that the Palestinian side is prepared to put 
forward new working papers and ideas when the Palestinian and 
Israeli negotiators get together to find a solution to a number 
of issues, such as the area of Jericho, the crossing points, 
Gaza's coastline, and others. He pointed out that the 
Palestinians base their work on ending the occupation. 
Therefore, he said, ideas will be put forward to achieve this 
goal. 
  Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Hayy 'Abd-al-Wahid, commander of 
the Palestinian 'Ayn Jalut forces in Egypt, gave a speech to the 
Palestinian police and security forces in which he said that 
this is the moment Palestinians have been awaiting for over 27 
years. You have to carry out the tasks you have been entrusted 
with in order to build our state and safeguard the homeland's 
security, he said, noting that the Palestinians have made great 
sacrifices for this moment. 
  He thanked the Egyptian Armed Forces for training these 
troops and the Egyptian people and President Mubarak for their 
support for the Palestinian people and cause. [passage omitted]
