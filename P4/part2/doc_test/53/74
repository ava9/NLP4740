  [Text] Moscow, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat held a series of talks with Russian 
leaders here on Tuesday [19 April], focusing on the Middle East 
situation, the Palestinian-Israeli settlement and bilateral 
relations. 
  His talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev, State Duma (the lower house of the 
parliament) speaker Ivan Rybkin and Interior Minister Viktor 
Yerin resulted in signing of an agreement on furthering 
bilateral political, economic and cultural cooperation. 
'Arafat, also chairman of the executive committee of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), arrived in Moscow on 
Monday evening for a two-day working visit to Russia. 
  During the meeting with the PLO leader, Yeltsin stressed 
that 
"comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East remains a 
Russian strategic priority in the region vitally important for 
Russia," the ITAR-TASS News Agency said. 
  The Russian president told 'Arafat that he is satisfied with 
the on-going Israeli-Palestinian negotiations to overcome 
confrontation and build a solid peace infrastructure despite all 
difficulties. 
  He reaffirmed Moscow's firm intention as a co-sponsor of the 
Mideast peace process to render comprehensive assistance to 
further progress at Arab-Israeli negotiations. 
  'Arafat praised Russia's contribution to the Mideast peace 
process and achievement of positive results in the Arab-Israeli 
dialogue. 
  Russia's diplomatic efforts has played a considerable role 
in 
settling difficulties aroused from the Hebron tragedy in 
February and in implementing measures to consolidate Palestinian 
security in occupied lands contained in the UN Security 
Council's Resolution 904, 'Arafat said. 
  He also thanked Russia for its readiness to help 
Palestinians 
in the establishing of self-rule administration in the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho area, the ITAR-TASS said. 
  At a news conference following the talks, Russian Foreign 
Minister Kozyrev said the Moscow talks is the continuation of 
the Russian-Palestinian dialogue which has been for several 
years and Moscow is "determined to eliminate all obstacles on 
the way towards comprehensive settlement" in the Middle East. 
  He also told reporters that he had assured the PLO leader of 
Russia's support to the PLO course against extremists and said 
the Palestinian and Russian leaders keep a constant contact via 
Yeltsin's special envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk and regular exchange 
of notes. 
  'Arafat described his Moscow trip as "the most important 
one." he and Kozyrev discussed ways to overcome obstacles in 
fulfillment of the Palestinian-Israeli peace accord on Gaza 
Strip and Jericho. 
  The PLO leader reminded that Israeli troops' withdrawal from 
Gaza Strip and Jericho expired on April 13 but nothing has been 
changed. He warned that the only alternative to peace is anarchy 
and "Balkanization" of the region. 
  'Arafat is scheduled to leave Moscow on Wednesday after 
meeting with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
