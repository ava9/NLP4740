  [Excerpts] Cairo, 3 Apr (MENA)--The Security Committee, a 
part of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on ways of 
implementing the Gaza-Jericho Palestinian autonomy agreement, 
began meeting in Cairo today. Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser, is leading the 
Palestinian side of this committee, while 'Uzi Dayan, head of 
the Israeli General Staff's Planning Branch, heads the Israeli 
side. 
  The committee is discussing a timetable for the Israeli 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho and the deployment of 
Palestinian forces there, including the number of Palestinian 
police to be stationed in the two areas, their tasks, and the 
equipment they will use. 
  Official Palestinian sources told MENA that there are 
indications that Israel will accept the Palestinian demand for 
10,000 Palestinian policemen. Formerly it insisted on limiting 
the number to only 6,000 policemen. They explained that this 
change in the Israeli position comes in the wake of the Hebron 
massacre of hundreds [as received] of Palestinian worshipers. 
  Representatives of the international observers from Norway 
and Denmark who will be deployed in Hebron are expected to join 
the meeting of the Security Committee. 
  It should be recalled that the observers team will consist 
of 
160 members from Norway, Denmark, and Italy. 
  The Palestinian delegation has held meetings in Cairo for 
the 
past two days to discuss the dispatch of Palestinian police 
officers to Gaza and Jericho. It has been decided that the 
first 300 police will enter these areas on Tuesday [5 April]. 
They will be followed by 1,500 more policemen on Thursday. 
Others will follow later. They will prepare for taking over 
control of the self-rule areas of Gaza and Jericho in accordance 
with the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. 
  Israeli sources in Cairo said that General Amnon Shahaq will 
arrive Monday morning to participate in the negotiations 
regarding the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First 
agreement. [passage omitted] 
  Other negotiations committees on the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho self-rule agreement are scheduled to begin their 
meetings tomorrow. [passage omitted]
