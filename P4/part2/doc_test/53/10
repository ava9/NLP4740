  [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, June 25 (AFP) -- Israel and 
the PLO still have 26 disputed points to hammer out in May's 
Cairo self-rule accord, PLO chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said 
on Saturday [25 June]. 
  "There are about 26 questions that have been postponed at 
the 
Cairo agreement," Sha'th told reporters here, blaming Israel for 
delays in negotiations. 
  The disputed points in the Israeli-PLO accord mainly centre 
on the borders of the self-rule enclaves of Jericho and the Gaza 
Strip, "which Yasir 'Arafat amended on the map on the day of the 
signing," Sha'th said. 
  He said Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation 
would resume talks on the extension of self-rule in the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank on Tuesday, "probably in the occupied 
territories." 
  He accused Israel of delaying the talks since May 18. "Now 
we are late in starting to talk about the second phase by two 
months," he said. 
  "We are ready to start talks, at the head of which is the 
question of a timetable for the release of prisoners." 
  He added: "The date of the Israeli withdrawal from all West 
Bank towns and villages is not tied to the Gaza-Jericho 
(self-rule) experiment but to the agreement, to nine months from 
the signing of the agreement. 
  "We cannot wait five years to see if Gaza-Jericho is 
successful or not." 
  Certain issues such as the exact size of the self-rule 
enclave of Jericho were put to one side before the May 4 
autonomy accord so the signing ceremony could go ahead in Cairo, 
launching autonomy in the West Bank town and the Gaza Strip.
