Israel began a long-delayed transfer of authority to the PLO in the Gaza
Strip last night, handing over the first military base to Palestinian police
officers, Reuter reports.
The handover in the town of Deir al-Balah came hours after a first group of
157 policemen had moved into Gaza from Egypt. Gaza's streets were filled
with thousands of excited Palestinians witnessing the transition into the
early hours of this morning.
Under the terms of the peace accord, Israel will transfer all civilian and
policing authority to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of
Jericho within weeks.
A senior adviser to Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, said 1,800 policemen would be deployed in Gaza and 400 in
Jericho by Friday.
The policemen who arrived yesterday were unarmed and dressed in olive-drab
uniforms. They brought in 24 jeeps. They were stuck for hours at the Rafah
border terminal in southern Gaza, apparently delayed by bureaucratic snags.
