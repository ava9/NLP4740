  [Excerpts] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has moved two 
bases from densely populated Arab areas in the Gaza Strip to 
other locations. This is part of the IDF's redeployment in 
anticipation of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement with the 
Palestinians. IDF sources stressed that the evacuation of 
troops from refugee camps will be carried out concurrently with 
progress in the talks with the PLO. Our Army affairs 
correspondent Yariv Ben-Yehuda has more details: 
  Two bases have been evacuated within three days -- one in 
Gaza's Rimal neighborhood two days ago, and another, a Border 
Police base in Rafah, which was moved yesterday to the southern 
sector headquarters from which the Border Police will continue 
their operations in the Rafah area in the same scope of 
deployment and activity. Army sources said that in the 
framework of the numerous logistic changes carried out in the 
Gaza Strip recently, buildings and troops have been relocated 
and, in some cases, troops have been concentrated in one central 
location from which they are to continue their operations before 
and after the implementation of autonomy. The sources stressed 
that the volume of the IDF's operations has not changed; on the 
contrary, it has been increased recently, resulting in the 
successful apprehension of many fugitives and the foiling of 
terrorist attacks. The sources further emphasized that the pace 
of troop evacuation from refugee camps will be tied to the 
progress of the talks with the PLO. [passage omitted] 
  The structures from the two evacuated bases will be moved to 
outposts currently under construction near Jewish settlements in 
the Strip. It should be noted that the construction of these 
outposts is at an advanced stage. The IDF preparations for 
redeployment include the imminent transfer of several other 
bases. Defense establishment elements stressed this morning 
that the Gaza and Jericho redeployment can be completed within a 
few weeks after the agreement is signed.
