FT  29 NOV 93 / Fabian warning of Labour rift
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp warning that the Labour party risks relapsing into the complacency
which lost it the past four general elections is issued today by the Fabian
Society.
Ms Glenys Thornton, the acting general secretary of the centrist Labour
pressure group, says the party's unwillingness to confront change threatens
to paralyse attempts to create a strategy appropriate to the 1990s rather
than the 1960s or 1970s.
In a hard-hitting article in the latest issue of Fabian Review, she adds
that the backlash by traditionalists against the party's modernisers has
provoked a dangerous outbreak of faction fighting among Labour MPs.
