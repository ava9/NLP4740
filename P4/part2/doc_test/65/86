FT  12 APR 94 / Shadow chancellor proposes review of NI system
</HEADLINE>

Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday proposed a revamp of the
National Insurance system to finance lifetime educational assistance and
'personal development plans' for individuals, Kevin Brown writes.
In a Fabian Society pamphlet Mr Brown says there is a strong case for
revamping employment benefits 'for the new world of permanent lifelong and
recurrent' education and training.
He adds: 'National Insurance benefits need not just be benefits against
periods of unemployment but also offer help for training and retraining and
for the provision of personal development plans, with people offered the
best careers advice, not just on leaving school, but throughout their
working lives.'
Mr Brown gave no details of how the revamped National Insurance scheme would
work, partly because the issue is being discussed by Labour's policy
commissions. However, the pamphlet suggests that Labour is looking
increasingly seriously at the idea of earmarking tax revenues for specific
purposes as a means of rebuilding trust in the taxation system.
Mr Brown reaffirms Labour's commitment to a minimum wage and calls for a
'skills revolution'. 'Investment by the community as a whole in the
potential of people - in their employment opportunities and their education
and skills - is the major determinant of both economic growth and the relief
of poverty.'
