Alex Van Pelt threw for 181 yards and three touchdowns, and eighth-ranked 
Pittsburgh took advantage of six Temple turnovers for a 27-3 victory Saturday 
at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Van Pelt threw touchdown passes to Henry Tuten and Reggie Williams in a shaky 
first half. Pitt (4-0-1) had three interceptions, two by Robert Bradley, and 
three fumble recoveries to spoil Temple's homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
Van Pelt also threw a fourth-down, one-yard touchdown pass to Tom Huebner with 
5:27 to play after Huebner recovered a fumbled punt on the Temple 30-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Temple (0-6) took a 3-0 lead when Bob Wright kicked a 24-yard field goal with 
8:05 left in the first quarter. But mistakes ended key opportunities for the 
Owls, who have not scored a touchdown in their last five games. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley intercepted a pass by Victor Lay and returned it to the Temple 44 to 
set up Pittsburgh's first score. Tuten made a diving catch of Van Pelt's pass 
in the end zone for a 7-3 lead with 2:22 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Van Pelt threw a 38-yard pass to Williams to give the Panthers a 14-3 lead with 
10:27 to play in the half. 
</P>
<P>
A 35-yard pass from Van Pelt to Tuten set up a 30-yard field goal by Frazier 
and a 17-3 halftime lead as time ran out. Frazier kicked a 32-yarder in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force 35, Navy 7 -- Quarterback Dee Dowis threw two touchdown passes to 
Steve Senn as the Falcons won their seventh in a row against the Midshipmen at 
Annapolis, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Navy (1-4) trailed by only seven late in the first half and had contained the 
Air Force running game, ranked No. 1 with a 478 yards per game average. The 
Falcons improved to 6-0 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State 17, Rutgers 0 -- The Nittany Lions shut down the Scarlet Knights' 
offense at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The win was the fourth in a row for Penn State (4-1). It's the Lions' longest 
winning streak since 1987 and the shutout also was the first since a 41-0 
victory over Cincinnati the same year. Rutgers dropped to 2-1-2.
