<P>
HomeFed Corp. President Robert F. Adelizzi has been named chief executive of 
the savings-and-loan holding company, taking over day-to-day management from 
Kim Fletcher, who will remain board chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Adelizzi joined HomeFed, the parent of HomeFed Bank, in 1962, and has been its 
president since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
He is also a board director. Adelizzi, 54, is a graduate of Dartmouth College 
and the University of San Diego School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Fletcher said his primary reason for vacating the chief 
executive's job at the $18-billion thrift is to give Adelizzi the opportunity 
to "move up and assume more responsibility and be rewarded in title at the same 
time." 
</P>
<P>
"Bob has done an outstanding job as president and chief operating officer," 
Fletcher said. "We have worked together as a team for over 20 years, and it's 
only right that he be given the recognition." 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, 62, said HomeFed has no mandatory retirement age and age was not a 
factor in his decision to step down. He will remain on certain of HomeFed's 
board committees and keep an office at the S&amp;L. Fletcher, a yachtsman, also 
said he expects to devote more time to his work on the America's Cup organizing 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher has been HomeFed chairman since 1979 and chief executive since 1969 
and owns about 1.7% of outstanding HomeFed shares. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed has been strongly identified with the Fletcher family ever since 
Charles K. Fletcher, Kim's father, founded Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan in 
1934. The elder Fletcher retired as chairman in 1963 and died in 1986. The 
S&amp;L changed to its name last year. 
</P>
<P>
But Kim Fletcher said his family's involvement in HomeFed management will end 
with him, as none of his children plans to make a career at the S&amp;L.
