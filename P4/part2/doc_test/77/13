inflate respect for its new currency, but many fear its glitter will not
last

The conservative government of Uzbekistan yesterday introduced a new
currency, the som, without international backing, to the alarm of the few
western traders still toughing it out in Tashkent.
Nor are they the only ones worried by the move, decreed by Mr Islam Karimov,
the Uzbekistan president. Since the announcement the black market rate of
the interim currency, the coupon, has fallen by 33 per cent. Western traders
suggest that even the government is uncertain about the new currency launch.
They point to an unusual government tender planned next month in Tashkent,
in which residential properties will be sold exclusively for dollars.
'It shows that someone in government doesn't believe the som is going to
remain convertible for very long,' a senior western business consultant in
Tashkent said.
In a public relations drive that reflects the lack of any substantial
under-pinning of the new currency, the state media have tried to inflate
respect for the som by referring to it as 'His Majesty the som'.
But the International Monetary Fund has halted talks on currency support,
since Mr Karimov refused to set the stage for the som by first altering
economic policies that have fuelled a 1,500 per cent annual inflation rate.
Uzbekistan left the rouble zone eight months ago. In April, the government
initiated talks with the IMF, which had already awarded support programmes
to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.
But IMF officials decided Mr Karimov was not prepared to shift his economic
policies sufficiently to sustain long-term currency stability.
'The government thinks it can avoid strict fiscal and monetary policy,' said
a western economist in Tashkent, 'but this is impossible.'
Lacking IMF support, the government is backing the som with Dollars 700m
(Pounds 466m) in cash and an undisclosed quantity of gold.
The som will circulate at an initial rate of six to the dollar; the
government will exchange the new currency without restriction at a rate of
one som to 1,000 coupons. During the one-month phase-in, the coupon will be
honoured alongside the som.
At current exchange rates, the som will be worth almost seven times the
value of the coupon, a level western analysts say is almost sure to decline
sharply and quickly.
They believe Mr Karimov will continue to try to dictate the value of
Uzbekistan's currency, though with just Dollars 700m in reserves he will not
manage to intervene in support of the new som for long.
Mr Karimov has attempted, at least at first, to restrain expected
devaluation by restricting the circulation of the new currency in its
initial month of circulation.
Uzbekistanis will be required to deposit their coupons in state banks but
will not be permitted for a month to exchange them for the new currency,
thus restricting circulation to the current month's state salaries.
The currency's introduction mirrors Mr Karimov's administration of
Uzbekistan's economy as a whole since independence came with the Soviet
collapse 30 months ago.
On paper, the republic has tantalised western investors, if a bit less than
its richer central Asian neighbours, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.
During the Soviet period, Uzbekistan served mainly as a cotton bin, growing
most of the Soviet crop and becoming the world's fourth largest producer.
Uzbekistan also produced 60 tonnes of gold a year, and in 1993 extracted
45bn cubic metres of natural gas. About 4m tonnes of oil were produced last
year, and recent discoveries make this figure likely to rise.
Trouble has come because Mr Karimov has expended enormous efforts trying to
conserve the Soviet system that put him in power during the Gorbachev era.
For example, state enterprises still thrive by borrowing money from the
government at a significant negative interest rate, since Mr Karimov is keen
to avoid causing unemployment.
He has rejected western advice that, with a spiralling 3.5 per cent birth
rate and half the population of 21m below the age of 19, Uzbekistan should
move quickly with a reform package of subsidy reduction and industrial
restructuring.
One of Mr Karimov's tendencies has been wholeheartedly to support market
reform and western investment (in January he unveiled a well received
reformist programme) as long as it does not disturb anything.
Thus, his policies have produced only a slight crack in the door through
which just a few investors have managed to pass. Notable among these are
Daewoo, Mercedes-Benz and Newmont Mining. This week, as well, BAT Industries
is to sign a Dollars 190m deal to develop Uzbekistan's domestic and export
market for cigarettes.
Analysts say that Mr Karimov's tight economic grip has also been the main
problem with Uzbekistan's disastrous monetary policy but that he is unlikely
to lighten up soon.
One western business consultant in Taskhent said: 'We hear all the time
here: 'Before you move into your new house you don't destroy your old one.'
Karimov is just going to be very cautious.'
