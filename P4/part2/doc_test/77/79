WORLD WAR II: STRICTLY BY THE NUMBERS;

By Duncan Spencer, Spencer is a Washington writer currently at work on a 
biography of World War II paratroop leader Gen. James M. Gavin.

<TEXT>
<P>
John Ellis figuratively stuck his nose into the sweaty boots of soldiers in his 
best known World War II book, "The Sharp End of War," to describe the life of 
ordinary soldiers from 1939 to 1945. Now the British historian has written the 
large end, the sums, as it were, of the combatants in mankind's worst war. 
</P>
<P>
"Brute Force" applies new quantitative scholarship to World War II, but it is 
written so skillfully that the reader greets voluminous footnotes with 
pleasure, not the usual guilty dread. This thick book is a mental feast for 
those who have long sought a key to understanding how and why the war unfolded 
as it did. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis is not impressed by heroics, or reputations, or specific battles, or most 
of the men and deeds that have made World War II a subject of hundreds of 
books. In fact, his usual tack is to debunk the reputations (Montgomery, 
Patton, Harris, MacArthur all suffer) and deflate the heroes. He is impressed 
by numbers -- of divisions, of ships, of trucks, of guns, of tons of iron ore 
and coal. 
</P>
<P>
It is by poring over these bills of lading, these yellowing papers showing the 
order of battle, the simplest, barest building blocks of history, that he 
reaches his remarkable conclusions. The war, he says, was not won by courage or 
tactics or strategy, but by the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
By the numbers, Ellis concludes that it was not the American soldiers or their 
allies who beat the Germans, but the Russians. By the numbers, he concludes 
that the United States, in spite of its important military contribution to the 
war in Europe and the Pacific, was far more important as a producer of machines 
and supplies; and even so, the American wealth of material allowed this country 
to waste time, lives and billions in ineptitude and duplication. Brute force, 
the title, alludes not only to the method the United States fell into for 
waging war but also to the dismissive English put-down: "brute force and 
ignorance." 
</P>
<P>
He is merciless in his treatment of American management of the Pacific war, 
pointing out that a naval blockade would have accomplished the same thing as 
the land and sea battles and the atom bomb. 
</P>
<P>
He turns familiar events on their ear with his statistics. Under his numerical 
analysis, for instance, the Russian Army did not defeat the German legions. 
Instead, he proves that the Germans destroyed themselves by pouring men and 
metal at an endless supply of Russian targets until the Germans simply had 
nothing left. Ellis proves that the Russians were able to provide more targets 
than the Germans had bullets -- and that decided the contest. 
</P>
<P>
To use another stunning example, Ellis proves by his method that the real 
achievement of the carpet bombing of Germany was not the destruction of the 
famous "bottlenecks" of the Nazi war machine, nor the destruction of German 
urban life. (Other historians, including Albert Speer, already have made this 
point.) The real achievement was to lure out German pilots with enough targets 
to the point that the Luftwaffe simply wasted itself trying to shoot them down. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis is not content with this conclusion. When he analyzes the Allies' 
"strategic bombing" program, his cool appraisal is that it was not what it 
seemed, and it also was completely wrong-headed. The most vulnerable targets in 
Germany, he argues, were not plants that produced oil for the well known ball 
bearings, but something far simpler, far more exposed, far more fragile, far 
easier to hit: electricity production and distribution, the common element to 
all industrial production. Yet the leaders of the bombing effort did not 
understand this in 1942 or later. 
</P>
<P>
This book will be controversial because it is a thorough put-down of the United 
States. We have been accustomed to our heroes -- Patton, Eisenhower, Marshall, 
MacArthur, Admiral King and others. We are prouder of World War II than of any 
other war, I venture, because we did not hesitate to help Britain when she 
fought on alone in Europe, and we did not hesitate to fight a war on two fronts 
when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. We were great and we were good. 
</P>
<P>
But we were not great and good in just the way we thought. "It could well be 
argued, indeed," writes Ellis in a typical measured, symphonic paragraph, "that 
the most significant figures in the tables just cited are the 2,400,000 
military trucks produced in the United States as against only 346,000 in 
Germany. Goering's taunt about (American) 'cars and refrigerators' becomes yet 
more fatuous, completely underestimating as it does not only the phenomenal 
productive potential of the American econonomy but also the central role of the 
internal-combustion engine in modern warfare. Many battlefields have been cited 
as being particularly significant in Germany's defeat in the Second World War. 
Not the least of them should be Detroit." 
</P>
<P>
The humble trucks, you see, have a story to tell. In North Africa, in Russia, 
in the long German retreat from Normandy to Berlin from June 1944 to April 
1945, it was the trucks, or the lack of them -- not "the intrepid exploits of 
few gung-ho tank commanders" -- that won and lost the war. It was the trucks 
that were tasked with carrying the gasoline, the ammunition, the food -- 
without which the thin-stretched Germans, in particular, could not operate. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 432,659 American trucks went to Russia under Lend-Lease 
arrangements, and it is to Russia that Ellis returns again and again to drive 
home his most important point -- his convincing argument that Russian blood and 
American steel were the heaviest weights in the balance of victory. Of American 
steel, most people in this country know a good deal, and the fact that the 
entire industrial base was turned to production of munitions is still well 
remembered here. But the appalling sacrifice -- not heroic exactly; call it 
benumbed or heedless -- of Russia's soldiers is less known. 
</P>
<P>
On the eastern front, according to Ellis' well documented calculations, between 
1941 and the end of the war the Germans lost 2,300,000 men. The Russian total 
is generally accepted to be about 13,500,000. The Russians attacked throughout 
without counting the cost. On occasion, they simply marched across minefields 
to close with their foe because their commanders' estimated losses would be 
about equivalent to those they would suffer if the Germans were using artillery 
instead of mines. Comments Ellis: "There can be no doubt that it was Russian 
arms and Russian blood, the pitiless, ceaseless hemorrhage of a whole people . 
. . Perhaps even if Russia had been knocked out of the war, the Americans would 
still eventually have invaded Europe. But in that case they would have come up 
against 150 more divisions they had to fight and one million extra German 
soldiers they had to kill." 
</P>
<P>
All books about World War II circle about the extraordinary enemy, Germany. 
Ellis' fascinating work is no exception, yet he is as confounded as the rest. 
His research shows only that after 1941 there was no possible way for them to 
win -- and it shows too that the Germans knew this all along. Yet they kept on, 
with their extraordinary skill in battle, their intelligent use of slender 
resources, their fierceness and discipline, their wicked strength. 
</P>
<P>
This is the dark question that always lures us to their World War II story.
