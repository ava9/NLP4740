IF I could have one luxury it would be infinite quantities of the finest,
most delicate, most perfectly shaped wine glasses in the world, plus the
all-important space in which to store them.
The Tyrolean glassblowers who would therefore have to get blowing are those
responsible for the Riedel Sommelier range, an ever-expanding set of shapes
individually designed by Austrian Georg Riedel as 'tasting tools' to
maximise the pleasure given by specific styles of wine.
Fortunately, unlike the Burgundian Impitoyables range which really is
merciless in its assault on the sensitive eye as well as in exposing any
wine fault, Riedel's glasses satisfy aesthetic criteria too - although he
claims this is a secondary consideration. His burgundy glass is on permanent
show at New York's Museum of Modern Art.
As luxuries go, Riedel's pingingly delicate and efficacious handblown
Sommelier glasses are not that expensive. Peter Jones, the London SW3
householder's mecca, sells the glasses specially designed to enhance young
red bordeaux at Pounds 24.50 each, as opposed to their (excellent value)
equivalents with a machine-made stem from the Vinum range at Pounds 11.50.
There is fierce competition in glassware, or stemware as it is known in
America, at the top end of the market. What makes Georg Riedel's product so
attractive is his conviction that wine glasses - even the finest, most
delicate and most expensive - are best washed not by hand but in a
dishwasher.
According to the books, and the consensus of traditional wine lore,
dishwasher and even detergent are dirty words. The only way to treat a used
wine glass properly, they say, is to wash it throughly, rinse it in very hot
water and then to polish it dry with a perfectly clean, detergent-free linen
teatowel. (Wine traditionalists have probably saved the Irish linen business
from extinction.)
I have therefore spent years feeling guilty about my lazy habit of stuffing
as many wine glasses as possible into a machine rather than dedicating long
mornings-after to an orgy of rinsing and polishing.
It came as the most blessed relief to me then, to hear Georg Riedel's
revelation, made among the power lunchers at New York's Four Seasons
restaurant after a trial of his Pinot Noir glass conducted by such
international wine stars as Robert Drouhin, Len Evans, Angelo Gaja, the head
of Louis Jadot, Tim Mondavi and Christian Moueix. (This man knows the wine
world.)
He gave as evidence of his devotion to mechanical lavage, the fact that he
had just lent 3,000 glasses to a wine weekend in an alpine hotel and had
them shipped back, still reeking of first-growth claret, to the firm's glass
washing machines. He did admit that the domestic dishwasher at Schloss
Riedel is often too small for his needs but says that so long as we fill
surplus dirty glasses with water overnight, they can safely be put through
the dishwasher in the morning. Conversely, it is the humidity that harms the
glass after washing, so glasses should ideally be unloaded as soon as
possible after each cycle.
Riedel's leaflets even spell out which dishwasher models will accommodate
racks specially designed for glasses such as his - and such is his devotion
to detail that he specifies the order numbers of the parts. Miele G530-567
and G579-590 are wineglass friendly according to Riedel's copious
literature, as are all Bosch and Siemens dishwashers.
My Hotpoint (a phrase I somehow never thought I would find myself using)
leaves even my finest glasses whole, sparkling and free of the inimical
smell of detergent - although admittedly it is supplied via a water
softener. The secret is to use detergent sparingly - and to make sure that
the rest of the stuff in the dishwasher is not covered with coffee grains or
leftover food. By comparison, our champagne glasses, too tall for the
machine, always look horribly besmirched after their handwash.
Another company that takes the (all too rare) wine lover's view of top
quality glassware is John Jenkins, of Rogate, near Petersfield, in
Hampshire. John Jenkins' Bohemian Classic range, at about the same price as
Riedel's Vinum, is useful for its good-value handmade all-rounders. The
Jenkins team refuse to go on the record endorsing dishwashers, but they do
use them.
They of all people will know that thinner, in a glass context, does not mean
more fragile; Riedel and Baccarat glasses will often bounce if dropped,
which is by no means the case with Esso giveaways.
Riedel's Sommelier and Vinum glasses, and John Jenkins' Bohemian Classic
glasses, are stocked by Peter Jones of London SW3, Harrods and a host of
good wine merchants.
