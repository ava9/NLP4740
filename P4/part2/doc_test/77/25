  [Text] Kroekkrai Chiraphaet, director general of the 
Business Economic Department, has commented on the first APEC 
[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] Senior Officials Meeting 
[SOM] -- as well as the Committee on Trade and Investment 
meeting -- held in Jakarta between 31 January and 4 February. 
  According to him, officials placed emphasis on small and 
medium enterprises, which are under the APEC umbrella. Relevant 
working groups and committee were told to emphasize these 
because APEC believes they will contribute to the economic 
development of its members, especially regarding regional 
distribution of income. Consideration, however, must be given 
to enterprises that really respond to the needs of each country. 
  With the conclusion of the GATT talks, the APEC group 
pursued 
its call for liberalization within the grouping. Thailand must 
plan ahead for five years from now and must adapt, because 
Thailand will have to remain with APEC whether it likes it or 
not. 
  Withun Tulayanon, the department's expert on regional trade 
who also attended the Jakarta SOM, said the meeting tasked 
Indonesia with preparing for an informal APEC trade ministers 
meeting during the next GATT meeting, which will be held in 
Morocco. This meeting will allow ministers to exchange views 
prior to the next APEC meeting, which is scheduled for Seattle 
[as published]. 
  He said that during the SOM, U.S. officials circulated 
copies 
of a paper on work that APEC should pursue that was adopted at 
APEC's Blake Island summit late last year. President Bill 
Clinton signed the paper. It was handed to Indonesian President 
Suharto, who will host this year's APEC meeting. The paper said 
it was agreed at Blake Island that an APEC investment code 
[preceding two words in English] should be drafted in 1994. The 
senior officials were surprised when they read the paper. 
Member countries agreed in principle at the summit to draw up 
an investment code, because this will facilitate the flow of 
capital within the grouping. There was no indication, however, 
that the move should be carried out this year. 
  Withun said that such a proposal had already been made to 
APEC in 1993 by the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) 
[preceding four words and acronym in English]. Under this 
proposal, investing countries would be given national treatment 
[preceding two words in English], which is even better than most 
favored nation status (MFN). There was also a prohibition 
against quotas on the use of local raw materials. The proposal 
was not supported by most members, and was finally rejected. 
  Many countries expressed surprise after reading the paper 
presented to the SOM. Many disagreed with its contents. Thai 
Board of Investment officials present also disagreed. The 
meeting decided that the issue should first be discussed by 
investment specialists from member countries scheduled to meet 
in the United States at some point. Thailand will send Board of 
Investment officials to attend. 
  According to a Commerce Ministry source, the United States 
pressed for a discussion of the investment code during the SOM. 
An early resolution of this matter would benefit the United 
States, particularly if it concerns the liberalization of 
foreign investment in the service sector, such as airlines, 
tourism, and banking. 
  Singapore and Hong Kong also support the move to speed up 
discussion of the investment code. As duty free ports, they 
both stand to benefit. Japan partially supports the move, but 
has reservations concerning telecommunications. Australia 
supports it. Thailand, Indonesia, China, and some other 
countries disagree with it. This includes Korea, which has 
never allowed foreign investment in its oil industry. 
  Anyway, it is possible that there was no mention in the APEC 
statement about concluding the investment code this year. Those 
who attended the SOM will have to report to Deputy Prime 
Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak and check with him as to 
whether there was any agreement at the APEC summit about a 
deadline for drawing up the investment code. The deputy prime 
minister attended the summit. 
  Withun also described the meeting of the Committee on Trade 
and Investment, which is a permanent mechanism of APEC, 
established under the International Charter on Trade and 
Investment adopted at the 5th APEC ministerial meeting in 
November 1993. The meeting agreed to speed up work on the 
following three issues: 1) product origin; 2) mechanism for 
settling disputes; and 3) policy on competition. APEC will 
attempt to push the first two issues on the GATT meeting's 
agenda. New Zealand has been asked to work on the third issue 
and develop a more precise definition. New Zealand made the 
proposal.
