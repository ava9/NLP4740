<F P=106> [Decree: "Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic </F>
of Uzbekistan: `Changes in the Retail Prices for Flour and 
Bread'"] 
  [Text] As a result of the increase in the expenditures for 
purchasing, transporting, and processing grain, the Cabinet of 
Ministers decrees: 
  1. To establish, effective 1 June 1994, retail prices for 
flour at the average of 500 som-coupons and for bread at the 
average of 400 som-coupons per kilogram. 
  2. Republic of Uzbekistan Ministry of Finance is to make 
known to the interested ministries and departments the new 
prices for flour and bread, with a consideration of the variety 
of items being produced. 
  3. To consider to be no longer in effect decree of the 
Republic of Uzbekistan Cabinet of Ministers, dated 28 February 
1994, No. 100. 
  [Signed] A. Mutalov, prime minister of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan 
  Tashkent, 30 May 1994 
  At the Republic of Uzbekistan Ministry of Finance, the 
Uzbeksavdo State Association, and Uzbekbirlashuv 
  Taking into consideration the continuing increase in the 
expenditures to purchase and transport food products from abroad 
and to produce and process the republic's own resources, as well 
as the need to protect the domestic market and thwart attempts 
to ship food products illegally beyond the confines of the 
republic, the Uzbeksavdo State Association and Uzbekbirlashuv, 
jointly with the republic's Ministry of Finance, have decided to 
introduce, effective 1 June 1994, the following average retail 
prices for the basic food products, including those for which 
norms are applied: 
  -- flour: 500 som-coupons per kilogram; 
  -- bread (white, coarse, rye): 400 som-coupons. 
  In conformity with Cabinet of Ministers decree No. 360, as 
long ago as July 1993 the decision was made to release the 
prices for the basic food products. By that decision the 
Uzbeksavdo Association and the board of governors of 
Uzbekbirlashuv, jointly with the republic's Ministry of Finance, 
and proceeding from the current market condition and the actual 
expenditures for purchases, were instructed to establish 
flexible prices for a group of food products to which norms 
would be applied: vegetable oil, sugar, tea, and meat. 
  It must be noted that a considerable quantity of food 
products are brought into the republic from the so-called "near 
and far abroad." Moreover, all types of food products are 
purchased at world prices, only in exchange for freely 
convertible currency. For example, one ton of wheat on the world 
market costs $130, which, recomputed at the official rate of 
exchange, is 500,000 som-coupons. Consequently, a kilogram of 
grain, not counting the cost of shipment, costs the state 500 
som-coupons. Therefore, even with the new prices for bread and 
grain it is necessary to set aside from the state budget every 
month subsidies totally more than 28 billion som-coupons. 
  It is also necessary to emphasize that the new prices for 
the 
basic food products in Uzbekistan, if they are recomputed at the 
exchange rate of the Russian ruble, prove to be lower than, for 
example, in Russia or Kyrgyzstan:

  As a result of the increase in the prices of petroleum and 
other fuel resources that are being delivered to the republic, 
and also for purposes of increasing the effectiveness of the use 
of energy resources and guaranteeing the stable operation of the 
branches of the national economy, new retail prices are being 
introduced, effective 1 June 1994, for fuel and energy resources 
and rates for the services of urban and suburban passenger 
transportation: 


                            Unit of measurement        Retail price (tariff) 
                                                       in som-coupons per

streetcar, trolleybus) 

Hauling of passengers by 
suburban motor buses: 

general type                per kilometer of trip      17 

with upholstered seats      per kilometer of trip      25 


  In addition, the state sets aside considerable subsidies for 
all the types of energy resources and transportation services 
that were indicated above. For example, with a consideration of 
the new prices and tariffs, in terms of one month's 
expenditures, urban passenger transportation will require 
subsidies each month of no less than one billion som-coupons; 
energy producers, 0.7 billion; gas producers, 8.6 billion; and 
coal producers, 3.6 billion som-coupons. Moreover, in Kazakhstan 
the natural gas that is sold to the population is more expensive 
than in our republic (in terms of Russian rubles) by a factor of 
19.2; and in Kyrgyzstan, by a factor of 23.7. 
  For purposes of preserving social guarantees for the 
population, the republic's government regularly reconsiders and 
increases wages, pensions, scholarships, and other payments. By 
the most recent edict of the President, effective 1 June 1994 
the minimum wages and minimum work pensions are established, 
respectively, at 70,000 and 75,000 som-coupons. Wages in 
organizations financed by the budget and scholarships paid to 
students at institutions of higher learning, technicums, and 
occupational-trade schools have been increased by a factor of 
1.5.
