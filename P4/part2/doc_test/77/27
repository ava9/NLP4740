  [Text] Bishkek, 23 Jun -- The economic crisis in Kirghizia 
[Kyrgyzstan] continues to worsen. According to figures 
published today by the National Statistics Committee, total 
output in May fell by 27.8 percent compared with April. 
Sixty-five industrial enterprises have been at a standstill 
since the beginning of the year. Losses at unprofitable 
enterprises amount to 245.6 million soms. 
  Over 30,000 employees are sent on compulsory leave every 
month and about 34,000 are on short time. At the beginning of 
the year about 2,000 people were reporting every month to labor 
exchanges, but by the end of April this figure had doubled, and 
by the beginning of June it had risen to 15,800. Specialists 
reckon that unemployment is becoming a large-scale and chronic 
problem, especially among young people up to the age of 30. 
Since the beginning of the year, this category's share in total 
unemployment has risen by 150 percent. 
  Economic activity continues to decline in all sectors. There 
was a deficit of 298.2 million soms on the consolidated budget 
for the first four months of the year -- this is 10.5 percent of 
gross domestic product. 
  During January-April the Republic earned profit of 370.2 
million soms. But increased prices account for most of this. 
  Things are no better in agriculture. Meat production fell by 
almost 30 percent. Production of eggs has almost completely 
ceased. People have to buy them from private producers. Some 
economists had pinned their hopes on privatization, but they now 
say it is moving in a strange direction. Only 30 percent of the 
population have received vouchers or "shares," as they are 
called in Kirghizia. Even so, these people are in no hurry to 
make use of them. Privatized enterprises are either abandoning 
their original production profile or else coming to a complete 
standstill.
