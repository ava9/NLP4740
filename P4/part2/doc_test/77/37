SOMMER, the French vehicle trim manufacturer, is setting up a second UK
production plant, John Griffiths writes.
The plant, at Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, will employ about 300 people
with production expected to start in the summer. It will supply interior
parts to Toyota's nearby plant at Burnaston, Derbyshire.
Sommer already has a factory next to Nissan's car facility at Washington,
Tyne and Wear, to which it supplies interior trim on a just-in-time basis.
