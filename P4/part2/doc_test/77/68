  [Text] An honest man who is sent abroad to lie for his 
country -- that is how diplomats were defined in rougher times. 
Since French Ambassador Francois Scheer let off steam at a Bonn 
meeting with journalists last week this definition has had to be 
altered: The diplomat is a paragon of discretion who is sent 
abroad to commit indiscretions in the interest of his country. 
  The ambassador let it be understood that the ghosts of the 
past had risen once again. The differences over the 
nonparticipation of the chancellor in the commemorative 
ceremonies in Normandy and Bonn's refusal to allow the Allies to 
stage a farewell military parade in Berlin should be viewed 
against a "background of general mistrust." France needs 
"clarity from Germany" that nothing will change about Germany's 
place in West Europe as a result of the transfer of the seat of 
the government to Berlin, relations of a new kind with Russia, 
and the expansion of the European Union [EU] to the north and 
the East. There is much that still has to be done for 
reconciliation to develop into friendship. 
  This has caused a minor tempest in a teapot. There were few 
signs of perceptiveness -- according to Max Weber, "the ability 
to allow reality to affect one while remaining calm and 
collected" -- in German reactions and commentaries. There are 
three points that need to be set out and contrasted with that. 
  First, in view of differing national interests, 
temperaments, 
and memories, the Franco-German relationship remains difficult. 
However, as it has evolved over the past few decades, it is 
enduring enough to survive temporary irritations. It is not -- 
regardless of ambassadorial garrulousness or ministerial 
bluntness -- in trouble at the present time. 
  Just as the Maastricht Treaty was a product of a 
Franco-German initiative, there are many other things that have 
emerged from joint Franco-German efforts since then: The 
European Council's Copenhagen resolution, which opens up 
prospects for admission for the countries of Central and East 
Europe; the decision to offer the countries of the East 
cooperation with the Western European Union [WEU] to supplement 
the Partnership for Peace; and the Kinkel-Juppe proposal for 
Bosnia, which the Americans have made their own in the meantime. 
  There are countless examples of successful cooperation -- 
the 
GATT negotiations, which the Germans helped to lead to a 
successful conclusion without France losing face; the subtle way 
in which France was brought into NATO via the Eurocorps; the 
close coordination of the two EU presidencies, Germany first and 
then France, with an emphasis on drawing East Europe into the 
Brussels community and promoting stability in the entire Eastern 
region. 
  Second, it is true the Germans have still not found their 
role in the world following the Cold War, reunification, and 
communism. We still do not know what we should want. However, 
that is no less true of the French. The ECONOMIST diagnosis 
was: "The old certainties regarding national solidarity and 
cultural integrity, especially things connected with France's 
place in Europe, which is continuing to develop, have collapsed. 
They have been replaced by worry." 
  Paris feels it has been forced to the periphery. For a long 
time, it has called on the Germans to finally assume a degree of 
responsibility that is commensurate with its size and influence. 
However, as soon as the government prepared to do just that, the 
ghost of a German desire to achieve a dominant position loomed. 
Sometimes, this concern almost sounds like Clemenceau's caustic 
Gallic complaint that there are "20 million Germans too many." 
  These fears on both sides must be discussed -- the German 
fear of being made to stand in the corner once again and French 
fears that if the focus of Bonn policies shifts to the north and 
the East, then France will be forced to the sidelines of the 
European arena. Klaus Kinkel must initiate such a dialogue in 
Paris this week. 
  Third, in view of the uncertainty surrounding the future, 
there may be a temptation to seek refuge in the hackneyed 
certainties of the past. The ceremonies that are planned to 
mark the 50th anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandy 
smack of anachronism; there is a feel of smoke-filled back rooms 
in which veterans associations preserve past memories about 
them, of regimental rooms where relics of the past are 
displayed. The chancellor is not to be present as if victory 
over the Germans were being celebrated rather than a triumph 
over Nazi ideology. Why is one staging a retrospective of this 
last great battle rather than celebrating European union? 
  The government is in a huff ("concerning ceremony for the 
end 
of World War II: German presence is not envisaged"). The 
chancellor is having rumors spread that one cannot expect him to 
take part in an event that involves celebrating the defeat of 
Germany. How can this stupid statement be reconciled with 
Bonn's secret desire to be present? That would only be possible 
if it were admitted that 6 July 1994 marked the beginning of 
defeat and Germany's liberation from the Nazi yoke. However, 
making that kind of statement is something that many in Bonn 
still find distasteful. 
  "Ten centuries of European history are visible in the 
background" is how Ambassador Scheer explained French mistrust. 
Is the point not that real history should now be made out of 
past events? Should one not heed Nietzsche's words of warning: 
"There is a degree of sleeplessness, of ruminating on things, 
of historical awareness that drives life out of things to the 
point of its extinction." 
  Last fall, Helmut Kohl spoke about Franco-German friendship 
before the Senate in Paris. He said on that occasion that not 
all the evil spirits of the past had been banished in Europe 
once and for all. Every generation faces the task of preventing 
their return anew, of shedding old prejudices, of allaying 
suspicion. Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman 
Rudolf Scharping expressed himself in very similar terms 
recently. He advised that Bonn foreign policy should display 
clarity with regard to substance, modesty and restraint in its 
style, and sensitivity toward neighbors. The meaning of the 
criticism leveled by the French ambassador, who is a 
dyed-in-the-wool European, was not that different. The dialogue 
that he has called for is not only due, it is overdue. In the 
Europe of the future, a Europe of Romance, Germanic, and Slavic 
peoples, Germany and France constitute the indispensable hinge 
between north and south and East and West. This hinge needs to 
be oiled urgently.
