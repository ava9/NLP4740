Surrender: young members of the Wehrmacht - from D-Day: The Climactic Battle
of World War II by Stephen E Ambrose (Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 20)
It was with foreboding that I tackled this clutch of books about D-Day and
the Normandy landings. There was little reason to suppose that the familiar
story would be improved by the hoop-la of the 50th anniversary.
And yet, the D-Day landings were an amazing event. It was the biggest
sea-borne invasion in history, the product of an extraordinary combination
of intelligence, deception, secrecy, inventiveness, planning, engineering,
logistics, discipline and bravery.
None of this would have been able to overcome the fearful odds, if the
operation had not been over-arched by an astonishing depth and intensity of
international co-operation and military integration between the allies,
which laid the foundations for Europe's security throughout the next 50
years.
If you want to know the essential story, I cannot imagine a better place to
begin than the Penguin Atlas of D-Day (Viking / Penguin, 143 pages, Pounds
17 in hardback, Pounds 10 in paperback). This is a superbly produced little
book, with excellent maps in colour, which illuminate every aspect of the
operation from the planning to the armada, from the landings to the
bridgehead, right through to the end of the Normandy campaign 10 weeks
later. If you are a military history buff, and want to trace the movements
of an individual division, the index gives a reference to relevant maps and
text.
The text is the real bonus. I had expected the words to be no more than a
make-shift skeleton of facts, filling in the spaces between the maps. In
fact, it is a sizzling narrative, told with verve and drama by John Man; and
he skilfully intersperses the detailed account of events on the battlefield
with glimpses of the larger picture and stimulating judgments which avoid
any taint of patriotic prejudice.
David Evans' Guide to the Beaches and Battlefields of Normandy (Michael
Joseph, Pounds 14.99, 186 pages) is a more pedestrian affair. It is
obviously intended as a utilitarian handbook for military tourists or
relatives of men who fought in Normandy. There is a short historical
section, but the book is mainly devoted to an alphabetical gazetteer of
villages and towns in Normandy, with brief thumb-nail sketches of their
associations with the campaign, and their war memorials and museums.
Unfortunately, the maps and diagrams, in black and white, are rather crude.
If it is true that a picture is worth a thousand words, then a book of
photographs of the invasion ought to give the vividest possible impression
of a great and dramatic event. The curious thing about D-Day: the Invasion
in Photographs (edited by Tony Hall, Salamander, Pounds 4.99, 64 pages,
paperback) is that the overall impression is rather confused and unfocussed.
Perhaps this is because this book does not include the best selection of the
available photographs. Or perhaps it is unavoidable that the dominant
impression through the lens is the fog of battle; it is only afterwards that
the researcher can reconstruct the drama and its meaning - which must be
conveyed in words.
Russell Miller's Nothing Less Than Victory (Penguin, Pounds 7.99, 496 pages,
paperback), is in its way a verbal equivalent of the book of photographs,
because this is an oral history of the invasion, told afterwards by men
(from both sides) who were there. Some of the extracts are drawn from books
or other published sources. But most of them are from interviews conducted
by the author, and cumulatively they give a powerful impression of what it
was like to be alive in 1944, to be young, and to be at war.
D-Day 1944 (by Robin Neillands and Roderick de Normann, Orion, Pounds 5.99,
320 pages, paperback) is another attempt to tell the story of the invasion
in the words of men who were there. But where Russell Miller leaves the
extracts to speak for themselves, Neillands and de Normann have woven their
first-hand sources into a seamless story. This is warfare at ground level,
and a vivid and frightening experience for all these terribly young men.
Someone took a lot of trouble to liven up the page layouts in D-Day: the
Normandy Landings and the Liberation of Europe (Anthony Kemp, Thames and
Hudson, Pounds 6.95, 194 pages, paperback). Unfortunately, the effect is so
busy, with different type-sizes and different types of illustration
inter-twining with the text on every page, that the result is difficult to
read. Anthony Kemp has produced a straightforward narrative, but the visual
confusion does not help, even if many of the illustrations are striking.
The attraction of a first-hand account of war, such as Geoffrey Picot's
Accidental Warrior (Penguin, Pounds 6.99, 318 pages paperback) or Alastair
Borthwick's Battalion (Baton Wicks, Pounds 16.99, 270 pages) is that it can
give a powerful impression of what it was like to be there; the drawback is
that personal knowledge is almost invariably confined to a small perimeter:
the individual soldier knows little of the battle, and almost nothing of the
campaign.
Geoffrey Picot, a 19-year-old infantry officer in Normandy, makes this
explicit. 'Those who get their picture of a battle from films where
seemingly hundreds of rival soldiers are packed into a few hundred square
yards may have difficulty imagining a real battlefield. You and a couple of
pals can be hundreds of yards from anybody else; you may not have much idea
where friend or foe are. You fire from a concealed position to a hidden
target. And how on earth do you find out what is going on?'
Accidental Warrior has been praised by soldiers. I found it a bit too
stiff-upper-lip; as Russell Miller found when he was interviewing for his
oral history, the English were less ready to admit to any real feelings than
the Americans.
Borthwick, however, has a turn for engaging humour. 'Egg-hunting was the
only sport possible in St Honorine, and it was pursued so diligently by the
garrison that some claimed eggs were snatched before they even touched the
straw. All the hens certainly had a harassed look . . . You had to follow
the hen into the hen-house and sit staring it out of countenance until it
had laid, because if you took your eyes off it for a second someone came in
and robbed you.' Battalion was published in 1946, under the title Sans Peur;
it deserves its re-issue.
Decision in Normandy, by the American military historian Carlo d'Este
(Harper Collins, Pounds 10.99, 558 pages, paperback) is another welcome
reissue. First published in 1983, it is detailed, comprehensive, deeply
researched, penetrating, and well written; it has become and will doubtless
long remain one of the classic accounts of the Normandy campaign.
