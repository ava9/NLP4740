  [Text] Jakarta -- Foreign Minister Ali Alatas was admitted 
to a Jakarta hospital's intensive cardiac care unit on Wednesday 
for what officials would only say was "fatigue". 
  Dr. Budi Trisulo, Mr. Alatas' personal physician, confirmed 
yesterday that the 61-year old foreign minister had been 
hospitalized but declined to say more. 
  ANTARA National News Agency quoted Foreign Ministry 
spokesman 
Irawan Abidin as saying that doctors have ordered Mr. Alatas, a 
heavy smoker, to take a complete rest for at least two weeks. 
  That would mean that Mr. Alatas, who was appointed foreign 
minister in 1988, would be unable to attend a meeting of the 
Indonesia-Malaysia joint ministerial commission in Kuala Lumpur. 
He had also been scheduled to fly from Malaysia to Egypt to 
attend a meeting of the Nonaligned Movement's foreign ministers. 
  A key point on the Cairo agenda is the question of who 
succeeds Indonesia next year as chairman of the 110-strong 
movement.
