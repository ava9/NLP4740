  [Text] Jakarta, Jun 6 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Visiting German 
Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Carl-Dieter 
Spranger on Sunday blasted as "unrealistic" the proposed ban on 
the import of tropical wood products and said the ban will 
impede the conservation of tropical forests which serve as the 
lung of the earth. 
  "If the ban on the import of tropical wood products is 
effective, these forest products might give no economic 
advantage to countries which have tropical forests, and that 
they will find it difficult to conserve their forests," Spranger 
told the press at the Sukarno-Hatta airport a moment before he 
left for home. 
  Environmentalists in the United States and Europe have 
proposed that their governments impose a ban on the import of 
tropical wood products from developing countries. 
  Spranger said he had seen for himself Indonesia's 
well-planned efforts to conserve its forests without necessarily 
sacrificing the ecosystem. 
  It was natural for Indonesia which had huge tropical forests 
to utilize its natural resources, including tropical forests, he 
said. 
  Earlier, Forestry Minister Jamaludin Suryohadikusumo briefed 
the German minister on the management of Indonesian tropical 
forests. Spranger also visited tropical forests in East 
Kalimantan during his stay. 
  According to Spranger, the Indonesian Government was 
determined to conserve its tropical forests while exploiting 
part of them to gain foreign exchange earnings. 
  He said he was in support of Indonesia's efforts to 
disseminate objective information on the management of tropical 
forests in developing countries. 
  In 1993, Indonesia exported an estimated nine million cubic 
meters of tropical wood worth U.S.$6.5 billion. Japan was the 
biggest market for Indonesian tropical wood, followed by the 
United States and European countries. 
  Spranger said Germany was prepared to provide the Indonesian 
Government with technical assistance to manage its tropical 
forests.
