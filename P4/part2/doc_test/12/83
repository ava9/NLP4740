<F P=106> [Article by 'Umar Idris: "Saudi Arabia's Al-Fawzan Company </F>
Imports 10,000 Tonnes of Iron from Turkey; Value of 1993 Sales 
Is $237 Million"] 
  [Text] Jeddah--Khalid 'Abd-al-Latif al-Fawzan, western 
province general director for 'Abd-al-Latif and Muhammad 
al-Fawzan Company, has announced that last year the company 
recorded sales of 890 million riyals ($237 million). He also 
told AL-HAYAH that the company concluded its latest deal last 
month, importing 10,000 tonnes of iron, valued at $3 million 
[figure as published], from Turkey to meet clients' urgent 
needs. Al-Fawzan also noted that the company imported nearly 
40,000 tonnes of iron last year. It also imported 7,000 cubic 
meters of lumber, valued at nearly 6 million riyals ($1.6 
million), from Romania last month. 
  He expressed the opinion that it is unlikely that there is a 
crisis in the demand for iron in the Saudi market, saying, "The 
crisis started in 1991 and ended in 1993." 
  Khalid al-Fawzan estimated that Saudi Arabia imports nearly 
500,000 cubic meters of wood annually, with an estimated value 
of $1 billion. 
  He noted that Saudi Arabia imports white [soft] wood from 
Austria, Canada, Romania, Russia, Chile, Sweden, and Finland and 
red wood (hard wood) from Africa. It also imports plywood from 
Malaysia and Indonesia. Khalid noted that "tree age determines 
lumber prices. The average price per cubic meter is nearly $200." 
  He further noted that al-Fawzan Company imports nearly 
70,000 
cubic meters of white wood, 90,000 cubic meters of hard wood, 
and 45,000 cubic meters of plywood. He also pointed out that 
lumber imports have been growing steadily since 1986. 
  Khalid al-Fawzan further said, "Lumber prices have been 
rising constantly. In recent years these prices were half what 
they are now." He attributed the increase to the growth in 
forest cutting and decreasing world wood reserves, considering 
that the average age of trees in Russia is 180, in Canada and 
Austria 150, and in Chile 70 years. This means that the younger 
generations are the ones that will benefit from these trees. 
  Al-Fawzan pointed out that Brazil and Indonesia have reduced 
their tree cutting operations and that Malaysia is moving in the 
same direction, which means that prices will rise with the onset 
of the year 2000. He also noted that the company owns three 
factories that produce wooden platforms and luxury furniture and 
decor [wood panels] in Jeddah and that the total investment in 
these factories is 29 million riyals ($7.7 million). 
  The factories produce frames into which concrete is poured. 
The factories also cover 90 percent of the market need for 
wooden platforms in the western, southern, and northern 
provinces of Saudi Arabia. Al-Dammam factory for wooden 
platforms covers the needs of the eastern province and Riyadh. 
  The company also plans to introduce another line to produce 
annually 671,000 wood panels that meet Brazilian standards, 
which are required by the Saudi market. A similar type of decor 
panels is produced currently at the rate of 743,000 units 
annually. The company also produces 56,000 16-mm polyester units 
and 68,000 18-mm units annually. A total of 559,000 units of 
wooden platforms were produced last year. The company also 
produced 15,000 wooden boxes to meet the needs of companies that 
package their products, including al-Jafali Company, and 12,000 
wooden molds to meet the need of domestic companies that produce 
concrete blocks. 
  Al-Fawzan also said that the Red Sea Plant for the 
production 
of prefabricated homes and al-Nur Company are major clients for 
the products turned out by al-Fawzan Company. An urgent request 
by the Red Sea Plant for panels in various colors was met by 
al-Fawzan Company at the end of last year, with the request 
delivered by air.
