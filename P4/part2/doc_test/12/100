  [Text] Thailand may elect to exclude some petrochemical 
products from AFTA [ASEAN Free Trade Area] liberalisation if 
Indonesia and Malaysia insist on doing the same said an informed 
Finance Ministry source. 
  Thailand keeps petrochemical industries under the ASEAN Free 
Trade Area normal track while Indonesia and Malaysia keep these 
industries on an exclusion list, added the source. However, 
Thailand will not include all petrochemical products in the 
exclusion list -- only locally-made products will be protected, 
he noted. 
  The source commented that Singapore stands to gain 
advantages 
over its neighbouring countries in these industries as it has 
more fully integrated its industries. The source noted that 
Singaporean products would flood the three countries if import 
taxes were diminished. 
  Malaysia has systematically developed its petrochemical 
industries while Indonesia has only six downstream petrochemical 
industries, explained the source. However, Brunei and the 
Philippines have not established petrochemical industries, noted 
the source. Thailand will keep petrochemical industries under 
an exclusion list but plans to reduce the protection period from 
eight to five years. 
  According to the source, the list of the protected items are 
ethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, polystrylene, 
polypropylene, and propylene. The source confirmed that today's 
AFTA meeting, chaired by Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin, 
will consider this matter among other issues. 
  The studies conducted by the Ministry of Finance indicate 
that it is necessary to support the Thai petrochemical industry 
as it is a major basic industry and is only in its early 
development stages, noted the source. The source said if 
Malaysia and Indonesia accept a Ministry of Finance proposal to 
keep their petrochemical industries under the normal track, the 
Ministry would develop alternatives to help the emerging 
industries faced with a high interest rate burden. 
  The agenda for the AFTA meeting today will consider ways to 
expedite the realisation of the free trade area from 15 to 10-12 
years, to include consideration on non-processed agricultural 
products, said the source. The source conceded that 
disagreement among ASEAN members continues on the definition of 
the terms "processed" and "non-processed" goods. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak has proposed 
that Thailand withdraw some petrochemical products from the 
normal track to the exclusion list if other ASEAN countries 
decide to add their products to the exclusion list. 
  According to Dr Suphachai, if Thailand could successfully 
negotiate with the two countries to bring the petrochemical 
industries under the normal track, Thailand could accept the 
Malaysian request that it keep palm oil under the normal track. 
  Previously the Thai Government proposed to keep the 
petrochemical industry under the fast track, however, it has 
decided to keep the industry under the normal track. 
  The local production cost of the Thai industry is higher 
than 
imports regardless of upstream, intermediate or downstream 
industries. The reason cited is expensive local raw materials 
and the fact that production has not achieved economy of scale.
