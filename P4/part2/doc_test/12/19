  [Text] Jakarta, Jan. 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia and 
Indonesia Saturday signed an investment guarantee agreement 
[IGA] to encourage the private sectors of both countries to 
optimise the huge potential available in economic and industrial 
cooperation. 
  The agreement on promotion and protection of investments was 
signed by Malaysian Minister of International Trade and Industry 
Rafidah Aziz and Indonesian Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Susilo Sudarman, who is defence and security minister. 
  Speaking to reporters after the signing ceremony, Rafidah 
urged the Malaysian and Indonesian private sectors to follow up 
with joint ventures to exploit the vast economic opportunities 
available in the two countries. 
  Rafidah, who is here for a two-day visit, also called on 
entrepreneurs of the two countries to synergise their capacity 
to invest in third countries which are opening up their 
economies like Cambodia, Vietnam, and the People's Republic of 
China. 
  She said they had developed the capacity in fields like 
electronics, oil, and gas engineering and by combining their 
resources they could strongly bid for tenders in third countries. 
  Susilo, describing the agreement as timely, said the 
Indonesian Government was looking forward to more joint ventures 
between Indonesian and Malaysian businessmen, especially with 
the implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). 
  Rafidah said ASEAN had already signed an umbrella IGA in 
1987, but this bilateral agreement showed that the two 
governments were serious in forging greater cooperation between 
their private sectors. 
  She said trade between the two countries and the awareness 
of 
trade opportunities among their businessmen in both countries 
were increasing, but they should be more aggressive as the trade 
base was still small in proportion to the potentials. 
  Total trade between the two countries had increased from 
U.S. 
$199 million worth in 1985 to U.S. $1.139 billion in 1992, but 
it only accounted for 1.4 percent of Malaysia's total global 
trade, she added. 
  Indonesia's investment in Malaysia up to December 1992 stood 
at U.S. $1.28 billion, but out of 800 investment projects 
approved last year, only three were Indonesian. 
  Malaysia's investment in Indonesia now stood at U.S. $166 
million in 32 projects, mainly in wood industry, food, metal, 
and textiles. 
  Rafidah Friday held talks with Trade Minister Billy Yudono 
on 
bilateral, regional, and global trade matters and with Minister 
of Research and Technology B.J. Habibie on cooperation in 
aerospace industry. 
  Earlier Saturday, she held discussions with Minister of 
Industry Tungky Aribowo on, among others, bilateral trade 
relations and the forthcoming informal meeting of ASEAN economic 
ministers in Kuala Lumpur on April 22.
