COUNTRIES of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Malaysia,
Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Brunei) have expressed
their concern about a recent move by Austria imposing mandatory labelling on
all tropical timber imports.
Mr Sanusi Junid, Malaysia's agriculture minister, said the Austrian action
went against the spirit and content of an agreement reached at the Earth
Summit in Rio on the management, conservation and sustainable development of
all types of forests.
Asean took a serious view of the Austrian action, he added. It had agreed to
adopt a common stand on the issue, to dissuade other countries from making
similar moves against tropical timber products. 'We are of the opinion that
if such action is to be imposed, it should also involve temperate timber.'
Malaysia, the world's leading exporter of tropical timber, has been at the
forefront of a campaign aimed at countering concern about continued logging
in the tropical rain forests.
It says much of the developed world's criticism about forestry management in
Malaysia and other countries is ill informed.
