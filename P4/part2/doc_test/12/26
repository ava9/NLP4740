</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Urinating on its pursuers from the tree tops, a Sumatran orangutan shows no 
sign of wanting to leave its home, a scrap of jungle in the middle of a cocoa 
plantation. 
</P>
<P>
The plantation is inexorably expanding, however, and what is left of the furry 
red animal's habitat will soon be providing beans for the chocolate lovers of 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
The hapless clutch of people wielding chain saw and nets under the tree were 
part of a project sponsored by the World Wide Fund for Nature to save the 
threatened apes by moving them to forests safe from cocoa farmers, developers, 
loggers and animal traders. 
</P>
<P>
The orangutan rules the jungles of Indonesia and Malaysia, where it has no 
natural enemies except r man. 
</P>
<P>
A baby stays with its mother for years, clinging with little hands onto her 
long chest fur as she swings from tree to tree. It is helpless without her, and 
she protects it fiercely. 
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia it is illegal either to keep baby apes as pets or to trade in the 
animal internationally. 
</P>
<P>
A live baby fetches $190 locally, four times that in Jakarta, and up to $5,000 
in New York, according to a local forestry official. 
</P>
<P>
It is not hard to capture a baby orangutan. Shoot the mother and you have the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
Trapping an adult is a different story, however. 
</P>
<P>
Drive it up a tree, cut off its escape route by felling the surrounding trees, 
and then chop down the tree it sits in. The orangutan will scuttle down the 
swaying trunk straight into the waiting nets. Easy. 
</P>
<P>
Or so the textbook says. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen the way orangutans operate in the wild," said Michael Griffiths, the 
nature fund's representative in Sumatra's main city, Medan. 
</P>
<P>
"They sit up there staking out the scene from their vantage point and then come 
down and make off through an opening no one on the ground even thought of." 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, annoyed by net handlers yelling instructions and dogs yapping at 
the base of the tree, one orangutan slid down the trunk and lumbered off into 
the bushes, dogs following. 
</P>
<P>
It paused long enough to turn and give the dogs a withering look, then sped up 
another tree. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually two orangutans were caught and taken off the plantation. 
</P>
<P>
"The plantation called us in instead of just going out and shooting the animals 
or leaving them to die as they cleared the land. That's a real step forward," 
Griffiths said. 
</P>
<P>
The apes were released in Gunung Leuser National Park, near the nature fund's 
north Sumatra Orangutan Rehabilitation Station. 
</P>
<P>
The station also gets young orangutans when they have been seized by the 
authorities from captivity or when they outgrow their welcome as pets and are 
turned in. 
</P>
<P>
"As pets, they don't know anything (about survival). We have to teach them to 
climb, to hunt for food," a field worker named Ketut said. 
</P>
<P>
After a short time in quarantine to rid them of ailments unknown in the jungle, 
and basic training in the art of swinging on vines, they are taken to the 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
There, on a platform up a tree, fieldworkers feed them a daily diet of milk and 
bananas. 
</P>
<P>
"Bananas, bananas, bananas. A very boring diet, and we (intentionally) never 
give them quite enough," Ketut said. "That way they get bored and hungry and go 
off hunting on their own." 
</P>
<P>
Forays for more interesting food take the animals farther and farther afield. 
Some stop coming back to the feeding place of their own accord, some need a 
little encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
"We lug them off into the forest, sometimes five days' walk away, where they 
can have their own territory," Ketut said. 
</P>
<P>
With its 3,100 square miles of land, Gunung Leuser park gives the apes plenty 
of protected territory to choose from. The nature fund estimates there are 
about 2,000 orangutans in Sumatra, and another 5,000 in Indonesian and 
Malaysian Borneo. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to protect the beasts has gone international. Six orangutans 
intercepted in Bangkok on their way to Yugoslavia were returned to Jakarta in 
late May. 
</P>
<P>
"We're serious about this," forestry official Ajisasmito said. "If we find any 
more Indonesian orangutans abroad, we will extradite them too."
