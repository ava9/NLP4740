  [Text] Jakarta, May 19 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- Research and 
Technology Minister B.J. Habibie said Thursday ASEAN amity could 
be significantly fostered by cooperation in technology and human 
resources development. He said ASEAN member countries had a 
political commitment to undertake the improvement of the quality 
of their human resources in ways compatible with "the ASEAN 
spirit." 
  The minister was speaking at a ceremony marking the signing 
of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on cooperation in various 
fields between Indonesia and Malaysia. 
  Habibie signed the document for Indonesia, while Malaysian 
Defence Minister Datuk Sri Mohamed Najib bin Tun Abdul Razak did 
the same for Malaysia. 
  Several other Indonesia-Malaysia accords were also inked at 
the ceremony. One was between the state-owned aircraft-making 
company IPTN and the Malaysian Defence Department and another 
between the Indonesian Air Force and Malaysia's Airod [company 
speciliazing in aircraft repairs and overhaul]. 
  ASEAN unity or solidarity has lately become a topic of 
public 
discussion following the emergence of a difference of views 
between Jakarta and Manila about the scheduled holding of a 
seminar on East Timor in Manila. 
  According to spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Affairs 
Ministry Irawan Abidin, the Philippine Government could not meet 
Indonesia's demand that the meeting be called off but had 
promised it would try to have the topics to be discussed at the 
proposed seminar limited. 
  Malaysia was among several countries which disagreed with 
the 
plan and said such a seminar was an effort to damage ASEAN 
friendship. 
  In response to President Suharto's statement on the 
possibility of marketing Malaysia's Proton Saga cars at 
relatively low price in Indonesia, Habibie said that it was a 
breakthrough which was expected to bring this archipelagic 
country to the technology of the future. 
  President Suharto had reportedly told Razak at a meeting 
Thursday the Malaysian cars can be sold in Indonesia, especially 
if the cars use components made in Indonesia.
