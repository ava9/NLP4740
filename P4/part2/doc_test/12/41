DEVELOPING COUNTRIES will call for timber trade rules to be extended to
non-tropical countries at today's meeting in Quito, Ecuador to negotiate a
new timber treaty.
The 1985 International Tropical Timber Agreement expires in 1994, and its 50
signatories, which include countries with more than 90 per cent of the
world's remaining tropical rainforests as well as most of the non-tropical
forests, have been divided about the form of a new treaty.
The Malaysian and Indonesian governments have indicated that they will press
for new rules, which will cover how fast forests can be cut down, to apply
to all forests. Developing countries have also called for the new treaty to
cover pricing of timber. At the previous meeting in Japan in November,
developed countries including the US, Canada and the European Community were
highly reluctant to adopt the new proposals.
The UK government's position in the negotiations is that to widen the treaty
would be to lose its focus on preserving rainforests. Mr Michael James of
the UK Timber Trade Federation, which advises the UK government on the
discussions, said yesterday: 'The agreement would change character
considerably if extended and there could be administrative problems - the
organisation is already overstretched'.
