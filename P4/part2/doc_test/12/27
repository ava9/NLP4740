FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (14): Warfare escalates over use of the
tropical forests - Timber exporters feel ecologists' wrath

LATE last year Austria made moves to introduce eco-labelling on tropical
timber products. Such was the reaction in Kuala Lumpur it seemed Malaysia
was about to dispatch its troops to hammer in protest on the gates of
Vienna.
'If the Austrian government insists on eco-labelling tropical timber based
products, Malaysia will retaliate in the same manner,' thundered Mr Lim Keng
Yaik, Malaysia's minister for primary industries. 'For example, we can
eco-label their chocolate products that are produced at dirty factories,'
said Mr Lim.
Austria has since modified its stand, but the tropical timber issue refuses
to go away. Various governments and environmental groups accuse Malaysia,
the world's biggest exporter of tropical timber, of raping its forests and
threatening the lives of forest dwellers.
Malaysia accuses its critics, particularly in the west, of hypocrisy and of
practising double standards.
Mr Wong Kum Choon is chief executive of the Malaysian timber industry
development council (MTIDC) a body set up by the government and timber
industry to counteract adverse publicity.
'Our critics often don't want to listen to the other side of the argument,'
says Mr Wong. 'They think we only look at forests in terms of money. They
don't realise Malaysia's own concerns about preserving its forests and
managing its timber industry effectively.'
Timber is an important part of the Malaysian economy. According to MTIDC
statistics, timber and timber products are the country's second biggest
commodity export earner after petroleum products. In 1992 Malaysia exported
more than MDollars 10bn (Dollars 4bn) worth of timber and products,
accounting for 10 per cent of total export earnings.
About 40 per cent of timber exports are in the form of logs. Sarawak, in
east Malaysia, accounts for nearly 80 per cent of log exports and it is here
that environmental attention is focused.
The statistical arguments go back and forth. The World Bank has estimated
that trees are being cut down in Sarawak at four times the sustainable rate.
The MTIDC says this is untrue: it says Sarawak has 70 per cent of its land
area under forests. Some areas are totally protected, other areas are being
cleared for various uses while about half is being logged on a selective,
sustainable, basis.
Mr Abdul Taib Mahmud, Sarawak's chief minister for more than 10 years,
recently said that logging in his state had been substantially reduced,
resulting in a loss of Dollars 50m per year in revenues to the state
government and the disappearance of thousands of jobs.
Critics do not believe Mr Taib. They accuse the chief minister of working
hand in glove with the logging companies and timber tycoons. They say that
the federal government allows Mr Taib free rein in exchange for his ongoing
support of the governing Barisan Nasional political grouping. The two sides
slug it out. There seems little room for compromise. 'Timber and human
rights are the most sensitive subjects in Malaysia,' says a former
government official. 'As long as there are forests and people the arguments
will continue.'
