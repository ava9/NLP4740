Proton, the Malaysian car manufacturer, has won its first export order in
Indonesia. Under a memorandum of understanding signed in Jakarta, Indonesia
will import between 1,500 and 3,000 Protons, which will be used as taxis.
The Proton sale forms part of a complex trade and investment deal being
negotiated between Malaysia and Indonesia.
Under agreements signed during a visit to Indonesia last week by Mr Anwar
Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy prime minister and finance minister, Malaysia
will contribute Dollars 50m to a joint venture capital company which will
seek to develop small and medium-scale industries in Indonesia.
Negotiations are also under way on the possible sale to Malaysia of a number
of Indonesian transport aircraft, made by the state owned Industri Pesawat
Terban Nusantara, while Malaysia hopes to sell its own light trainer
aircraft to Jakarta.
Malaysia has said it is investigating the manufacture of Proton components
in Indonesia in order to avoid Indonesian car import duties of more than 200
per cent.
PT Citra Lamtoro, a company controlled by Mrs Hardijanti Rukmana, the
daughter of Indonesian President Suharto, is to import the Protons into
Indonesia.
A brother of Mrs Rukmana is already involved in car assembly operations in
Indonesia while another brother is part of an Indonesian group which
recently purchased the Lamborghini car company from Chrysler of the US.
