  [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Wed -- The Cabinet has accepted 
Indonesia's offer of a new NAS-332 Super Puma helicopter to 
replace a similar aircraft used by the Royal Malaysian Air Force 
[RMAF] which crashed near Sungai Petani, Kedah, on December 31 
last year, killing the crew of four. 
  Defence Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said the Cabinet 
at its weekly meeting today accepted the offer as it was a sign 
of goodwill from the Indonesian Government. [passage omitted] 
  "However, the RMAF will evaluate the technical aspects of 
the 
Super Puma and its after sales support before taking delivery of 
it," Najib said. 
  He said this to newsmen after receiving Brunei's Navy 
commander Colonel Pehin Datuk Paduka Kefli at his office in 
Jalan Padang Tembak. 
  Earlier, Pehin met Royal Malaysian Navy chief Laksamana 
Madya 
[Rear Admiral] Datuk Sri Shariff Ishak. [passage omitted] 
  On Pehin's visit, Najib offered to train more Brunei navy 
personnel here and build naval warships for them. [passage 
omitted]
