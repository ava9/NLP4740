<P>
Far from bold leadership, President George Bush made a cautiously calculated 
choice in naming Judge David H. Souter to succeed Justice William J. Brennan 
Jr. The President knows that virtually anyone he might nominate will push the 
U.S. Supreme Court in even more sharply conservative directions on abortion, 
affirmative action and a few other issues where Brennan has been able to 
maintain bare majorities in support of individual rights. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Bush distanced himself from his popular predecessor by disclaiming 
that his nominee passed any "litmus test." Whereas Ronald Reagan made 
judgeships symbols and instruments of his presidential power, Bush aims to 
avoid conflict and win reelection. Like other past Republican Presidents in 
political trouble and confronted with making a tough appointment, Bush appeals 
to the professionalism of his obscure nominee. In short, Bush punts. 
</P>
<P>
The President, to be sure, contrived to inspire confidence by announcing his 
choice just three days after Brennan brought to an end 34 years of service on 
the court. Few Presidents have moved so quickly. Most wait a month or more 
before announcing their decisions. But Lyndon B. Johnson holds the record for 
speed: He named his solicitor general, Thurgood Marshall, just a day after 
Justice Tom C. Clark resigned. 
</P>
<P>
At their own peril, Presidents race ahead before fully checking their nominees' 
qualifications and backgrounds. Reagan learned that in 1987, when searching to 
replace retiring Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. At the time, Powell was considered 
pivotal, because he cast the crucial vote for upholding abortion and 
affirmative-action programs. Unlike Bush, however, Reagan stuck to his 
ideological guns. After the Senate overwhelmingly rejected his first nominee, 
Judge Robert H. Bork, the President hastily pressed ahead by naming Judge 
Douglas H. Ginsburg, instead of the low-key and solidly conservative federal 
Judge Anthony M. Kennedy. Only when Ginsburg was forced to withdraw, amid 
revelations that he had smoked marijuana, did Reagan settle on Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
However swift, Bush's move also lacks the self-assurance of a Reagan or a 
Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1937, F.D.R. retaliated against the court for 
overturning, by 5-4 votes, much of his New Deal program. He proposed to enlarge 
the number of justices from nine to 15, thereby securing a majority favorable 
to him. Then, surprisingly, a justice changed his mind and the court upheld, by 
a 5-4 margin, major pieces of New Deal legislation. That contributed to the 
Senate's defeat of his "court-packing plan," but F.D.R. remained vindictive and 
committed to turning the court in new directions. When he got the first of 
eight chances to fill vacancies, Roosevelt named Sen. Hugo L. Black, who had 
led the fight for the court expansion and was one of the court's sharpest 
critics. Unlike Bush, Roosevelt was not content to "let things happen." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, moreover, runs the risk that something unexpected about Souter may turn 
up. He is banking on the investigation conducted by the American Bar Assn. six 
months ago, when Bush put Souter on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First 
Circuit. Souter was rated "well qualified." 
</P>
<P>
But Richard M. Nixon made that mistake by too quickly jumping to G. Harrold 
Carswell in 1970. Although sailing through the confirmation process to a seat 
on the appellate bench, Carswell was roasted in the Senate when shortly after 
his nomination to the court, certain racist speeches he'd made decades earlier 
were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
While denying that his nominee is "Bush-league," the President nevertheless 
picked a little known (and hence presumably non-controversial) conservative. In 
passing over more qualified and experienced candidates, he feared the 
possibility of his and their becoming embroiled in a heated debate over 
abortion and other emotional social issues. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is Bush the first to adopt such a tactic. John F. Kennedy elevated Arthur 
J. Goldberg and Byron R. White from within the ranks of his Administration over 
more qualified jurists. When trying to fill a vacancy in 1930, Herbert H. 
Hoover picked an ostensibly non-controversial conservative appellate judge, 
John J. Parker, over the widely respected Benjamin N. Cardozo. But controversy 
soon erupted over Parker's record and potential hostility toward blacks and 
labor. Following Parker's embarrassing defeat, Hoover was virtually forced to 
give Cardozo his next appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Souter may indeed offer Bush a politically expedient way of avoiding political 
conflict. At age 50, single and on the federal bench fewer than four months, he 
has written no opinions for liberals or conservatives to scrutinize. That was 
undoubtedly attractive to Bush, but that is not all there is to his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Souter's nomination reflects fundamental changes in the politics of judicial 
selection and of the American presidency. Once the selection of Supreme Court 
nominees was a very personal decision of the President. That was the practice 
of presidents in the 19th Century and down through the last appointment to the 
court by a Democratic President 23 years ago. Winning the presidential nod, as 
Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone put it, was like winning a "lottery" in which the 
President handpicked his favorite from a pool of more-or-less qualified 
individuals. This practice generally worked well, though some of F.D.R.'s and 
Harry S. Truman's appointees were not very good. Besides, Presidents at least 
had personal knowledge of their nominees and how they might reasonably perform 
on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
With the growth of the institutionalized presidency, however, Presidents have 
increasingly delegated more responsibility for judicial selection to their 
subordinates. Not only do their advisers have greater influence; they make 
politically calculated recommendations on who should be appointed and how a 
nominee will benefit the President and his party. No Republican President since 
William H. Taft has been deeply and personally involved in making his 
nominations to the court. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was no exception. While he only met Souter for the first time just two 
days before announcing his nomination, Souter had an inside track because of 
his friendship with the President's chief of staff, John H. Sununu. As governor 
of New Hampshire, in 1982, Sununu elevated Souter to that state's Supreme 
Court. Last year, Sununu prevailed on Bush to give Souter a seat on the federal 
appellate bench. With little personal knowledge of his nominee, Bush accepts 
Sununu's judgment and asks supporters to again read his lips. 
</P>
<P>
When compared with other Presidents, Bush's strategy is almost a replay of 
Gerald R. Ford's 1975 appointment of Justice John Paul Stevens. Then, as now, 
the court was poised to change dramatically due to Nixon's four previous 
appointments. When William O. Douglas' seat opened up, the justices were often 
divided 5-4 or 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Ford's advisers were sharply split over who he should appoint. One 
faction pushed for a woman; another championed Bork. But Ford feared a bitter 
confirmation battle over a controversial conservative nominee. So he named 
Stevens, a moderately conservative and relatively unknown federal judge. Women 
were disappointed and conservatives continue to chafe at Ford's choice, but 
Stevens sailed through the confirmation process. 
</P>
<P>
Like Ford and unlike Reagan, Bush passed up an opportunity to make a 
politically bold and symbolic appointment by naming a woman, a black, a Latino, 
or a well-known conservative. Clearly, Bush cares more about the short run than 
the court's long-term future and its impact on American politics.
