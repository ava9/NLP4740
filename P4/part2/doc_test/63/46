FT  07 NOV 94 / The US Goes to the Polls: The showdown in the states
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WASHINGTON
Not since 1860 has a sitting Speaker of the House of Representatives lost an
election, but Tom Foley, whom the Constitution ranks third behind the
president, faces his toughest campaign since winning in 1964. Lawyer George
Nethercutt has benefitted from the national anti-incumbent tide, and the
cash from Republican groups outside the state.
CALIFORNIA
Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein was expected to cruise to re-election,
but republican oil millionaire Michael Huffington is running her close after
spending Dollars 16m on television advertising. Feinstein fought back, after
Huffington was hurt by news that he employed an illegal immigrant as a
nanny. Republican Governor Pete Wilson seems set for a second term.
TEXAS
Democratic Governor Ann Richards is still popular, and most voters say she
is doing a good job. But she has faced a tough campaign against Republican
George Bush, another son of the former president, and co-owner of the Texas
Rangers baseball team. However, Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison is
having no trouble warding off Democrat Richard Fisher.
TENNESSEE
Democrats expected a battle to hold onto the Senate seat vacated by Vice
President Al Gore. Congressman Jim Cooper, best known for his centrist
healthcare reform plan, is trailing Republican lawyer/actor Fred Thompson.
The Democrats are more surprised by the struggle for Senator Jim Sasser, who
won with 65 per cent six years ago.
FLORIDA
Democratic Governor Lawton Chiles was elected to the Florida legislature in
1958 and has not lost an election since, but Jeb Bush has mounted a
ferocious attack. Little divides the two in the polls, but the gulf is wide
on issues such as immigration, crime and education, where Bush stands far to
the right of his father, former President George Bush.
VIRGINIA
He has been convicted of lying to Congress over the Iran-Contra affair and
denounced by fellow Republicans including former President Ronald Reagan,
but Oliver North's Senate campaign rolls on with the backing of the
Christian right wing. Democratic Senator Chuck Robb, once the darling of his
party, has run a lacklustre campaign.
PENNSYLVANIA
Senator Harris Wofford's surprise victory in a 1991 by-election launched the
debate about healthcare reform, but its defeat this year hurt him.
Congressman Rick Santorum is way to the right of most Republicans who have
won in Pennsylvania, but his opposition to gun control and calls for
congressional reform have given him a narrow lead.
NEW JERSEY
Governor Christine Todd Whitman swept New Jersey last year with a promise to
cut taxes, and the Republicans had hoped to repeat her victory in the Senate
election this year. But Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg seems to have
retaken the lead over Republican Chuck Haytaian.
NEW YORK
Governor Mario Cuomo faces a tough challenge in his bid for a fourth term.
Republican George Pataki has the backing of a powerful political machine but
little support of his own. Cuomo has struck back in recent weeks, however,
winning the endorsement of Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York.
MICHIGAN
Democrats are on the verge of losing the seat to Spencer Abraham, a former
aide to ex-Vice President Dan Quayle. Abraham appears to hold a narrow edge
over Congressman Bob Carr, whose brand of inside-Washington pork barrel
politics has failed to excite Democratic voters. Abraham is helped by
Republican Governor John Engler's smooth ride to re-election.
MINNESOTA
Republican Senator Dave Durenberger's retirement seemed to offer the
Democrats a good chance of winning a state from their rivals. But most polls
show that Anna Wynia, a left-of-centre state lawmaker, trails Congressman
Rod Grams, a right-winger who has campaigned against congressional
privileges.
