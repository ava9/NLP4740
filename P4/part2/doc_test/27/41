A World War II-vintage airplane crashed onto California 163 Monday, injuring 
the plane's two occupants and forcing authorities to close northbound lanes of 
the freeway for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, a single-engine, four-seat Navion once used for training military 
pilots, crashed shortly after taking off from Montgomery Field about 1 p.m., 
said Miguel Duenas, an operations assistant at the city-owned airfield. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, Lawrence David Smith, 51, and his passenger, Wayne Gibson, 60, both 
of San Diego, were taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital. Both were listed in 
serious but stable condition with back injuries, said Gwen Barnett, a 
spokeswoman for the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the plane began to surge and appeared to lose power soon after 
it became airborne, said Joe Garrison, a field operations officer for the 
California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
"The tower saw them take a dive," Garrison said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane touched down less than a mile from the airport, skidding across the 
four northbound lanes of California 163 south of the Balboa Avenue exit before 
striking the concrete center divider. 
</P>
<P>
When the crash occurred, the plane was probably going about 35 m.p.h., Garrison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters reached the scene "within two minutes," said Capt. Al Macdonald of 
the San Diego Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The plane did not hit any cars on the freeway, and there was no fire. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was a fire, we would have had two deceased people on our hands," 
Macdonald said. "No cars were hit, which is a miracle in itself." 
</P>
<P>
Because Smith and Gibson were trapped, rescuers were forced to remove the 
plane's canopy to pull them from the cockpit, Macdonald said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers moved quickly to divert traffic off the northbound lanes of the 
freeway at its interchange with Interstate 805. Firefighters doused the crash 
area with a fire-retardant chemical as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
In all, about 40 firefighters and 15 CHP officers responded to the accident, 
along with an unknown number of San Diego police officers. 
</P>
<P>
About 2 p.m., workers loaded the plane onto a flatbed truck and hauled it back 
to Montgomery Field for inspection by federal aircraft crash investigators. 
Minutes later, CHP officers reopened the road. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Reynolds, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman, said the cause of 
the accident was not known. The plane's destination also was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Duenas said the plane was regularly stored at Montgomery Field, and Smith was a 
co-owner of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the damage to its nose cone, the plane appeared to have been in very 
good condition externally, Macdonald said. 
</P>
<P>
Navion planes were used to train military pilots during World War II, and 
production of Navion models continued into the late 1940s, Macdonald said, 
adding, "They're like Cadillacs, they're built real strong." 
</P>
<P>
After emergency personnel and reporters gathered near the scene, an altercation 
apparently broke out between a police officer and a television news cameraman. 
</P>
<P>
While Channel 8 reporter Gina Lew was reporting on the crash live from nearby 
Kearny Villa Road, an officer climbed on top of the station's van, covered the 
TV camera's lens with his hand, and pushed it away from the scene, Lew said. 
</P>
<P>
Lew said the officer told the camera crew that its van was obstructing traffic 
on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"We were kind of surprised," Lew said. "We think (the officer) overreacted."
