Slower traffic and more congestion will accompany a three-month road-widening 
project now under way on Pacific Coast Highway between Golden West Street and 
Beach Boulevard, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.5-million project, which began Oct. 1, will widen the highway from two 
to three lanes in each direction. 
</P>
<P>
However, engineering manager Jack Miller said, the project will consume 526 
parking spaces that must be replaced before the new lanes can be installed. 
</P>
<P>
The city plans to build a 300-space parking lot on the ocean side of Pacific 
Coast Highway between 11th and Golden West streets. Miller said the city also 
wants to construct a 226-space lot north of the Huntington Beach Municipal 
Pier. 
</P>
<P>
The road-widening project, paid for with county Unified Transportation Trust 
funds, will also repair the deteriorating asphalt surface on the 2-mile section 
of road. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic engineers said drivers should seek alternative routes through the area 
between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. JON NALICK
