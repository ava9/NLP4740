<P>
A girl who was killed in a flaming, head-on collision on Coast Highway was 
identified Monday as Valerie Hacker, 16, of Newport Beach, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl died of injuries suffered in the fire caused by the Sunday night 
traffic collision, Orange County Deputy Coroner C. Ellingburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred when a Jeep Wagoneer traveling south on Coast Highway 
veered to avoid hitting a car coming from an exit road in the affluent, seaside 
Emerald Bay community. Authorities said the Jeep driver pulled into the 
opposite lane to avoid the collision, but hit a BMW headed northbound. 
</P>
<P>
Hacker was in the Jeep, as were two other injured people, according to police. 
The driver of the BMW was also injured in the crash, which sparked a fire that 
spread to a house and closed the road to traffic for half an hour.
