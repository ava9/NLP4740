A Mission Viejo man plowed through a marked Caltrans work area early this 
morning, slamming his van into a highway maintenance truck, killing himself and 
a freeway worker on the southbound 405 Freeway in Irvine, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Eularlio Castillo, 38, and Kevin Smith, 25, of Lancaster, who was 
employed by a company on contract with Caltrans, were pronounced dead at the 
scene, said California Highway Patrol Officer Angel Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
A second worker, Robert Ornales, 25, of La Puente, was also injured in the 
crash. He is in fair condition with back injuries at a Mission Viejo hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at 12:10 a.m. as Smith and a crew were repainting white 
stripes and replacing reflective lane markers on the southbound San Diego 
Freeway near Irvine Center Drive. 
</P>
<P>
At speeds in excess of 80 m.p.h., Castillo apparently drove through a barrier 
of cones onto the closed portion of the freeway, slamming into the back of a 
flatbed truck carrying Smith and one other worker, Johnson said.
