<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The utilization of traffic engineering principles and expertise in the planning, design, construction, and maintenance
of the public roadways, and in the application of traffic control devices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A traffic control device plan which includes:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An inventory of all traffic control devices;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Periodic review of existing traffic control devices, including a systematic upgrading of substandard devices to
conform with standards endorsed by the Federal Highway Administrator;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A maintenance schedule adequate to insure proper operation and timely repair of control devices, including daytime
and nighttime inspections;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
And where appropriate, the application and evaluation of new ideas and concepts in applying control devices and in
the modification of existing devices to improve their effectiveness through controlled experimentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An implementation schedule which utilizes traffic engineering resources to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Review road projects during the planning, design, and construction stages to detect and correct features that may
lead to operational safety difficulties;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Install safety-related improvements as part of routine maintenance and/or repair activities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Correct conditions noted during routine operational surveillance of the roadway system to rapidly adjust for the
changes in traffic and road characteristics as a means of reducing the frequency and severity of crashes;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conduct traffic engineering analyses of all high crash locations and the development of corrective measures;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analyze potentially hazardous locations_such as sharp curves, steep grades, and railroad grade crossings_and
develop appropriate countermeasures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Identify traffic control needs and determine short and long range requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evaluate the effectiveness of specific traffic control measures in reducing the frequency and severity of traffic
crashes;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conduct traffic engineering studies to establish traffic regulations, such as fixed or variable speed limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A method to ensure a continuing statewide inventory of pedestrian-motor vehicle crashes identifying the location
and times of the crash, as well as the age of the pedestrian and circumstances of the incident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statewide operational procedures for improving the protection of pedestrians through the application of traffic
engineering practices, careful land-use planning in newly developed areas, physical separation of pedestrian
pathways from vehicle roadways, and environmental illumination of high volume and/or potentially hazardous pedestrian
crossings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Periodic evaluation of each of the Roadway Safety projects by the State, or appropriate Federal department or agency
where applicable. The evaluation should provide information detailing the program's effectiveness in terms of
crash reduction and the end results of crashes, and the Federal Highway Administration should be provided with an
evaluation summary.
