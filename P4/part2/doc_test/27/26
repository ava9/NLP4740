Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
For years there has been a major problem experienced by Disneyland visitors who 
wish to go north on the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
After exiting the park and proceeding north on West Street, they must turn 
right onto Ball Road, then work their way over to the left-hand lanes so that, 
once they've crossed the freeway, they can make a left turn across the 
westbound lanes and onto the freeway entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans is building a new bridge where Ball Road crosses the freeway. It is my 
understanding that when this new bridge is completed, Disneyland visitors will 
still have to work their way over to the left lanes on this new bridge so they 
can make a left turn across traffic on Ball Road to reach the freeway entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Why would anyone spend millions of dollars on a new bridge without making 
provision to safely handle the many cars traveling east on Ball Road that would 
like to enter the northbound Santa Ana Freeway? 
</P>

That freeway entrance is a doozy, the kind that makes motorists wish they were 
safely back on the Autopia in the Magic Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
But officials at Caltrans have a ready explanation for why they won't be 
eliminating the troublesome left turn on Ball Road. 
</P>
<P>
Given their druthers, the agency's highway engineers admit they would like to 
install a cloverleaf-type freeway entrance that would siphon eastbound traffic 
off Ball Road's right-hand lane and swing it on a curving strip of asphalt down 
onto the northbound Santa Ana Freeway. No muss, no fuss and no left-hand turn. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the land needed for such a serpentine freeway ramp is occupied 
by a motel. Caltrans officials say the agency cannot justify purchasing the 
property and removing the motel just for a new freeway ramp. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they plan to do the next best thing. As part of the bridge 
construction, Caltrans will erect a new left-turn signal and add an extra 
left-turn lane off Ball Road onto the northbound Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the new turn lanes and traffic light, which will be 
synchronized with signals on nearby Harbor Boulevard, will help all those 
Mouseketeer groupies and Tinkerbell fans get onto the freeway a whole lot 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
Like everyone in the Los Angeles Basin, I have become increasingly concerned 
with our traffic problems. The only solutions I see being offered appear to 
involve large sums of money and long-term projects. 
</P>
<P>
The solution is to reduce the number of vehicles on the road. The obvious 
answer is car-pooling. Unfortunately, most people give up on the idea because 
of the hassles involved in coordinating everyone. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to see local newspapers run advertising at no charge to commuters 
listing where people live and work, using the coordinates from a Thomas 
Brothers map book. This would provide a quick reference for people who live and 
work near one another and who have similar work schedules to form a car pool. 
</P>
<P>
Many large companies use a similar system for their employees. I am suggesting 
that this could be tried on an areawide basis. 
</P>
<P>
Much has been written about the number of single-driver vehicles on the 
freeways. I think this plan could be a very logical way to reduce that number 
and speed up traffic on our freeway system, and it could be done with the least 
cost to the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>

It's nice to see someone thinking about promoting car-pooling, which many 
transportation experts say is an important weapon in the battle to ease traffic 
congestion in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Those same experts, however, say that putting together such a commuter bulletin 
board in local newspapers might prove ineffective, since many residents are 
squeamish about public listings of their addresses and phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Also, there is already a program to serve this purpose. It is called Commuter 
Computer, and it offers motorists information about others who live and work 
near them in an effort to encourage the formation of car pools. 
</P>
<P>
Those interested can call Commuter Computer at (714) 636-RIDE for information 
on car pools, van pools and the nearest park-and-ride lot. 
</P>
<P>
A very valid point. Seat belts save lives. Just ask any CHP officer or 
ambulance driver. Street Smart encourages motorists to use them, even if they 
sometime wrinkle your tie or blouse.
