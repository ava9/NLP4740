Coast Highway, the main thoroughfare through Newport Beach, has been under 
construction for about three years. But Public Works Director Ben Nolan says 
that while some portions are nearly finished, other phases to widen and improve 
the road won't be completed until 1992 and are expected to affect summer 
traffic.

<P>
Currently, there are three major roadwork projects under way in the city. The 
projects include widening of East Coast Highway between Bayside Drive and 
Jamboree Road, improvements and widening of West Coast Highway between Newport 
Boulevard and Highland Street, and the addition of a ramp and turning lane to 
the Newport Channel Bridge.

City officials say that work on East Coast Highway is nearly finished. The 
project was started in April, 1989, and is the second phase of cooperative city 
and federal project which also included road repairs as far east as MacArthur 
Boulevard.

The $5-million project, which City Manager Robert L. Wynn said was more than 
99% completed, was undertaken ease traffic congestion. The work included 
rehabilitation of the roadway, and widening the section of street to six lanes 
plus turning lanes. 
</P>
<P>
The city funded 14% of the cost of these repairs, and the remainder was 
financed by federal funds, according to city engineer John Wolter. 
</P>
<P>
The second Coast Highway construction project is about 70% done, Wynn said. For 
$12.1 million, public works officials say, the roadway between the Arches 
Bridge interchange and Highland Street was widened from four lanes to six. 
Ramps were added to Hoag Hospital property.LAURA MICHAELIS
