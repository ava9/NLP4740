IN EUROPE'S NAME: GERMANY AND THE DIVIDED CONTINENT by Timothy Garton Ash
Jonathan Cape Pounds 25, 680 pages
IN FEBRUARY 1989, during an interview with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, I asked
why he no longer used the word 'Wiedervereinigung' (reunification) to
describe West Germany's constitutional goal of unity with East Germany. Kohl
said he preferred the phrase 'Einheit der Nation' (unity of the nation).
'Under Wiedervereinigung one understood something else, the attachment of
the GDR (East Germany) to the Federal Republic,' he explained. 'Isn't that
the idea?' I persisted. 'The idea - the vision - is that we want the
political unity of Europe,' the chancellor replied, somewhat lamely. When I
rammed home the question again, Kohl burst out: 'The difference is that you
are a prophet, and I am only the chancellor.'
That dialogue - just nine months before the fall of the Berlin Wall, and 20
months before Kohl became chancellor of united Germany - certainly shows how
unification came as a surprise. It also neatly illustrates a theme at the
centre of Timothy Garton Ash's immaculate account of German post-war
Ostpolitik.
Successive West German chancellors believed that 'reunification' could only
take place as part of a gradual move towards ending the overall division of
Europe that formed the (apparently) enduring legacy of Hitler's war.
In view of their belief that a speedy 'attachment' of the GDR was
impossible, West German governments during the 1970s and 1980s concentrated
on stabilising East Germany politically and economically. By improving the
lot of East Germans, they believed the policy would facilitate democratic
reforms - judged the best long-term route to reforging the nation.
In fact, West Germany's unjustified confidence in East Germany's solidity
prevented rather than furthered reforms east of the Elbe. But, at a time
when Michail Gorbachev was trying to remodel Soviet communism, East
Germany's out-of-touch leaders' refusal to follow suit dramatically
increased their own unpopularity and their state's economic problems.
West and East German illusions about East Germany's ability to survive thus
reinforced each other. Collapse into the arms of its prosperous, alarmed
neighbour-brother became inevitable, precisely because it was unexpected.
Garton Ash's teasingly dialectical writing style is well suited to
describing a plot of Smileyesque convolutedness. Unique sensitivities
surrounded (and surround still) German reunification. The path to it was
thus a game of mirrors. From Konrad Adenauer's time onward, no policy, no
action, no statement, no objective, no outcome - and certainly no
politician's after-the-event account of any of these things - could ever be
taken at face value.
This was a cautious journey, not only two-track, but also in two directions
at once. Efforts first to form and then to develop relationships with the
Soviet Union and the GDR would succeed only if Bonn at the same time made
maximum efforts to extend its anchor within the European Community and Nato.
Two points stand out. The first is that the Soviet Union, with a taste for
and understanding of Realpolitik surpassing that of the word's original
inventors, had a good idea all along of what was going on. Referring to the
reasons behind Chancellor Willy Brandt's overtures to East Berlin, Leonid
Brezhnev warned East German leader-to-be Erich Honecker in 1970: 'He expects
to penetrate you.' Brezhnev added (half-correctly), 'But with time he will
find that ever harder.'
The Soviet Union had far more insight than West Germany into East Germany's
true weakness, and also probably during the 1980s sensed it would not send
in the Red Army should Honecker's power totter. Gorbachev was charmed by
Kohl's daringly sentimental talk - during a walk by the Rhine in June 1989 -
of how reunification would be in both nations' long term interests.
An agonising choice for Gorbachev, to be sure. German unification might well
profit Russia. First, however, as part of the dismantling of the Stalinist
order, the Soviet empire would have to disappear.
The second point relates to West Germany's relations with its eastern and
western European neighbours. The Federal Republic's transmutation into a
modern, efficient, non-revanchist EC state - both model and magnet -
increased its economic power and its reputation as a reliable partner.
Because everyone in Europe (Bonn included) believed Wiedervereinigung was no
longer feasible, the Federal Republic, almost imperceptibly, gained the
leverage and muscle to put it speedily into effect when the chance came.
After the Wall fell, Margaret Thatcher's unrealistic (and small-mindeded)
assessment that Kohl should try to delay reunification matched the
chancellor's equally inaccurate avowal (in 1988) that he would not live to
see it.
As he applies his spatula to this canvas of paradox and dilemma, Garton Ash
paints in the emotions as well as the politics guiding the practitioners of
Ostpolitik. The Social Democrats' veteran strategist, Egon Bahr, is rebuked
 -despite the brilliance and eventual success of his 1963 concept of Wandel
durch Annaherung (change through rapprochement) - for increasing the SPD's
disarray in 1980s dealings with East Berlin.
For all the book's copiousness, there are some lacunae. More detailed
treatment of Bonn's late-1980s dispute with the allies over short-range
nuclear missiles - crucial to inspiring solidarity among East and West
Germans, since they would be the only people killed if the weapons were ever
fired - would have been welcome. Garton Ash glosses over the remarkable lack
of curiosity towards East Germany by the West German media - cause and
effect of declining belief in Wiedervereinigung.
While he offers the exceedingly general precepts that united Germany should
redefine its national interests and avoid 'emotional over-reaction', Garton
Ash ducks analysis of the effects of unification on the rest of Europe. Kohl
sees his new twin-track task as combining German unity with European unity.
Successfully steering both processes may, however, prove as daunting as
anything faced by the architects of Ostpolitik.
