Karl Schiller

Professor Karl Schiller, who has died at 83, was the West German
'super-minister' who came spectacularly to grief in a conflict with the
Bundesbank over exchange controls in 1972.
His resignation as economics and finance minister in defence of free market
economics and strong budgetary policies in July of that year unsettled the
Social Democrat-led coalition government of Chancellor Willy Brandt and, for
a period, appeared to jeopardise its electoral prospects.
But Schiller lost influence after an ill-judged dalliance with the Christian
Democrat opposition party ahead of the general election that November.
Although he continued to be highly regarded as an economist, the re-election
of Willy Brandt's left-liberal coalition meant Schiller was never again a
political force in Germany.
Karl Schiller was born on April 24, 1911 in Breslau (now Wroclaw), in what
was then German Silesia. After studying economics at the universities of
Kiel, Frankfurt-am-Main, Berlin and Heidelberg, he began an academic career
at Heidelberg in 1934 before moving in 1935 to the Institute for World
Economy in Kiel where he headed a research group. After serving in the
German army in the second world war, he returned briefly to Kiel before
becoming professor of economics at Hamburg university, where he was rector
between 1956 and 1958.
Schiller's involvement in politics began in 1946, when he joined the Social
Democrat party. By 1948 he was economic senator in the federal state of
Hamburg and an adviser to the economics ministry in Bonn. By the time the
Social Democrats and Christian parties formed West Germany's 'grand
coalition' government in 1966, Schiller had held numerous party offices and
was a member of the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament. He had played
a key role in steering his party away from traditional socialism towards
free market economic policies.
He was appointed federal economics minister in 1966 and for a time formed a
remarkable partnership with Franz-Josef Strauss, the finance minister. At
first sight, the young-looking, slight, bespectacled, didactic academic from
Hamburg hardly seemed the type to coexist with the burly, beer-swilling
leader of Bavaria's Christian Social Union. But Strauss was also a gifted,
highly educated man with a powerful intellect. The two developed a mutual
respect.
Together they steered the German economy to recovery after a shallow
recession in 1967. However, tensions grew over how to respond to upward
pressure on the D-Mark in the increasingly enfeebled post-war Bretton Woods
fixed exchange rate regime. Breaking with conventional business opinion,
Schiller came to recognise that revaluation was unavoidable.
When the coalition broke up in 1969, Schiller was one of the Social Democrat
party's stars. His intellect, communication skills and mastery of economic
policy, combined with the respect Germans of that time had for professors,
were important in winning the electorate for the unknown: a Social
Democrat-led government.
With hindsight, the election of September 29, 1969 was Schiller's high-water
mark. He returned to government as economics minister - this time in a
coalition with the Free Democrats. But storm clouds were gathering over the
West German economy, largely because of its trading success relative to
other industrialised nations.
At Schiller's behest, one of the new government's first acts was to revalue
the D-Mark to DM3.66 to the dollar compared with DM4 previously. This,
however, failed to stem the flow of speculative funds into Germany. Currency
turbulence in turn increased inflationary pressure as Bundesbank
intervention to curb the D-Mark's rise resulted in a sharp increase in
domestic money supply.
Schiller won a temporary respite for the D-Mark by floating it against the
dollar in May 1971. But the coalition also faced budgetary problems as it
tried to meet its election promises for greater social expenditure after
having promised not to raise taxes. Symptomatic of growing tension was the
resignation, also in May 1971, of West Germany's finance minister, Alex
Moller.
Schiller added Moller's portfolio to his own, becoming 'super-minister'. But
he found his authority increasingly challenged as he tried to secure support
in cabinet for spending cuts. Unrelenting speculative inflows into Germany,
particularly after the D-Mark was repegged against the dollar in December
1971, brought him into conflict with Karl Klasen, president of the
Bundesbank.
Klasen, like Schiller, was a Social Democrat from Hamburg. But there the
similarities ended. Tall, commanding, with a dislike of detail, Klasen had
come to the Bundesbank in 1970 from Deutsche Bank, Germany's most powerful
commercial bank. He was far more concerned than Schiller that the rising
value of the D-Mark would cripple the country's export industry.
Schiller was convinced of the need to revalue the D-Mark to safeguard
Germany from imported inflation and advocated a joint float of European
Community currencies to protect the country's competitiveness.
Tension between the two men reached crisis point at the end of June 1972
when Klasen, attending a cabinet meeting in Bonn, proposed exchange controls
to combat the inflow of funds into the D-Mark. In a long and bitter
resignation letter, Schiller complained that Klasen had sat next to him at a
European Community meeting in Luxembourg only two days before without
mentioning his plans, even though he had already advised the chancellery of
them. In the letter, Schiller acknowledged that he was in conflict with the
majority of the cabinet. 'In this war of attrition - rich in personal
defamations - the minister of finance and economics often stood alone,' he
wrote.
Without doubt, Schiller's tangled personal life added to his problems. Four
times wed, his marriage to his third wife, Eta, during 1971 attracted
unfavourable comment and hostility in the Social Democrat party and
undermined his standing.
His resignation from the cabinet was followed by his departure from the
party presidium and the party itself. In the months following his
resignation as a minister, there was intense speculation that Schiller would
join the Christian Democrats in opposition to the Brandt government. He
allowed his name to be used in the campaign against the governing coalition,
but never jumped fully into the opposition camp.
Schiller's waverings made enemies across the pol-itical spectrum. Even the
most charitable observers queried his judgment. Willy Brandt's election
victory left Schiller politically high and dry.
Schiller's policies, however, survived his political eclipse. The final
collapse of the Bretton Woods currency system in March 1973 meant that
Germany again floated the D-Mark. The exchange controls that provoked
Schiller's resignation had been inadequate to cope with huge currency
inflows in a time of widespread international currency turbulence.
Successive West German governments supported and promoted his idea of a
European joint float, leading to the creation of the European Monetary
System in 1979. That was in large part the achievement of another
super-minister: Helmut Schmidt, a pupil of Schiller's from Hamburg, who
succeeded him as minister of finance and economics in 1972 before becoming
chancellor in 1974.
The nature of Schiller's departure from government also had a profound
effect on economic and monetary affairs in Germany and beyond by
contributing to the reality and legend of Bundesbank power.
