    [Editorial Report] Berlin N-TV in German at 1010 GMT on 22 
June carried a live relay of the 77-minute speech delivered by 
Rudolf Scharping, leader of the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] to the SPD congress in Halle. 
  Scharping opened his speech by commenting on the huge 
expectations from the speech itself, regarded by some as the 
make-or-break speech for Scharping. He then stressed his 
support for the people of eastern Germany and strongly 
criticized the effects of 12 years of Kohl's rule on the people 
throughout Germany, particularly with regard to the welfare 
state. He said that following the defeat in the European 
elections the party has to fight more clearly and resolutely 
than before. He stressed that he is determined to win the 
election rather than come in second. 
  Scharping congratulated those who contributed to German 
unity, including the east European states. Referring to the 
achievement of the Social Democrats under Willy Brandt with 
regard to East-West relations, he stressed that Germany needs a 
new policy of the people and must take its international role 
seriously, bringing the people of Europe closer together. 
  Scharping then moved on to the subject of coalitions saying 
that his party intends to concentrate on its own policies and 
not on coalition speculation. He said that environmental, 
economic, and social policies must be considered in tandem and 
his party is not content to hand responsibility for one of these 
areas to, for example, the Greens. He then emphasized that he 
will seek to shake off his reputation for being characterless. 
  Moving onto the subject of taxes, he reiterated that high 
earners should not complain about high taxes and should never 
forget the poor. He said his party must go on the offensive and 
remove Helmut Kohl from government. Appealing to the east 
Germans never to forget what Kohl has done to them, he accused 
Kohl of deceiving people about the state of the economy and 
appealed to the people of the east not to vote for the Party of 
Democratic Socialism out of disillusionment. He added that his 
party wants an economic upswing, but not false optimism. 
  Stressing that his party wants tax exemption for those 
living 
on the poverty line, he said that the government has sacrificed 
people for the sake of competitiveness. Any upswing has to be 
accompanied by sound environmental policies and has to be in the 
interest of all. He added that the right wing will not be 
allowed to flourish under the SPD and condemned attacks on 
foreigners. 
  In conclusion, he stressed that the SPD wants a unified 
Germany that is strong economically, has good ecological 
policies, and lives up to its responsibilities to Europe and the 
world. 
  Scharping received a standing ovation at the end of his 
speech.
