<F P=106> [Report by Bela Anda and Kai Diekmann: "Was He the Super </F>
Spy?"] 
  [Text] Whenever something happened in Bonn, he was 
present, and he knew all the state secrets -- Karl Wienand (67), 
Social Democratic Party [SPD] floor leader from 1967 through 
1974, is suspected of having worked not only for the Stasi but 
also for the KGB. Wienand was questioned all day yesterday in 
the Federal Prosecutor General's Office in Karlsruhe. The SPD 
politician continues to reject strictly all charges. According 
to information obtained by BILD, a new witness has incriminated 
Wienand so seriously that the federal prosecutor general will 
formally indict him next week. If the grave suspicion were to 
be confirmed, the Wienand case would be the greatest case of 
treason in the Federal Republic's history. 
  It was for years a great mystery in Bonn. Who is the super 
spy? Defectors from the East had provided leads time and again. 
Stasi Chief Markus Wolf also made vague indications following 
the change. 
  Now the formerly powerful SPD politician, Karl Wienand, is 
in 
the focus. He was in the center of power more than anyone else 
and was Herbert Wehner's closest confidant. Hardly anything 
happened in Bonn without him. 
  The question: Did he have secret contacts with the East in 
order to be of use to the people in both German states? Or what? 
  Karl Wienand was talked about time and time again -- 
sometimes for having received money as adviser for the 
"Paninternational" airliner, sometimes in connection with the 
bribery affair around Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Deputy 
Julius Steiner, who, in the no-confidence vote against Willy 
Brandt, voted for the SPD chancellor for 50,000 German marks. 
  What does Karl Wienand have to do with the Stasi? 
  Since August 1993, the federal public prosecutor general has 
investigated the SPD politician because of suspected 
"intelligence activities." For a salary of 10,000 German marks 
per month, he allegedly collaborated with the Stasi. The Stasi 
kept him under the cover name of "Streit." This is what 
Wienand's former control officer, Stasi captain Alfred Voelkel 
(cover name "Krueger"), claims. 
  Having been confronted with Wienand, the Stasi man withdrew 
his testimony. Wienand also disputed all charges. 
  According to information obtained by BILD, another former 
Stasi officer has now spilled the beans and reiterated the 
espionage charges against Wienand. The investigations are 
completed. Wienand will be indicted next week. 
  How important was Wienand for the Stasi? 
  On behalf of Herbert Wehner, Wienand held strictly secret 
talks with the GDR leadership in 1970 to establish "a 
continuous, unofficial political contact, in addition to the 
official negotiations." 
  In a secret Stasi document, it says: "Streit (alias Wienand) 
repeatedly stressed the absolute confidentiality, because 
otherwise, the SPD leadership would get into a lot of trouble." 
Nor must the Free Democratic Party [FDP] as a coalition partner 
"be informed under any circumstances." 
  What did Wienand have to do with the KGB? 
  According to information obtained by BILD, Valentin Falin, 
the former Soviet Ambassador to Bonn, met with Willy Brandt in 
the latter's Bonn office in the second half of March 1992. 
According to confidants, Falin hinted that Karl Wienand was a 
KGB agent. 
  Brandt informed the Federal Intelligence Service in 
Munich-Pullach. 
  Asked by BILD, former Ambassador Falin denied the meeting 
with Brandt: "There was never a talk with Brand on any Wienand 
contacts with the KGB." 
  What is strange, however, is that, asked by BILD, Brandt's 
widow, Brigitte Seebacher-Brandt, remembered the Falin-Brandt 
meeting in the second half of March 1992 very clearly....
