  [Text] Did Kohl want to go to Normandy or did he not? 
After long guesswork, now there came a clear German no. The 
chancellor never thought of attending the celebrations on the 
50th anniversary of the Allied landing; it would be 
"inappropriate." 
  Well then: On 6 June, almost all of Europe will celebrate, 
and the supreme European ducks his head and lifts it only two 
days later for the reconciliation event in Heidelberg. 
  One does not feel comfortable about that. However, on the 
other hand, this is better for everyone. Kohl would just feel 
uncomfortable at Omaha Beach, and one would hardly know what to 
do with him. At home all those would be angry with him who 
still consider the "invasion" as an ignominy. Those, on the 
other hand, who see D-Day as an important step toward the 
liberation from fascism would have to be afraid that Kohl does 
something embarrassing. 
  Or does anyone remember that he has ever been brilliant at 
any event that dealt with the fascist past? As much as one 
ponders, the only thing that comes to mind is the ghostly event 
at the soldiers' cemetery of Bitburg. Yes, if there were still 
Willy Brandt or if there were still any politicians who never 
had problems in Volgograd! Kohl, however, likes to present 
himself in many shapes, but no one has ever got the idea of 
seeing him as the personification of antifascism. If he had 
ended up at the Atlantic beach on 6 June, he would indeed have 
stood around there as the representative of the vanquished. 
  No, June is not a good month. Only in late summer will Kohl 
thrive again. Then he will wave farewell to the last Russians, 
forgiving them for their grandfathers' having once come to our 
country. Shortly afterwards, Berlin will be completely free from 
the Allies. This is a way of coping with history that Kohl likes. 
  However, in May 1995 things will get delicate again. Oh, why 
do we not have a chancellor whom we can show on all days! It 
would be appropriate.
