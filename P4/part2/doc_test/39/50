LEADING members of all the main political parties in the German parliament
have now called for a reconsideration of the timetable for transferring the
government and Bundestag to Berlin.
The most prominent supporter of the transfer to call for a delay has been Mr
Willy Brandt, former chancellor and former mayor of Berlin, who last week
spelt out his concerns about mounting costs.
Budget spokesmen for the ruling Christian Democrat/Free Democrat coalition
government and the Social Democratic opposition in Bonn recently called for
the move to be delayed because of financial restraints resulting from the
transfer of government funds to east Germany. This year the transfers are
expected to approach DM180bn (Pounds 63bn).
The government has not yet responded to the calls, except to say that no
such delay is under consideration.
Parliament had been expected to begin moving into the Reichstag in Berlin by
1996. The move to Berlin of most major ministries was expected to be
completed by 2004.
Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer, the building minister, has said that construction
costs could total up to DM10bn, and some 50,000 people would be transferred
to Berlin. But the parliamentary committee responsible has seen no proper
estimates.
It now seems clear that the Bundestag will not be in a position to approve a
precise transfer plan before the summer break at the end of June - as
originally planned. The costing needs to be completed and agreement reached
on dividing future government functions between Berlin and Bonn.
Meanwhile, Berlin politicians have expressed anger and bitterness over the
proposals.
Mr Peter Radunski, the senior Berlin official responsible for relations with
the federal government, replied testily that the move to Berlin was a
question of 'political will and not financial possibilities'. If there was a
shortage of funds, the scale and opulence of the official building projects
in Berlin should be reduced, he argued.
'Without an economic recovery in Berlin, there will be no economic recovery
in the east,' he said.
