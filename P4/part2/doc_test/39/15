BONN would like Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader, to attend
the memorial service in Berlin for Mr Willy Brandt, the former German
chancellor, in spite of a Russian ban on his leaving the country.
A government spokesman in Bonn confirmed the official attitude yesterday,
but insisted that Chancellor Helmut Kohl had taken no initiative to persuade
the Russian government to allow Mr Gorbachev to leave the country for the
occasion.
Unofficial reports said the German chancellor was 'greatly concerned' about
the travel ban on the former Soviet leader, and had instructed his officials
to do what they could to have it changed.
Bild am Sonntag, the mass-circulation Sunday newspaper, said Mr Kohl had
told his staff: 'We must do something. If he is not allowed to come, it
would be a scandal.'
The German Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the report yesterday, but
a government spokesman said the government would welcome Mr Gorbachev's
attendance at the memorial service for Mr Brandt, scheduled for next
Saturday in Berlin.
He was unable to confirm whether Mr Gorbachev had already been officially
invited.
The travel ban was imposed on Mr Gorbachev after he refused to give evidence
before the Russian constitutional court into the activities of the Soviet
Communist party.
